A. Prepare Files

Windows/Mac/Linux
1) Unzip the Capstone_Project folder.
2) Unzip the randomForestClassifier.zip file and place the unzipped file in Capstone_Project/models.
3) Install the python library "virtualenv" through conda or pip if you don't already have it.

B. Create Virtual Environment and Install Libraries from the command line

Linux/Mac

1) Create a new virtual environment: type "virtualenv name"
2) Activate the new virtual environment: type "source name/bin/activate"
3) Navigate to the project root directory Capstone_Project
3) Install the needed python libraries: type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4) Install the needed nltk libraries: type "python installNLTKLibraries.py"

Windows:
1) Create a new virtual environment: type "virtualenv name"
2) Navigate to name\Scripts\
3) Activate the virtual environment: type "activate.bat"
4) Navigate to the project root directory Capstone_Project
5) Install the needed python libraries: type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
6) Install the needed nltk libraries: type "python installNLTKLibraries.py"


If the above does not work and you have the anaconda python distribution installed, follow these steps:
Windows
1) Create a new virtual environment with the needed libraries: type "conda create --name env_name --file requirements.txt"
2) Activate the environment: type "activate env_name"
3) Navigate to the project root directory Capstone_Project
4) Install the needed python libraries: type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
5) Install the needed nltk libraries: type "python installNLTKLibraries.py"
