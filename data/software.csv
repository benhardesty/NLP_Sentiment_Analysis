My initial reaction to Money 2004 was negative, but I got used to it over time. My new bank only provides downloads to Quicken, which makes sense given Money's extinction, forcing me to migrate back to Quicken. I can't say that I'm very impressed.

The interface is very clunky; I doubt it's improved at all in the five years I've been away. (Even Microsoft Money 2004 had a cleaner interface, and Microsoft undoubtedly improved on it over the years.) There are too many different levels of menus -- top-level, register-level, account-level, and more -- which makes use of the product confusing. The one thing I really appreciated about Quicken in the past is thankfully still there: when you balance an account, you have the option of deselecting all qualifying items and then reselecting them one at a time. (In Money 2004, you would have had to manually deselect all of the items.) This allows you to balance your account by ticking off transactions one-by-one.

The product is for some reason dependent on Internet Explorer; when I wanted to register Quicken and when I wanted to download a program update, I had to make Internet Explorer my default browser (otherwise, it's Mozilla). This is annoying, and I don't recall any other non-Microsoft product having this restriction.

I had difficulty setting up one of my banks for automatic download. This is definitely a result of the way that the bank's security is set up, but Quicken (the program; I haven't contacted technical support) has not been helpful in providing clues about how to resolve the problem. (It did provide an inconvenient workaround, but I would like the problem to be fixed.)

I do not like the way that the program promotes fee-for-service programs like billpay that you can get through Quicken.com. This is only a minor annoyance, but it's built into the program.

In all, Quicken seems like it will do the job I need it to, but it's not elegant or fun. Unfortunately, it's the only game in town.

Note that I have not used any of the features that distinguish Home & Business from its less expensive siblings, so I can't comment on them yet.",A bit on the clunky side,1263081600,,

When it comes to the world of personal finance software, we as the general public have very limited choices.  I've used Quicken since the DOS days and moved over to Money, then back to Quicken.  My most recent version was 2006.  I booted it up and it told me it was time to upgrade because they will stop supporting online downloads come 4/30/09.  Initially I was pretty hacked off...like a lot of others here.  Then I took a deep breath, and did the math.  I think my Deluxe version cost me about $20 somewhere (eBay perhaps??) so let's do the math together shall we?  $20/3 years is about $6.67 a year.  Holy Break The Bank Batman!!  Seriously people. Quit griping.  How about you not drink 2 Starbucks all year long and put it in your ""Upgrade Quicken"" jar.

This upgrade cost me $39 direct from Quicken and took 17 minutes to download.  So let's do the math for the next 3 years, shall we? $39/3 years is a wallet busting $13 a year!!  Skip your $5 footlong at Subway 3 times all year long and you can afford the upgrade...amazing isn't it?

The upgrade was flawless on my XP machine.  Double-clicked the start-up icon and away we went.  It found my previous version and un-installed it, installed the new version and ran for the first time.  It immediately found an update so I accepted it.  After the update, the program opened to the main screen.  All of my files imported flawlessly and I was downloading my newest transactions immediately thereafter.

One of the best improvements is how you can copy digital images into the register.  In my old version, I had to save the file to my desktop and then add it through a few clicks.  Now all I have to do is right click the image, click copy, open Quicken attachment and paste from clipboard.  Genius I tell you!

The interface has a very ""gel"" ""XP"" look to it.  I'm not a real big fan of that look, but I'm not going to rate it 1 or 2 stars because of it.

All in all, the upgrade, download, install and running of the program worked great for me.  So if you're reading all of these 1 and 2 star reviews, I'm living proof the program works, and works well.",Seriously people...what's the problem?,1232668800,12.0,

While Microsoft did make some improvements, many changes have users frustrated and mad.

Pros

+ Standard version includes the 4 programs you actually want!
+ Like most new MS suites, allows for easier transfer between machines
+ Allows you to use on your home desktop AND your laptop!!  Huge plus!!
+ New open document format based on xml - good for techies
+ Alternatively, you can still use the doc format you know and love
+ Excel now supports larger documents with more fields!
+ Cool new Powerpoint extras
+ Once you do overcome the learning curve, design has some plusse
+ Preloaded with Vista OEM computers, so install is MUCH faster than old version

Cons

- A list price of $400 means many will forgo Outlook and buy Home & Student suite for MUCH LESS
- The ribbon puts things in WEIRD places
- Microsoft disabled classic menus so you can't find stuff ... ARGH!!!
- Startup times seem a little slower ... why????
- Strangely slow performance with Word

The general hatred for the ribbon is well known.  Microsoft Word and Excel have drawn the most heat.  It took everybody years to learn those nested menus and hard to find functions.  Now they are all moved!!!!

Actually, the ribbon wouldn't be so bad if you could have your regular old classic menus above it.  Once you learn the ribbon, there's some logic to the way things have been relocated.  Still, this was a huge blunder and I wonder if MS will back track on that.

Is Outlook worth $250 now? To be fair, there are cheaper upgrade versions.  Still, I may be switching to a new email / calendar / productivity program all-together.

The new XML doc format is Microsoft's way of getting away from the proprietary .doc format.  This will aggravate some people too, but you can just save everything in the 2003 format.  I like the new format and I think it will catch on with time.

Let me say up front that I have actually used it.  Also note that I have used quite a few different types previously, my favorite being Adobe Premiere Elements.

This version from Pinnacle is not by any means user friendly.  If you are a novice, you won't find that the process has a ""easily walks me through it"" design to it by any means.  It is, in fact, fairly difficult to do even basic things...like add titles or captions to the timeline.

You will see a tab toward the bottom called ""SmartMovie,"" that does make things a little bit simpler....but even with this option it's still not all that easy to navigate your way through the process.

Two main things about this software that I found fairly annoying:

1) If you want to view the online training videos from Pinnacle, you can only do so if you subscribe to their site for $7 per month....otherwise the video stops about a fourth of the way through and a pop-up pushes you to make this purchase.  Until you do, you're blocked from viewing the videos.

2) It does not burn to Blue-ray discs unless you download a plug-in that will allow this feature, which also costs $7 to download.  Really Pinnacle?  I mean....really?  Even the MyDVD software that comes with it has a burn to Blue-ray option on it, which is greyed out because you have not yet purchased the plug-in.  Horrible business model, IMO.

What I did manage to do was to burn a short 4GB AVCHD movie on a DVD DL disc, and I was able to include a title for it.  Oddly, the transition from one clip to another had special effects built in for switching from one clip to another...swiping from left to right, loading the next clip from the middle out, etc.  At first it was pretty cool to look at, but eventually it got annoying.  I was able to finally figure out from the manual how to go in and take the transitions out of the timeline.  It was strange to me that these special transition effects were set up by default.

When I tried to burn a larger, 10GB movie (as a side note, all of these are HD family vacation footage), of course I couldn't load it on a DVD DL disc due to its size, so I decided to save the file and then I would burn it from my Adobe software. Halfway through to exporting it to the folder, however, the Studio 20 software froze up and stopped exporting....so I had to close it.  BTW, I have a fairly robust PC....Core i7 CPU, 12GB RAM, etc.

Basically, unless you want software to make AVCHD movies less than 8.5GB in total size that will not burn to Blue-ray unless you download a plug-in at an additional cost, I would look elsewhere.  My suggestion is Adobe Premier Elements....that's the one I have had the most success with.  I can't recommend this one.","Not user friendly, and lacks some key features you should be aware of.",1474761600,15.0,

First of all it is a separate program, it is NOT integrated with PaintShop Pro.  FaceFilter is also the ""standard"" version not the ""pro"" version and thus you'll be frustrated and wanting the more expensive pro version.  The standard version lacks a *lot* of the overall features and basically is *only* for tweaking faces (and they should be more or less straight on angles) and is limited to 1920x1920 resolution (pro version can handle up to 6000x6000 pixel images).

PaintShop Pro X7 itself is a very well designed and capable photo editing program.

In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancy's nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief.
First, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a master's degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curator's office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest.
""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"" simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.
This is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. ""Scarlet Hand"" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and ""Scarlet Hand"" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey.

A lot of Microsoft staff was there. One quick note is that there were two types of staff. One wore red shirts, and the others wore blue shirts. The whole day seminar/presentation started with an explanation of, ""If you have a technical question, ask one of the Microsoft staff in a red shirt, if you have a sales or marketing question, ask a blue shirt"". I got a charge out of that. Sales people are enamored with what the software can do for you, and the technical staff is enamored in how it can do it.

What I really wanted to share with you is the major difference between W2000 and 98; In W2000 the system files are off bounds by different programs regarding, not being able to modify them for each program. In 98, that doesn't hold true. If a change needs to be made to a system file, then the outside software manufacturer can do it. The only help is that you can run system file checker in 98 to check for modified system files, and correct them.

What W2000 does is amazing. Not only can an outside manufacturer not be able to change system files, if you go in and delete a system file, then exit out of the folder, then go back in, sure enough the system file you just deleted was automatically restored when you exited out of the folder.

Another point I wanted to make; the overwhelming advantage of using W2000 over XP when installing in an older machine is that it is compatible with a lot of the older hardware.

  Here is the problem: You install XP, and up comes a warning that your hardware is not compatible, or needs drivers loaded in order to work. The manufacturers on the other hand, made your older component, whether it is a sound card, or video card, long before XP arrived, so they never created software drivers for it to run in XP. Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components. The advantage with W2000 is that you are getting the reliability, and the older hardware (within reason) compatibility.

 XP is built on the Windows 2000 platform.

I just built a new machine, so I installed XP Pro on it, and I also picked up a copy of W2000 from an independent seller here at Amazon, and loaded it on my AMD K62-500 for the network. Although I did have one video card that didn't have a W2000 driver, so I changed that very inexpensively with a great 128meg video card on sale with rebates for $29. So my old machines that were built in 1999 run W2000 great. No more programs freeze when several programs are open at the same time. You can leave a machine sitting for a couple of hours and not have it respond poorly when you come back to it, and have to reboot. No more blue screen error reports, having to reboot and run scan disk.

On my new XP machine, I had a bad program loaded, and when would run it, I would get a millisecond error screen, with an instant shut down, then it would reboot without having to run scan disk.

Intuit (like many other companies) plays games with licensing and features and versions, which annoy me as much as anyone else, but that doesn't make the product terrible.  BTW, if you have a tax situation that is more complex than you can handle, tax software isn't going to help you figure things out.  You'll either need to educate yourself (books & IRS website), or find a tax accountant.

Initial Review 6 Dec 2015

This is my first report, which I will update down the road after I've made more progress.

Initial download from Amazon and installation was completely trouble-free (Windows 7 64-bit).  No problems with warnings, glitches, updates, or anything else.  The only oddity (minor) was that after the initial updates it failed to automatically start the program, after saying it would.  When I did start it up, it quickly found the various copies of my 2014 tax files (I save versions as I go, in case I make a serious error and need to roll back).  Imports from the file I selected were clean and trouble-free.  My tax situation this year includes self-employment income, investment income, foreign income (not just mutual funds), itemized deductions, college expenses, 529 fund payouts, and Roth conversions.

The interview hasn't changed much that I noticed.  I switched back and forth between the interview and the forms view, as I often do, to understand what was going on under the covers.  It didn't take too long for me to enter all my current numbers (many of them estimates, of course) and get a sense of my full tax picture.  For state taxes, TT had already started on my state return (based on my home state), but asked me to confirm that it was the free state I wanted to use (extra states have additional cost, e.g., if you live and work in different states).  The state tax return was also trouble-free and looked correct.

Two glitches to report so far, hopefully these will be corrected.  Both are related to college costs, and both can cost you real money.
(1) My son's college charges a required fee that it doesn't include in the 1098T.  It's a qualified expense for the 529 fund, and there's a place for it on the form, but TT doesn't ask for it or allow it during the interview.  You sort of have to know the mechanics and go into the right form to add this item.  Not user-friendly, and can lead to higher taxes than you owe.  Bad.
(2) The ""optimization"" of the various education credits is terrible, and can lead to bad results if you let the program do what it chooses.  In my case TT reserved a huge part of the 529 funds withdrawn for the AOC (don't worry if you don't know what that is), which led to some of it becoming taxable.  There was no optimization -- I was able to do much better with simple trial-and-error.  Bad.

One other thing I noticed:  there doesn't appear to be a simple way to find and correct the health insurance figure (in the business income section).  It's hard to find in the interview, and I couldn't find a way to change it in the forms (ran into a circular reference between two forms each saying go change the other one).  This part of the program hasn't changed from last year.  Not a big problem, just something to be aware of.

Overall, I'm satisfied.  Still a reasonable program for the money, still does a decent job at reducing my tax computation and filing hassles.

Update 22 Feb 2016:

Overall I'm still reasonably happy with TT.  Some specific comments:

(1) The college fees issue I mentioned above is still in the software, which I think means that it will ""never"" be corrected.  It's important to enter this data correctly, obviously.  Further, it might affect your state tax as well: in MA, it matters in the computation of the college tuition deduction.

(2) The optimization of the American Opportunity Credit is now corrected, it works the way it should.

(3) I had a problem with the MA tuition deduction calculation works -- in my first run in December this wasn't done correctly by TT, so it over-indicated (by more than $2000) how much I would gain from this.  So now I find that I'm paying the state instead of getting a refund.  Would have been nice to know that before I had to pay my Jan estimated tax installment.

(4) The handling of Form 1116 (for foreign tax credit) is very poorly implemented.  TT prompts you during error checking to fill in some required ""explain this line"" forms, instead of doing so during the interview.  Also, the explanations are usually so simple that TT has the information needed to pre-fill these in, instead of asking the user to hunt down where the numbers came from.  Also, if you're not careful, Form 1116 might calculate your foreign tax credits incorrectly, by excluding certain foreign income.  I've found that one MUST review this form manually and make corrections directly in the form and in the relevant 1099 forms, in order to make sure everything is done correctly.  (I've been doing this for years now, there's been no improvement here.)",TT remains a pretty good tax prep software package,1449360000,56.0,

While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.
The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the ""old computer,"" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).
Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.
Using XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the ""clear type"" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a ""normal"" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).
I'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).

I migrated all my financial data to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iBank-4/dp/B003WT1KAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iBank 4</a>, a far more full-featured and better-supported application. The tipping point was to be told in October 2012 by Intuit not only that there is still no full upgrade to Quicken for Mac 2007, but also that as I'm not a US resident Intuit would not even provide me with the Mac OS X 10.7 Lion-compatible version of Quicken for Mac 2007 from the PowerPC version (16.0.2.- R3) I had been using!

I was a long-term user of Quicken, with 14 years of financial data recorded in it from June 1998 to October 2012.  I had been using both Macs and PCs (Macs preferred) since 1984. I migrated my financial data to Quicken in 1998 from an earlier Mac personal accounting application called Dollars & $ense, from a company called Monogram which went out of business about the same time their product succumbed to the Y2K bug.

Intuit long has had a popular and evidently well-supported financial software range for Windows, but its product development and support for the Mac platform went into terminal decline after 2007. Its support and customer service for Mac users now have degraded to a point of non-existence or uselessness. What totally impenetrable thinking led Intuit to this incredible outcome?  The answer is a mystery. Would Microsoft throw away its market advantage by failing to maintain cross-platform compatibility between Mac and Windows versions of MS Office, or Adobe its cross-platform compatible market dominance in imagery and PDF processing? No way!

When the initially excellent Quicken for Mac 2007 started showing its age, Intuit engaged in some two years of beta-testing and consultation with the Mac-user community.  This was among the largest scale, most hyped beta-testing and consumer consultations ever for any Mac product. It turned out that the long promised, much hyped Quicken Mac upgrade was nothing but vaporware. The only result was a dumbed-down standalone product, so-called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], the exact opposite of everything that the Mac-user community told Intuit we need!  Is it any wonder that we Mac users feel that Intuit has treated us with contempt?

Intuit's failure to build on its market potential with Mac users is a tragedy and farce. I highly recommended Quicken for Mac 2007 in earlier times when it was justly the market leader. Now, sadly, I must strongly recommend that Mac users avoid the product and its makers.

More than seven years now have passed since this last release of Quicken for Mac, in August 2006. Intuit never updated this out-of-date product -- merely patched it two or three times when its bugs and incompatibilities stopped it working in new versions of Mac OS X. Since 2010 Intuit has not even updated its only other personal finance software for Mac, the absurdly named&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], a downgrade of Quicken for Mac which has even fewer essential features than its obsolete predecessor.

What on earth has been going on at Intuit that it has abandoned Mac product development? My best guess is that some totally unrealistic and irrational feedback, typically from a small number of noisy Mac personal finance users, has convinced Intuit that we Mac users are just creative types and airheads with no grasp of the mathematical logic, rational thinking and work discipline required to use full-featured personal financial accounting.

The unreasonableness of some customer negative feedback on personal finance software would be enough to alienate the most helpful software developers. Typically, the noisiest unreasonableless ranges across complaints about non-core, third party functions like bank downloads; blaming software for user error, or the consequences of user failure to read user manuals or to follow simple universal accounting principles. Has this unreasonableness convinced not only Intuit, but also other personal finance software makers, that we Mac users are financial and computer illiterates not worth their time and trouble? Could the impossible-to-satisfy high maintenance demands of financially illiterate customers also explain why even Microsoft never released its former personal finance product, Microsoft Money, for Mac -- and discontinued it for Windows in 2009?

Since migrating from Quicken for Mac 2007 to iBank in 2012, I am now in my third year with iBank. I highly recommend the current version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iBank-5-Download/dp/B00GUXLRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iBank 5 [Download</a>] to all Mac users who are unafraid of the tiny amount of work, rational thinking and user manual reading necessary for serious, accurate personal finance recordkeeping. iBank's makers, IGG Software (with whom I have no association, except as a satisfied paying customer) specialize only in personal finance software for the Mac OS and portable iOS devices, iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.

I have almost 16 years of continuous, detailed, accurate data in iBank. This is the best move I ever made in personal finance recordkeeping -- but the most unrealistic, unreasonable and absurd remarks I ever have seen about personal finance software continue to flow in attacks on iBank. Among the most absurd claims is that either of the two outdated Quicken personal finance products is as good as, or better than, the state-of-the-art iBank software, which has had more feature-rich updates in the past year than both Quicken Mac products in their combined lifetimes. This is not a matter of opinion or taste: it is objective fact about all the long list of capabilities iBank has, which are lacked by the Quicken Mac deficient duo.

In these days of widespread fake review writing, star ratings averaged from total positive or negative reviews in Amazon are less trustworthy than ever for product evaluation. Unfortunately, there is no certain method for distinguishing a merely silly or misinformed review from a fake. Significantly, a much higher proportion of helpful customer votes (far more difficult to fake than reviews) appears in Amazon on substantiated, detailed and factual positive reviews of iBank than on negative reviews and comments. The distribution of helpful votes gives the most accurate picture of what the Amazon customer community really thinks about products. It is unsurprising to find, on this measure, that Amazon customers rate an Intuit product,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], the worst of all personal finance software -- not only for the Mac OS, but for Windows, Unix and *all* operating systems.",Intuit lost the plot after Quicken for Mac 2007 (updated 24Apr2014),1289433600,6.0,

The Outlook itself is quite complex and useful for managing your workflow in a busy environment. If you need a tool to just manage your personal email, there are, probably, less heavy tools.

In 2007 edition Microsoft added a ribbon on the title bar of the message viewer. This ribbon is a customizable bar with buttons.

And I had no issues with installation either. I think the problems people are having must either be user, hardware requirements, or computer settings related. And I do own a previous version of this software, so that could be why I didn't experience any problems or confusion with setup and use. My last version of this software was version 14, and I did find version to be quite a bit faster and better.

Now, while this version has a lot of editing tools, for only a few dollars more you can get Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate. And in my opinion, given it's only a few dollars more, that's certainly the way to go. Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate will allow you to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. And the Ultimate version also gives you more 2D and 3D special effects, the Red Giant Filmmaker's Toolkit, and the Motion Graphics Toolkit. It's well worth the few extra bucks.

Now, while all the improvements to version 17 are really terrific, what makes this new version a winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus is a great set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. You get a lot of bang for your video editing buck. It contains all the tools you need to make really great videos.

Maybe the larger and much more expensive PhotoShop programs do a little more, maybe they are a little easier to use, or maybe the Nay Sayers just hate Canadians.  How would I know?  I don't even own anything from PhotoShop except Elements 7.

I started editing photos using Picasa, the free download from Google.  That was okay then - for my level of expertise.  Later, I improved my results a little by using PhotoShop Elements 7.  It was a lot more difficult to use than Picasa, but the results were worth the extra effort.  Both accepted Canon RAW formats.

Now I'm using Coral Paint Shop Pro Ultimate Photo X2 - and the other smaller programs included for free.  I am amazed that good User Guides, and excellent Video Instructions, are included at no additional charge.  I did purchase a book for Coral's Photo X3, but just to see if it's worth the upgrade to me.  It is.  I'm saving up (or waiting for the price to drop when X4 comes out).

Of course all these new potentials are kind of overwhelming at first.  But I can use just the easy parts or, if inspired by a one of my pictures, I can go to whatever level I'm willing to expend the effort to use.

In ""Message in a Haunted Mansion"" they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasn't horrifying.

Story-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that she's renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.

Graphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.

Sound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.

Gameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.

Length-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.

Overall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.

Jeanclerc,"I had been becoming of the mind that anti-virus software may actually be worse than the viruses and malware themselves.  Most retail offerings are overpriced, difficult to install, and confusing to maintain.  And then the cherry on top is that they typically bog down your computer's performance while letting the bad stuff through anyway.

But PC Tools Internet Security 2009 has turned me around on this topic.  It installed easily on my Windows XP (sp3) workstation after I had removed my prior security suite (begone forever, Norton 360!), including automatically retrieving all of the latest updates.  Registration was as simple as providing the product key and my email address - immensely less obtrusive than the Norton runaround.

The dashboard is easy to read, visually separating its protection against spyware, viruses, spam and intrusion (i.e. firewall) into different portions of the screen.  Globally useful information such as the most recent scan date and how many days are left on your subscription are placed in immediate view - no digging required.  Click any of the protection panes and you get detailed information including helpful links for setting runtime options and viewing historical results.  It's all very user-friendly and intuitive.

PC Tools really shines during routine use.  Aside from the times when it was running an update, the software's footprint was very manageable, both in terms of CPU and memory usage.  So no more slowdowns during browsing.  And it manages to provide this protection without cluttering up your browser with any branded toolbar nonsense - imagine that, Norton!

Its schedule, thresholds and notifications are all simple to customize so that you get the level of protection that you want without going overboard with non-stop messages and warnings.  Their IntelliGuard feature is aimed at ensuring ongoing protection while not overloading the average user with technical minutiae.  Let's face it - the average Internet user doesn't know (or even want to know) hot to properly configure his or her firewall.  IntelliGuard does a good job of doing it for the user, sparing a lot of the confusion which can actually lead to loopholes in security.

Its scans seem to be very thorough - it immediately picked up lots of resident malware and other nonsense that Norton had quietly let live on my PC for who knows how long.  This version also touts a new ""Behavior Guard"" feature that supposedly catches potential threats based on monitoring suspect activity in the OS of your computer.  Put another way, a virus doesn't have to become ""known"" and added to everyone's update list for you to be protected from it.  How well does it work?  Well, that's difficult for the layperson to assess, but I can tell you that a month in, I'm yet to have any virus or malware-related problems and I feel much more confident than I ever did with any other retail suite.  I'll certainly update this review if anything bad happens under PC Tools' watch, however.

The PC Tools Internet Security suite comes bundled with licenses for one year of protection for three computers, so it's also a good value compared to the retail competition.  This software has actually done what none of the other competitors I've tried could do in the past:  changed my mind for the better about anti-virus software.","A Very Solid Performer, both during Install and Day-to-Day",1231977600,,

I can't understand why MS would dumb down their product. Also, the street names seem to have been dumbed down as well. For example, Golden Eagle Ferry Road has been reduced to Ferry Road. There are innumerable examples of this dumbing down and simpifying which only serves to confuse.

The good news: The GPS functionality has been vastly improved with voice and large visual prompts which make using the program in an automobile MUCH MUCH easier. The little car cursor in the 2005 version has been replaced by a much more visible circle with a large arrow in it indicating direction.

Despite the dumbing down of the actual map data the program remains a superb mapping program with many updates since the 2004 and 2005 versions. New streets, restaurants and other points of interest are now incorporated. This program offers a truly affordable GPS guidance system for nearly all consumers without having to go to the expensive Garmin or Magellan systems. If you find yourself traveling to points unknown I cannot imagine a better solution for getting around than this product in conjunction with your notebook.

A few comments about the Streets and Trips mapping software. I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.

One problem I had, and hopefully this will help others who might encounter the same problem: Downloading the software into your computer does NOT automatically load the drivers for the GPS locator device! This must be done separately with the Setup disk when you first attach the locator device. Should you fail to put the Setup disk in and let your computer find the driver automatically ON THAT DISK, then your program will not recognize the locator! I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure out what was wrong. If you don't add the drivers manually your device manager will automatically load drivers that will not be recognized by the program! I had to go into my Device Manager and uninstall the drivers that were added and then manually install the MS drivers for the GPS locator. Not an insurmountable problem, but it does require a bit of experience with computers.

The included driver software turns your USB port into a pseudo-serial communication port enabling the software to recognize the locator (only serial ports are recognized by the software). The software will not recognize the locator UNLESS it is attached to a serial (or in this case pseudo-serial) communications port. So be careful and follow the installation instructions closely. The locator is made by Pharos GPS and if you have any installation problems go to their web site for further instructions.

I have not yet tried the ""bonus"" subscription to Nolo's living trust, but will revise once I've had the opportunity.

Which brings me to a couple of negatives about this product. First, I registered it as instructed, but was then unable to login to retrieve the living trust. This is my fault, because I neglected to record the password. Fortunately, Nolo has the usual capability of resetting your password. Unfortunately, it doesn't work ... or isn't working at the moment. It sends me a reset link, but when I try to use it I'm told that it's expired. Annoying. [This was apparently a temporary glitch; I subsequently received a message with a working link.]

Second, when I ran through the process of installing Willmaker and creating a simple will (with plans to get a bit more baroque later, after I had spent the time to think through some issues), I was running on a PC that had recently upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10. I subsequently did a clean install of Win 10, and now I get a ""This App Can't Run on Your PC"" message. Clearly, it can run on my PC, but I need tech support to help me get it going.

I will revise this review once I've heard back from Quicken/Nolo on these issues and (I hope) given the living trust and its associated resources a try.

General comment on Nolo: There is nothing comparable to Nolo as a source of legal advice and guidance that is accessible to the general public. They have a well-earned reputation as a reliable source of legal information. On the other hand, their online materials are not all you could hope for. Their ""free legal updates"" tend to be very skimpy, and the related blogs (where they advertise them) tend to have a handful of old posts and nothing else.

General comment on Quicken: These guys are not exactly a model company. Customer support for Willmaker Plus 2016 will only last until the end of the year, assuming they give it the same treatment as Willmaker Plus 2015. By insisting that you must buy a new product every year, they are pushing customers away.

Bottom line: If you have a big and/or complicated estate, you should probably turn to your lawyer and your tax adviser instead of a piece of software. If your financial and legal affairs are relatively simple, however, Willmaker Plus could be a good choice for you. Customer support is not marvelous, however, and if you want to revise your will next year and you want it to reflect any relevant changes in the law, you will need to buy next year's version.","Mostly as advertised, but with some warts",1455062400,13.0,

I cannot use Vista because of accessibility problems so I have to use XP.

2008-05-08
The Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3 makes changes to XP that severely affect accessibility for people with some forms of epilepsy. I suspect that Microsoft is partially trying to install some Vista style features ( ripped off from Apple ). In particular, I have seen Apple style ""sliding down"" menu boxes or whatever they are called. As an example, open the ""control panel"" applet. BEFORE, it was accessible, NOW, the elements at the top of the left column ""slide"" down. I had enough bad seizures ( bad in this case means very unpleasant - I can actually feel them in my brain ) that, after experimenting trying to disable this abomination, at had to get away from the computer.

For people like me, my computer is my lifeline. Since Macs are absolutely not accessible, we are stuck with Microsoft Windows XP. Vista is absolutely not accessible, as is Leopard, etc. With Microsoft destroying the minimal accessibility of XP, there is nowhere to go.

IF YOU DECIDE TO INSTALL SP3 - FULLY BACKUP YOUR COMPUTER SO YOU CAN REVERT TO SP2 IF YOU HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. ( I have two notebooks; if I cannot figure out a workaround, then I will never be able to install SP3 )

BTW, I review so that other people like me can find information about products to avoid and so that they can realize that the problems that they are having are common to other people. There is essentially no accessibility any more. It is so bad that it is only a matter of years before we can no longer live in this society due to blinking, flashing, etc.

Workaround:
Control Panel | System | Advanced | Performance - SETTINGS
Unclick EVERYTHING that allows animation, fading, sliding, etc. I am not sure how comprehensive this will be but it helps.

BTW, FULL accessibility demands that the display be totally ""quiet"" as far as any unnecessary motion or blinking. Unnecessary features that make Windows XP inaccessible are, in particular, ""progress bars"", animations for copying files. Microsoft Word has major accessibility problems. The animations associated with spell checking ( the IDIOT animated book icon at the bottom of the screen - every time you type the animations start.

The Ancestry website (which you get 3 months of access to with the software) contains a vast amount of information.  It was fascinating to comb through their records and see census data going back to the 1800s and also seeing the WWI draft papers of my great-grandfathers.  As you enter new family members into the tree, Ancestry looks up information and provides hints and facts for each family member.  Having access to this wealth of information is great and I would give Ancestry 5 stars for the information.  (One note about the information - it seems to mostly be United States records.  I found no information from my ancestors' homelands - mostly Germany and Russia.  I can't speak to whether Ancestry has access to records from other countries though.)

The data an essential part of this program - at least for me since my family did not keep meticulous records of our ancestors.  Without the data, I would have a tiny tree, only going back as far as my great-grandparents.  However, the software that creates the tree is not very user friendly or intuitive.  I found myself getting lost in the tree when going back and forth between the research function and the data entry function.  The software also wasn't intuitive enough on its own to figure out siblings and parents based on the census data.  All of the information would be listed - parents and children, but importing this information often takes several counter-intuitive steps.  Also, I did the DNA ancestry test and although I was able to import it into my family tree, it didn't integrate well.  It's just a fact attached to a family member and can't even easily be seen unless I dig into that person's record.

I was also dismayed that I had to enter credit card information even though this software came with a free trial.  It is set to automatically renew and I will have to remember to cancel it on my own, which is very irritating.  I hate when companies use this sort of marketing tactic.  It really turns me off.

It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.  I highly recommend the product.

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version.  It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document.  Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!
One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.
As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

I think it depends on what type of user you are.

If you want to do some fun, different effects easily to your pictures, honestly, Pixelmator isn't for you.  Yes, it can do a lot of manipulation, but there is a learning curve, and to really make it fly you're going to invest hours in learning all its ins and outs.  Casual users would be better off sticking with online free or low-cost manipulators like [...] (my favorite!).

What if you say you really want to get into advanced photo-manipulation and do all kinds of spectacular stuff?  Well then you might want to invest in something high end like Photoshop or a little lower like Aperture.  If you don't have any money you can get GIMP, which is a very powerful program but a little cumbersome to use, for free.

So Pixelmator is stuck in the middle, between the free, easy, less powerful online programs and the very difficult, very powerful, very expensive programs like Photoshop.

So what changed (other than the unconscionable increase in price)?  Well in 2014 TurboTax suddenly discovered that it had been incorrectly calculating depreciation on foreign rental properties.  Instead of using a 40 year life the software used a 27.5 year life, which only applies to properties located within the US.  This occurred year after year despite the fact that TurboTax explicitly asked if the property was located in a foreign country, to which I always checked the ""Yes"" box.

Because of this flaw all of my tax returns going back to 2005 had incorrectly claimed too much depreciation on my Canadian rental property, thereby requiring me to file a complicated Form 3115 to request a change in accounting convention.  Furthermore, I have to report extra income over the next four years so the IRS can recover the excess depreciation I took.  This, in turn, pushed me into a higher tax category and increased the amounts I will have to pay in Medicare premiums.

Judging from the outcry on the Turbotax user forum, many others were also affected by this incorrect depreciation calculation.  I suspect that thousands of taxpayers were impacted.  So why hasn't anyone filed a class action suit against TurboTax?  Well, if you read the software license, by using the software you give up your right to sue Intuit and must settle your grievance in binding arbitration.  Arbitrators almost always find in favor of the company so why even bother going there.  Furthermore, the fine print in the software license states that Turbotax does not guarantee that the software will produce the right answer so you use it at your own risk.  How convenient - for Intuit.

I have had it with this shoddy company.  I'm switching to the new guy on the block: TaxAct.  It is much cheaper and hopefully more accurate.  If it is not I will switch again - bit not to TurboTax.

It's tough sometimes to review a product like this, because if it works well... and Trend Micro Internet Security Pro does... there is little to notice; no worms, no identity theft, no problem.  Is Trend Micro 100% responsible for those results?  Probably not, as I would like that think that my common sense caution plays some role in my lack of drama.  But I'll give them credit for at least 75% of my success.

Even moderately cautious users will occasionally click on the wrong link, and it's comforting to see Trend Micro step between you and a suspicious web site from time to time.  Note to those that might see this little intervention on a regular basis, you just might want to rethink what you want out of the internet (genuine information and entertainment, or ????).

So, no virus infections within the past year.  No Trojan attacks, and everything appears to be safe and secure.  This is good!

Besides the basics, there are two features that I appreciate most, the System Tuner and the Trend Micro Vault.  My Vista-running PC has always been slow to boot and vulnerable to lags caused by resident software like security programs.  But what good does a security program do for you if it causes everything else to run more slowly? Internet Security Pro 3.0 doesn't create that problem.  And the System Tuner helps you tweak your resident software and file sizes to make that even less a problem.

I've had problems with other security programs in the past (Microsoft, Norton and McAfee), but this has been the most trouble-free package for me by far.  Installation was simple and quick, registration went off without a hitch and my system performance is clearly better.

And what about the System Vault?  Consider it your last-ditch defense.  If someone manages to walk off with your notebook, System Vault won't let them into the files that you least want shared.  'Nuff said.

I installed this on my computer in less than 30 seconds, and after a restart, I had the safe ready to go.

I found it just right.
When I contemplated self-employment, I had several concerns, including whether or not I could actually keep the wolf from the door that way, but my largest was the thought that I would have to keep records of some kind. I don't have a talent for that. When my sixth client sent me a contract, I searched diligently for a book called, say, ""The Smallest Amount of Accounting Knowledge You Need to Avoid Getting Thrown in Jail,"" but didn't find such a thing. All the books I could find seemed to imagine that I was -- well, an accountant.
Office Accounting Professional 2008 doesn't assume this. It is bossy software.
You know what I mean about bossy software. It reminds you to apply payments to invoices and nags you about putting in people's names correctly and won't let you charge people for ""June.""
In general, I don't like bossy software. Bossy word processing programs often just don't understand complex syntax and don't have as large a vocabulary as I do, and I really don't need my computer to warn me that I haven't been properly introduced to websites.
But the bossiness of this software means that someone like me can put her data in correctly enough to send it off to the accountant -- and there is a system for doing that, too.
I scoffed at the set-up poster, by the way, but it was nice to have some large paper showing all the steps in order. I had no trouble getting the software installed, everything was done by wizards, and overall I found the whole package reassuring.

Nero 2014 packs a lot of products into this single collection.  This can make it difficult to find the functionality that you want.  For example I figured I'd try recoding a CD to MP3s to play on my portable player, you'd think ""Nero Recode"" would do this task.  No, it doesn't, ""Recode"" says it doesn't recognize any of the files on the CD.  I managed to find under Nero Express a tab for the ""extended area"" where I found ""Save Audio Tracks"" which does this process.  There is a long hesitation as it loads the dialog box, which I assume is it going out and querying the Internet for the track name data (no option to skip this check).  People who like simplicity might like Nero as it doesn't allow you to get into all the fine details of MP3 settings (you just select from a list of 19 preset options) but people looking for a power tool may be disappointed.

I couldn't find the options menu.  It's not on the main screen that you use most.  I clicked everything, I stopped and restarted the program- how ANNOYING.

At first I was skeptical about what they meant, but after using the program; yes it is a problem. I am going to cover that as well as several other points important to know.

Back up your company files right before loading the new version 2013. It only takes a second, and makes your test drive easily reversible.

You have a choice of jumping off of the diving board by loading the new version of QB 2013 by overwriting the old version, and then converting your existing company files but unconverting them, and restoring them is a major hassle. So the following is important to know.

You can run both versions of QuickBooks (in my case 2010 and 2013) concurrently/at the same time. So you are keeping your old version of QuickBooks intact while you try out the new one. (They currently have a 60 day return policy so take it for a test drive) This is important. When installing it asks you, ""Do you want to overwrite your old version?"" If you want to test it out and not go through the rigamarole of reconverting, or restoring your old version in case you want to send the new version back, say NO by choosing the option above it in order to write it to a new location. They already have a folder designated to do that when you choose that option and it is called ""QuickBooks 2013"". Don't worry about choosing your industry edition; you can always change it later from within QuickBooks. Note: If you install it on more than one computer you must install the same industry edition. This way you can try QuickBooks without over writing your existing version, OR converting your current company files over to the 2013 version either. So play with the sample file, or do as I did if you are creating a new company in addition to the old one. So with both version running and open, if I have an order from a customer from one company I can process it without having to open and close companies to access it. In plain words I have one click access to both companies. So both Qbooks versions are open, and both companies are open at the same time. That is something you cannot do if you only have one version of QuickBooks. You can however have two companies open if you install QB into a laptop also. (They allow you one other install but only if you use the same industry edition. So for example if you have a manufacturing company and a retail business they have different industry editions)

So now onto the three pound monster; the color schemes. In 2012 you had the option of choosing an assortment of color schemes. You don't have that option in 2013. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that they chose colors that create headaches; well at least in some people.  I love the way 2010 looks. It is reminiscent of Outlook 2007 with its soft blues and grays. It is pleasant to look at and easy to read. 2013 has the same icons and choices (how are they going to improve on something in any major way that has been through a zillion years of tweaking to make it Intuit-ive?) BUT they changed it slightly with the biggest problem as I see it (no pun intended) is they included black backgrounds with reversed out white letters. Our eyes get adjusted to that, and then on the same page they have these super soft letters on a bright background which is a seismic shift. I can see what they mean that this could give you a headache after awhile. So I thought I would convert it some by minimizing the left side navigation pane, which is easy to do with one click of the mouse, but the problem is that when you use any one of the features such as invoicing, credit memos, estimates etc up comes those screens with the same black header reversed out and you can't change that.  On a cerebral-vision basis it is not conducive to reducing the workload, but rather increasing it. Your eyes and vision set have to constantly readjust depending on which part of the page you are focusing on.  As soon as you open the program and spend a few minutes with it, you immediate feeling will be how do I change the black headers only to find out you can't. The headers also give you a feeling of the old DOS days; it is real basic and the level of graphics is Neanderthal. The rest of the work area is fine. I don't have any problem with soft lettering, or the nicely colored icons; just change the headers, and/or include some color scheme changes.
What else is there?

I have been using Intuit products since the DOS days in the 80's. Easy to use, intuitive, and great for small businesses. There is no way they are not going to fix this. There are too many people complaining about it. It will have a devastating effect on sales. Intuit is the best and I am sure they will be updating by re-creating the color scheme choice like they had in 2012, or at the very least go back to the pleasant default color scheme in some earlier versions. If they don't hold onto your 2012 version because they are going to become more and more valuable especially if Intuit stops making the 2012 version.

UPDATE: Okay I am going to have to tip my hat because Intuit did ""correct"" the problem. Why do I put quotes around correct? I don't want to nit pick but I have to be critical. What they did with R6 free update (R9 is out now) is ""Company File Color Scheme"" option is introduced in the ""Desktop View"" preference to allow users to change the color of the title bar and the border of QuickBooks windows for a particular company file, which will help users to differentiate between multiple company files. This preference will be replacing the ""Company Color Flag"" preference introduced in R4 release. We are offering 14 different ""Company File Color Scheme"" options to apply on various company files. This is a user level preference, which essentially means that various users connected to the same company file can select different colors. (R6)

That was a copy and paste from Intuit of the improvement. What it means is that the title bars have been made adjustable into some really nice colors. My main concern was how the large black background area with white text was creating an eye set, if I can use that expression which was pretty bold, and then you had to re-adjust your eyes in order to see the fine print in lighted out gray in the forms etc. So it was a headache waiting to happen. At first I dismissed others comments but then saw exactly what they were saying, and had to agree with them. So what did Intuit do? They did not get rid of the large black background to the main menu on the left, BUT you can minimize that so it is a small border on the left side of the screen. Then they gave you this option to change the title bar color options with some beautiful colors, while at the same time changing the title bar titles themselves into all caps to help balance the visibility out. All in all it is very useable now.

In all fairness in my 2010 version the invoices for example have black backgrounds with white letters in the inner title bars but the black bars are a lot thinner. 2013 has large black bars still. BUT with the other changes it is very manageable, and I would now have to say that I give the whole program a triple thumbs up and 5 stars. I also must admit that the left main menu is easier to read with a black background and white letters, rather than a lesser contrast option so they did good. The fact that you can minimize that whole window, and then you are working almost exclusively in your color choice (and the ones they give you are beautiful) makes this a top drawer program. I am once again in love with Quickbooks, yes even the 2013 version.","They Fixed the Color Scheme, See my Update, Where Else are You Going to Go?",1352592000,47.0,

I have to tell you, all the professional reviews I read were very high on Office 2016 for Mac, but all the user reviews on Amazon and elsewhere painted a completely different picture. I went into my evaluation of Office Home and Business 2016 for Mac with huge reservations, but after about a week, I'm beginning to think that Microsoft may have resolved many of the issues that that existed at launch.

I'm using an old MacBook Air (mid 2012) with just 4GB of RAM and the Office installation did not suddenly bog my system down, nor have I had problems actually running Office. Every piece of the suite--Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook--runs smoothly on my Mac. And they look so much better than Office 2011. One bummer I didn't know about in advance was that Outlook 2016 for Mac only supports Exchange Server 2012 and above and my company hasn't yet upgraded to the newer Exchange server. I'm not sure why this limitation exists for the Mac, because the Windows version works fine with the older Exchange server.

I also want to mention that I researched the licensing and from what I've read, you can install this version more than once, but it can only be running on one computer at a time. If you happen to get a new computer or you reinstall the OS, you're allowed to install it again. The caveat is that you must uninstall it from everywhere else and you can only do this once every 90 days. Also keep in mind that this version does not allow you to install Office on your iPad or iPhone. Those licenses only come with a subscription to Office 365.",Looks so much better than 2011 and performs just fine on my MacBook Air,1463788800,,
3160,8098,8098,4.0,True,"12 15, 2016",A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,B00EZKNYXG,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},PhotoGraphics,"If you're reading this you probably have already searched a variety of tech sources for the best antivirus software and, like me, consistently found Webroot near or at the top of the list. Buying antivirus software is one of the most dreaded computer-related task most people face  just reading the daily headlines reinforces that computer hacking is real and proper protection is necessary.  You want to make the right choice in buying antivirus software but there seem to be so many negative horror stories about antivirus software.  Heres why I ended up with Webroot.

The first thing I want to share is that I have been buying antivirus software for over 20 years, for business and home, and I am not married to any one brand. In fact, over time, I have bought and used nearly every brand sold.  And yes, some of them were true horror stories.

When WIN 10 came along I made the decision not to add any third-party protection at all to what is already part of the WIN 10 suite (Windows Defender).  While most independent experts agree that Defender isn't the best solution out there, they also agree that it is good enough for most people who use their computer for casual everyday use.  Defender has the huge benefit that it has almost no negative impact on computer speed or performance and it works totally in the background and never nags or bugs you (unless there is a reason to alert you to a problem). Another major benefit of Defender is that is updates itself (in the background) so you are always assured of being protected against the latest threats.

IF you want to add more protection to your computer but you like the positive benefits of Defender, Webroot is one of the best options out there.

SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. Unlike most software there isn't really an old or new version of Webroot.  As long as you are running one that is compatible with your computers operating system Webroot works like Defender in that it is really merely an interface to their online services where all the actual smarts are located.  That is why Webroot won't work unless you are online.  You don't have to worry about updating to a new version each year or doing periodic downloads because (as Webroot calls it) it is always up to date.

2. Because Webroot doesnt install a large number of files directly on to your computer, it utilizes very little of your computers resources, thus most people will probably never notice any difference in computer speed or performance.

3. When the term of your license runs out you don't have to buy a new disc and reinstall the program. Buying a new license just allows the software to continue to run for another year (or whatever the term of your license is).  There is good news and bad news in that. The makers of Webroot don't seem to have figured out how to reward existing customers who want to renew their license. Instead, when their offer is sent to you as your license is about to expire their special price is ridiculously high. I mean all they're doing is giving you permission to use their software for another year, you would think they would/could offer you a special price for you loyalty, but no.  Which forces people like me to simply buy a whole new disc from whoever has it on sale for the best price at the time. Fortunately my renewal time is around Black Friday each year and I am able to buy a whole new disc for peanuts.

4. People who review Webroot usually have mostly positive things to say (except for the license renewal issue discussed above) but too many of them mention how Webroot has a nag box that appears on your screen every time you turn your computer on. Not true, or at least not fully true.  Yes that will happen, but all you have to do is uncheck that feature in the advanced settings box and you will never see any messages from Webroot unless you have an intrusion alert (or your license is about to expire).  The fact that Webroot doesnt have nag boxes is one of the major reasons I prefer it over Brands X, Y and Z.

5. When you first install Webroot it does a quick scan and tells you your computer is safe. Dont believe it. The FIRST thing you should do is force a deep scan. Webroot makes doing that harder to find than most of their competitors. To do a deep scan, open you file manager (the screen that shows you your hard drives) and right-click on each available drive, starting with your boot drive (usually your C drive) and choose Scan with Webroot.  Then sit back, the deep scan will take a long time, depending on how full your drive is and how fast it accesses files it can take up to a couple of hours.  There will be a dialogue box with a progress bar, how many threats were detected, elapsed time, etc.  Its best not to do anything else (multitask) at the same time until the scan is completed.

BOTTOM LINE

This is the third consecutive year Ive made the conscious decision to choose Webroot over other brands of antivirus software.  In that time Ive never had a virus infect my computers, Ive never noticed a slowdown of my computers performance, Ive never been annoyed by needless advertising popups, and Ive been able to protect 3 devices for a full year for about five-cents a day.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the new offering and some of the key upgrades that are now available; with one minor drawback. For positioning sake let me state first that I'm reviewing the product from a business users standpoint however, all of the key upgrades are advantageous to the home and student user as well.

Overall Thoughts

The Microsoft Office team did a great job of reconfiguring the Office 2010 menu/""ribbon"" feature that was introduced with Office 2007. The new ribbon is easier to customize and reduces the need to flip back and forth due to key functions being buried in the ribbon.
Power Point 2010

For a very long time the one thing that has been missing is the ability to embed video into a slide. Well they finally did it! You can embed video into your presentation if you would like. The thing that makes it a five star feature is that Microsoft has added the ability to edit the embedded video inside of the power point slide with no additional software needed. It's not a professional class video editing software package but it will get the job done and it is intuitive to use.

Another great feature of Power Point 2010 is the addition of a broadcast feature. You can now ""broadcast"" a presentation to people even if they do not have a copy of Office installed. All they need is a compatible web browser: Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox. This feature helps out tremendously with cross-platform compatibility issues.

Excel 2010

I use a lot of graphs in my job and the one thing I hated about Office 2007 was how difficult the ribbon system made making a chart with any customization, such as, layering two sets of data with two different vertical axis's. It was so difficult that it just flat stunk and made me long for Excel 2003. Excel 2010 makes that much easier, not perfect, but easier.

The most significant improvement is the addition of ""Spark"" lines. These are small ""micro"" graphs that are contained in a single cell. Each line of data can have its own micrograph and executive summary, very nice feature.

Outlook 2010

The look and feel of Outlook 2010 is more modern and less cluttered than its Office 2007 counter part. The absolute best feature that was added to Outlook 2010 is the preview feature for appointment/meeting requests. The new feature embeds a slice of your calendar into any meeting request and allows you to scroll through your calendar on the requested day and time to see if you wish to accept. No more switch from view to view in order to determine your availability. This has been a huge time saver.

OneNote

Office 2010 now comes standard with OneNote. I have used this product since its initial beta testing and it has become a mainstay for collecting data from meetings and customer research. The must have software group that has been missing for a while.

The one missing piece

I've been using Microsoft's Business Contact Manager for a few years now and I was very disappointed to see that it was not part of the disk version of Office 2010 Pro. In fact, in talking with friends that still work in IT they can't even figure out how to download or get the application off of Microsoft's site. This is after Microsoft made such a big deal out of the new features and how ""customizable"" the application was for the 2010 release. BCM is a great way for companies or entrepreneurs to have CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tools without spending a fortune on one of the enterprise packages such as [...] or Siebel. It's a big miss for the Office team.

For those that have been putting off upgrading because the value position from 2003 to 2007 was light; now is the time. You will get a much better product with 2010 when compared to Office 2003 or Office 2007.",Someone at Microsoft Must Have Been Listening,1284595200,,

I prefer Trend Micro over all of the others because of the speed of installation, the ease of using the software, and the ease of uninstalling, if necessary. For me, it runs quicker than the other internet security/total security packages.  But I don't use Trend Micro exclusively. I like to sample different security packages to see improvements companies make in their products.  Kaspersky works second best for me.

I have tried other alternatives, and they just don't work the way I would expect them to. Having used Microsoft Office for the PC in the past for all of my office needs, I could not find anything that worked quite the same on my Mac. Printing would be off, or text would not look right, and just a lot of small things that made me feel that I needed to keep looking for the right program to edit spreadsheets and documents on my Mac.

Behold: Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac! This is the newest version of Office for the mac! The settings and options I am used to having are all there! Commands have the same name I am familiar with! Documents and text look the way I would expect them to when I create/edit them and even when I print them! I felt at home!

The menu system does take a bit of getting used to. Instead of being a traditional Menu Bar like Office 2003 (what I am familiar with) it has a style more like Office 2007 - but with the menus detached from the main document window. This takes a little getting used to, but actually is much better with my wide screen monitor. I still prefer the old Office 2003 style menus, but I would say these are a bit more useful then the ones present in Office 2007. Also, the update system can be annoying if you set it to always check for updates. I get a pop-up window every time, but would have preferred if it checked in the background and then just let me know when new updates were available.

Installation took a bit. Not too terribly slow, but it was a bit time consuming. All of this was well worth it though, as any Office program I run starts up very fast! I was impressed with the loading speeds. I expected fairly fast loading due to the major efforts put into the new Microsoft products to decrease loading times, but I still expected it to take a bit longer. Word or Excel load about as fast as Firefox or any other lean program! MUCH faster than an alternative I had been using previously.

After using alternatives, and having become accustomed to the PC version - I found Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac to be a wonderful and necessary software suite for all of my document needs. I would definitely recommend this program if you want a solid and fully featured Office program for your Mac!","Finally, an Update! WooHoo!",1253750400,,

Since I bought this product Intuit has discontinued development of Quicken. They are supposed to sell it to some other vendor. I've never seen a software sale of this magnitude work. For that reason alone this would be a two star rather than three star purchase.

What takes it down to 1 star is that today I'm getting Quicken emails about spending patterns. I did not (knowingly) enable online access to my accounts.

Don't use this product.

--------
The market for personal finance software is not what it was 15 years ago. It is now a niche market. (The reason why that happened is beyond the scope of an Amazon review.)

I am sure nobody would develop Quicken for Windows (the gold standard) today. It's development was funded in a different era, including the painful process of establishing connections to banks. So we can't compare a new product (Quicken for Mac 2015) to that product. If you want all those features you need to run windows in a Mac VM or do dual boot.

So we compare this product to using a spreadsheet (ugh) or iBank 5. Unfortunately that's a very hard comparison to make. I mentioned this was a niche market -- I've not seen any serious head-to-head comparisons from a trusted source.

I opted for this product assuming it leveraged the bank connectivity network funded by Quicken for Windows. It does indeed do that.

It is not a stellar product. It desperately, desperately, needs a manual -- but the finance market is now so small that even niche ePublishers won't write a guide for it. Installation and configuration was quirky. Manual setup of 529 and other non-integrated investment tools is weird. I ran into several UI bugs and usability issues.

There's no Help file.

On the other hand, after initial setup it's bringing data in from a variety of investment sources and multiple US bank accounts. That's something.

It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.

There are a number of variants of this Office suite that can be found for sale here, but this review is specifically focused on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Professional-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPL2K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Professional 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version. This version is activated from the Internet by entering a product key card, and is licensed for one user on one PC. It offers the current versions of Microsoft's Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access, and Publisher applications.

Please note: I had previously installed the more basic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. This Office Professional 2013 version was for installation on a PC that had been upgraded to Windows 8.1, so it was initially more of an experiment than anything. Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office Professional 2013 suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.

 Likes:

+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless
+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed
+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email
+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed
+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way

 Rants & Irritants:

- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat

 Installation:

The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.

Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher or the other components, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.

What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.

 SkyDrive:

I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office Professional and the other Office 2013 variants, and it has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.

 Word:

The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.

Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.

 Excel:

On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.

But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, and restoring the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.

 OneNote:

This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.

 PowerPoint:

There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.

 Outlook:

There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible, and it seems to be working.

 Publisher:

I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office Professional, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.

 Access:

The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have only accessed this module a few times for conversion of some older files... and pardon the pun.

 Annoyances & Irritants:

My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the ""new"" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.

 Suggestions:

Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. This version was for installation on a PC that had recently been upgraded to Windows 8.1, and my installation went smoothly. It works well, though your results may differ from mine.

More than once Ive heard people say that its one of the best (if not the best) titles in the series. But it also has a reputation for being fairly scary and having very complicated puzzles. I guess it was that reputation that turned me off to this game, but I finally ended up buying it because I felt like I couldn't call myself a true Nancy Drew fan without having played Curse of Blackmoor Manor. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.

Like I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.

CHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.

SETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.

PUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There weren't really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.

IS IT CHALLENGING? Absolutely. There was no way I could have figured out some of those puzzles without a walkthrough. 4.5/5

ENDING - 4/5: The ending was good, but not as strong as the other aspects of the game. The reveal at the end and the appearance of the culprit was kind of abrupt and a little underwhelming. The culprits motives made sense but I didn't really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.

Yes, as you can read in other reviews here, this new Mac version can't touch the PC version on a feature-for-feature basis. The PC version is so much more mature, has so many more options and value-added services (not to mention complete payroll management, if you need that), whereas the Mac version is just coming out of the starting gate.

BUT, if you're running a Mac and don't want to bother with a PC, or with running Windows on your Mac just to run QuickBooks, and if you don't need to manage payroll or use some of the other advanced features, then you can feel comfortable with buying QuickBooks as an entry-level solution for a small business. Really, it's not that bad! It's just simple, and contains only a small subset of the features you get on the Windows version.

You can set up income and expense accounts, you can set up invoices and sales receipts, you can track your various bank and credit accounts, and much more. The Amazon product description gives you lots of detail, as does the Intuit website for QuickBooks, so I'm not going to repeat all the features here.

Bottom line: yes, Mac users can do simple accounting for small business with this version, and it's not as full-featured as the Windows version. Let's hope Intuit takes this software seriously, realizes more and more small business owners are using Macs (they must realize it or they wouldn't have backed out of their non-Mac mindset after all these years), and then adds more of the features that make this software a mainstay of small businesses who like running Windows PCs.",Good simple tool for basic business accounting on your Mac,1321920000,,

My youngest daughter was in a ballet recital but a few days before the recital she fell and cut open her head.  That left a nasty wound that the ballet instructor asked us to cover with a minimal band aid.  Needless to say, we could not find a band aid so we tried to brush her hair to the side to cover.  It worked a little but in all the pictures this larger than life cut showed up very prominent.

It just so happened that the software arrived the day before so I loaded it onto my MacBook Pro and without reading through the instructions started playing with the program to see what it could do.  It was very easy to load and I was up and running in about 10 minutes after registering.  I loaded in my pictures and began to work with them, consulting the 114 page user's guide as I was going through the pictures.

After two bad starts I figured out which aspect of the program fixed images and wiped away blemishes and such.  In about 5 minutes I had figured out how to remove the wound from the image and place exact skin tone right over the spot.  I touched it up with a brush feature and then went about brightening their eyes and whitening their teeth, both of which were very easy to figure out without using the guide.

The final product was fantastic and my wife an I can't be more pleased and out daughter loved looking at her image without the cut.  For a program to load, be up and running and finish in less than 30 minutes is wonderful.  The smart patch is what I used along with the eye fix and teeth whitening.

For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
But I have been using Norton Antivirus for several years, and McAfee's online ratings aren't much better, so -- I purchased this product online.  There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted (Norton Internet Security Professional) and also the standard (non-Pro) version I didn't want.  The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the ""download warranty"" that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.  I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I didn't want and went to the next page, where I expected to see only what I wanted, and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final.  But no, I was charged for all four products, including the two that aren't products at all.
The run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL, and apparently the download warranties CAN'T be refunded.  I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?  If so, what about all that support they're promising, if they go down?
Next issue: within a few minutes of installing the software, Norton blocked and reported an attempted access from the Internet, called ""Default Block NetBus Trojan Horse"".  Great, that's what I was hoping to prevent.  BUT: what was that all about?  How do I know who was doing it and who do I tell, in order to get somebody put in jail?

I am no expert in designing or programing of computers, but I have a ton of experience using computers. In today's world, you should not even think about going online without protection from viruses, or being hacked.

I am a long time user of Trend Micro's line of products, and have had nothing but the best results using their virus protection, and firewall to protect me from all threats while being online.

When Trend Micro brought out this newest version of their program, I jumped right on it. I didn't feel a need to research the product, since I trusted the company 100%. As soon as I installed this program, I regretted doing so.

First of all, it has no firewall protection at all. The company says that their program ""enhances"" the firewall available with the Windows operating system, yet refuses to give details of just how it does this. Also, many users are having trouble with lost files, and getting the program to allow known websites to be recognized as friendly.

Basically this program is a dumbed-down version of their software, giving the user less protection, and next to no control of how the program functions.

After I decided I didn't want this junk protecting me, I attempted to roll back to the older version of the program. It was a 3 hour ordeal trying to get the software to uninstall. Windows' uninstall program could not get rid of it. Next, I tried to download an uninstall tool directly from Trend Micro, but that didn't work either. I had to purchase a copy of the older version of the program, right here on Amazon, since Trend Micro didn't offer it on their site. That copy had a ""Forced Uninstall"" tool on the CD, which finally cleaned this newer version off my computer.

Bottom line: Stay away.....very far away, from this program. If you want the best program, from my experience, go with Trend Micro's ""Internet Security Pro"" program. It's from the same company, but is a top notch program. You can get the program right here on Amazon, at a great price.","1 star, because there is no choice for zero stars!",1297814400,,

The first release of Vista probably deserved some of the criticism, but so did those who tried to install it on older machines that just weren't up to the task. Microsoft probably set expectations a little too high, and as what happened with the first Star Wars prequel, the end product was never going to live up to the expectations.

I did not have any experience with Vista until after the release of SP1, so I might have been spared some ugliness that came out of the gates. Since this review is for the SP1 version, I can safely say that you won't experience the pain and agony that was felt by some of those early adopters, IF you install it on decent hardware.

Don't install a current operating system on hardware that was made years before the release of the operating system. Don't install an OS like Vista on a machine that is choked for RAM or hard drive space.

The box says that it recommends a 1 GHz or faster processor, but I wouldn't install it on anything slower than a 3 GHz Pentium 4. It also says that 1GB of RAM is fine. I would say that's a minimum, and anyone doing multiple tasks should be looking at 2GB as a minimum. (You'll need to get the 64-bit version to use anything past 3GB)

Lastly, don't install this OS on a system drive that has meager transfer rates. Something with a minimum average of 50MB/s will probably do just fine, but the faster the better, of course.

You can't buy a Porsche, put no name tires on it, and fill it with 85 octane gas, and expect decent performance. Likewise, don't install a newer operating system on hardware that is years behind the OS in technology. XP is a great OS for older machines. It will run on a P3-450 with a half GB of RAM without any trouble (so long as you're not installing the latest and greatest software that expects more recent hardware).

The bottom line is to use the right tool for the job. Vista SP1 on a decent machine that was new at the time Vista was released is not going to present issues.

This version of Sage 50 (formerly Peachtree Accounting software) is their easiest to use yet with the best interface they have ever offered.

Some background: In case you don't know, Peachtree/Sage 50 has been the 2nd place accounting software for quite sometime now.  It has always been more complete than Quickbooks but not as easy to use nor as ""linked/connected"" to other items. In the old days if you showed 10 normal small business owners both products, after 5 minutes of playing around with both 9 out of 10 would select Quickbooks. (And normally that last person would have had more of an accounting background so easy to use wasn't as important.)

Quickbooks figured this out and started charging more, creating products that would basically expire and selling features that should be included for extra. Peachtree/Sage 50 kept on chugging away and enjoying their 10% until Sage decided to really work on ease of use and the clunky interface. Ever since then, Sage 50 has been slowing gaining customers and converting Quickbooks users. I love it when the underdog starts giving the pretty boy a run for his money!

Sadly, for me, I am still a Quickbooks user. Why you ask? Two reasons Costco and Quickbooks online. While it is now more expensive, for a while you could sign up for Quickbooks Online (which also includes automatic payroll functions) for $6.99 per month. To this date, that is what we still use because it is cheaper than purchasing payroll functions for Sage 50 or Quickbooks and our business needs are very simple. It is also hard to compete with the ability to pull up our account from any computer to work on payroll.

While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.

I can also tell you, however, that Premier probably isn't worth it for the vast majority of people, even if they have investments. The basic version will still allow you to fill out capital gains sheets. The only thing this really gives you is the ability to better handle rental property and gives you tools to value and maximize deductions. If you have a home business that doesn't have employees (and thus no payroll taxes) you can also get by with Deluxe, instead of Home Business. They don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with Premier and Home Business. It's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. They can't actually remove the ability for you to file your required personal taxes and so all versions have all the forms available. The main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.

My recommendation is that you save some money and start with Deluxe or Basic. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done.

OpenOffice not doing a good enough job for what you need? Are you put off by Office 2013, which doesn't offer three product keys for your trouble? Are you even more put off with Microsoft turning Office into Software as a Service with Office 365?

Well, you're going to have to accept some compromises, namely the hated Ribbon and not having all the Office apps. But there are Z number of people who have late Windows XP/early Windows Vista era PCs that are perfect for secondary production running Windows 7 from a retail upgrade disk-and when you do the clean install upgrade for Windows, which you will eventually have to do due to Windows rot, you are going to need Office and you may never get up the budget to where you want to invest in Office 2010 or later for such a low-end often barely Aero-capable PC, so this is perfect as long as you temper your expectations.

With properly set expectations and a legal copy of Office 2007 Home and Student, you can now get down to how it works.

It works by running basic Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote tasks  It's not going to wow you like a new version of Office, but a common thread I've read in hundreds of reviews for various versions and editions of Office is why do they break what works in the previous version when they release a new version? Well, by buying an older version, there are no surprises as regards what Office can and can't do, because it's been around for however many years it's been since the date the version in question (Office 2007 Home and Student, which is 7 years as of when I write this) was made.

What can it actually do? Well, Word's fully featured (as long as you're using it for home or student use.) Excel is fully featured as regards the base program (again, the same caveat applies.) PowerPoint will get your presentations done, although you'll miss some of the customizations of later versions. OneNote is fully featured, and it along with PowerPoint have the caveat that they're for home or student use. The only thing that really lacks in Home and Student versus let's say Ultimate (which I use for troubleshooting through over-engineering), is the Microsoft Office Tools-you can't expect fancy things like Business Contact Manager and the accompanying copy of SQL Server 2005 Express.

In case you're wondering, I'm reviewing this for my aunt and uncle, who sat there and bought a PC in May of 2009 and thanks to a certain ability I have to troubleshoot combined with them buying retail Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade through the Best Buy fulfillment of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option that was current at the time along with retail Office 2007 Home and Student that they beat out of HP's customer (dis)service-albeit with having to pay for it, I get to (and thoroughly enjoy) troubleshooting their PC whenever it is having an issue because I'm on a mission to keep them off of the crack Windows that is Windows 8/RT/8.1/RT 8.1/Windows Phone 8X/Windows Phone 8.1x and I thoroughly enjoy every time I can fix their PC that uses this software.

Office 2007 Home and Student was a change for them at first from the WordPerfect Office suite they were using on their old XP computer, a Dell Dimension 2400 (They replaced it with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 7750+ 4GB RAM 500GB HD HP Pavilion Slimline S5120Y. But then again so was Vista and then 7-they didn't have too much trouble with Vista, but Windows 7 Home Premium combined with this version of Office makes them able to do everything they would ever want to do with Office and a PC. When that changes, they will upgrade-and so far it's not changing.

I just think that Office 2007 (whether lowly Home and Student or mighty Ultimate or something in between like Professional) didn't deserve the reputation it got as regards the Ribbon. People were (and some still are) so angry about the Ribbon that they don't like Office because of the Ribbon. I know I am not as qualified as some people to speak due to my aversion to command line interfaces, whether of the old school DOS/Unix variety or whether of the newfangled Windows PowerShell variety, but I know this for a fact:

Once I properly configured their PC with Windows 7 Home Premium Retail Upgrade on a clean install and reimported their programs, files, and settings, they were using it productively as could be until a virus hit that forced them to pay someone way too much to repair their computer. I was able to set it right and from the moment I first showed them how to do basic things like bold, underline, italics, margins, indentation, in other words showed them where Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student put the tools they were using in WordPerfect Office, they've been happily using Office with the Ribbon.

I hate to discount those who have had negative experiences with Office 2007, because I don't like most change-especially not the licensing restrictions growing ever tighter since 2000, but I haven't had any problems with the Ribbon either.

So with the Ribbon discounted for us and our family, we can now move on to infinitely more pressing matters. Which is how does Office (specifically 2007 Home and Student) perform in real world tasks? Well, it doesn't make you have to renew the usage rights to it every year, it supports the .docx/.xlsx/.pptx trio, and it has a user interface that aside from being different is actually usable (if you can figure out what each button on each section of the ribbon is for, which ToolTips really help with that and they're on by default).

In summation, for the reasons outlined above, Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student is worth the money if you can get a legal copy. I recommend it as long as it's needs match up well with what you need out of (specifically Microsoft) Office,

Take this as you will, 2 families' experiences with Office 2007, one Ultimate, one Home and Student, which is positive and we continue to use Office 2007 to this day.","It's maybe behind the curve, but you can still do a lot with it.",1391817600,,

If you have a Pentium 4 and have this OS it is really a good combination. If you have a Pentium through Pentium III you really might want to think about XP because it does make it run a little bit faster. I love the applications this version has. I can just scroll through all the screens and everything is right there! If you buy 2000 Professional Edition you should get the Microsoft Office 2000 Professional Edition also. Microsoft is a very nice company and I think Bill Gates is the man. Microsoft just went wrong with the XP but that is the only Microsoft OS I dislike. I might be trying to convert to Apple but I am still going to keep Microsoft computers. If you were born and raised on Microsoft it isn't too hard to run it! People keep on saying Mac OS (earlier than X) was easier to operate than 95-2000 versions but for real life most people in the U.S. and other countries have Microsoft.

Until Microsoft decides to natively decode blue ray through Windows Media Center (or whatever replaces it in Windows 8), you need a separate piece of software like this one.

For reference, I have an HTPC with a dual core 2.4ghz processor, 8gb of ram, and a blue-ray player connected to my plat panel TV.

PowerDVD is par for the course these days--sloppy, poorly coded garbage full of unnecessary bloat, with no option to install only the components you want or need. It reminds me of the way NERO went from a streamlined, easy to use program to a boat-fest resource hog. I also dislike how (as other reviewers noted) PowerDVD installs services that work in the background, sending your private data to corporations. Unless you manually stop them, they will track everything you watch and send that data off to marketing companies.

I didn't have any issues installing the software. Things went smoothly, and I was able to easily play a DVD. However, I elected NOT to keep this software on my computer, largely because a much easier solution exists for me. (I don't need it to play anything but Blue-Rays; I use XBMC for playing all my other media). An easy, frustration free way to play Blue Rays is with VLC (a free, excellent media player). Just use it to make .MKV files from each Blue Ray disk and then play them with VLC. For complete instructions, check the comments section of this review.

Basically, this is an overpriced, largely problematic software that you don't really need unless you just have to play Blue-Rays and don't want to mess around with VLC to rip them to .MKV files. I don't see a benefit to buying it unless you are willing to put up with frustration, turn off services sending away your private data, and don't have another option for a media suite.",Plays Blue Rays | Bloated | Ultimately not worth the price,1339632000,,

Software companies often do the same thing.  In this case the most stripped down version is known as ""Deluxe"".  ""Deluxe"" is defined to mean ""luxurious or sumptuous; of a superior kind"" and yet that's the exact opposite of what you get when you buy the ""Deluxe"" product (just like when you buy a ""large"" pizza, you are really getting the exact opposite--a small pizza).  The next version up is ""Ultra"" (that's the one I have) which means ""extreme"", ""at the edge"", or even ""beyond"", when in fact it is a mid-level product.  Then you have ""Ultimate"", ""Ultimate Suite"", and finally ""Director Suite"".  Having this many versions is bad enough, but the naming is downright confusing and drives me nuts... to the point that I'm going to have to remove a star.  Sorry guys.  Now cut it out.

<pauses for a breath... trying to find a happy place... sigh...>

As for the software itself, I have used PowerDirector 12 for a while now and have appreciated it's user interface and feature set.  A year or two ago, I was working on what appeared to be a very simple project--I imported a movie I had gotten online (legally downloaded, I'll have you know) and was trying to edit it for time so a co-worker could use it in a presentation.  The effects were all very simple: fade in/fade out, etc. but even though I spent a couple of hours with various video editing programs, I could not get it to work for me.  As I recall, Adobe Premier Pro CS5 couldn't understand the input file format so first I converted it with an AVS4You program.  Then I had it all edited the way I wanted, but Premier had a zillion and fifty output format settings and I couldn't seem to find the magical combination that would work on my co-worker's Mac and still be a reasonable size (either the file was HUGE, the quality was TERRIBLE, or it just wouldn't work on the Mac).  Next I switched to Pinnacle Studio 14, but it had issues, too--I don't remember what they were, but it was obvious that Pinnacle was a no-go.  Finally I tried PowerDirector.  It was more or less the first time I had used the program, and yet in under an hour, I had a fully rendered video that was a good quality, reasonable file size AND it played on my Windows PC and my co-worker's Mac.

As a side note, I'm pretty sure that Premier Pro can do all the things I've used PowerDirector for, but the darn program has such a learning curve that I often spend a good deal of time just trying to figure out how to do something as simple as fading from one clip to another.  Oh, sure--once you know how to do it, it's easy and once you have been working with the program for a long time, you'll probably find features much faster, but for a novice like myself, it's usually just a frustration.  PowerDirector, on the other hand, has an interface that to me is very intuitive.

You can go to Cyberlink's web site to view all the new features in 13 from 12, but in my opinion, the most noteworthy change is the addition of 2 new formats, XAVC-S and H.265/HEVC.  As noted previously, I'm no video editing expert and I don't use these programs often, but from what I can tell, the look and feel has not changed in any significant way.

If you are reading reviews trying to figure out which video editing program you want to get, I would highly recommend one of the flavors of PowerDirector.

Right now, though, it is the faster and most fabulous Windows OS I have ever used, except it doesn't have Word for free like the Vista on my Dell laptop.

Okay, I'm reviewing the free download from Microsoft, which anyone can get for any device with home versions of Windows 7 or 8 on it.  Months ago, I reserved Windows 10 for my Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 7.  After reserving it, my Toshiba started having problems, especially on start up.  It could take me sometimes 10 minutes to get online! Firefox froze constantly, Chrome was only slightly better, and IE would hardly ever work at all.  I suspected the problems were due to Windows 10 either being downloaded or tested out on my laptop in the background. At one point, I even stopped the automatic Windows Updates so I could see what was being installed.  Unfortunately, I forgot I stopped automatically updating and when I went to Windows Updates this week, saw that I had countless critical updates.  I also had only one choice to choose--Install Windows 10.  They didn't even send me a notice it was my time to do so, after I had been waiting for the notice for months.

Well, I hit the install button, left my laptop plugged in and went about my day.  When I came home and checked the download in the late afternoon, it said it had failed.  The error code suggested the laptop lost connection to the internet.  Thus, I started again and the download amount immediately went to 49% . . . but then it went down to 0%.  I then decided to try to do individual installation of all the critical updates for Windows 7, pushed cancel, and discovered I no longer could view the individual updates.  My only choice was to choose installing Windows 10 again, which I did, and my download amount immediately became 90%.  It then quickly went to 100%, the installation started and finished in no time, and I, at long last, had Windows 10.

It started off with some settings questions that seemed like nothing but spying to me, so I chose ""off"" for all of them.  That didn't seem to slow down Windows 10 at all or mess it up or whatever.  Now, when I go online, I'm online in usually 60 seconds or so.  Firefox, Chrome and Windows Edge, which replaced IE, are all working well.  I can go from one browser to another with no problems.

What you get with this is a product key for one copy of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote.  You do not get Publisher or Access.  In addition, this product key is only for one PC, not for use with a tablet or mobile device.  Skype and the 1TB OneDrive cloud storage option are also not included.

The intended user of this product would be the owner of a single PC in need of an Office suite.  A benefit of this product is the lack of a subscription based model meaning there is no expiration date.

To download the product, you need a Microsoft Account.

So my installation target for this was a brand new HP All-In-One, a higher end model with plenty of disk space and a current generation CPU and 16GB of RAM running Windows 10.

Installation was relatively painless and I had no issues, thankfully.  I did note all of the problems people have reported with downloading.

Everything seemed fine at first but I started to have major issues with Outlook hanging upon startup (not crashing).  Running Outlook in safe mode didn't work either.  To make a long story short, I finally solved this issue myself by noticing that I had incorrectly typed the password for my POP3 email server.  Believe it or not, correcting this password ended the startup hang.  I'm a software developer by trade and seeing this lack of error handling in a commercial product is alarming.

I had a bunch of emails saved in Windows Live Mail which I wanted to import (with no access to the Live Mail application, only the saved data) - no easy way to do this.  It took me quite a while to determine how to do this.

As for the rest of the suite, Powerpoint seems relatively unchanged as does Excel and Word.

For Enterprise users, there is a built in collaboration feature in Word 2016 which would be useful.  There is a tweak to the help system up in the ribbon bar which states ""Tell me what you want to do...""  This is essentially a quick search feature.  I also noticed a right click context menu addition called ""Smart Lookup"" which allows you to highlight a word and select Smart Lookup.  A Bing-powered search engine lookup features a definition of the highlighted word.  For writing mathematical equations, there is a feature called Ink Equation in which you can jot equations by hand (touch device, stylus, etc).  This is an improvement over the earlier Equation editor.  Other than that, the only improvement I saw was with Shapes (more presets, perhaps).

I am a frequent user of Excel so I was eager to learn what changed in Excel 2016. There are some new chart types, as far as I can tell they are Treemap, Sunburst, Histogram, Box & Whisker and Waterfall.  I could see myself using Histogram.  There are other changes common to all of the Office apps such as sharing and the stuff I mentioned about Word.

One thing to mention is that Office365 subscribers get feature updates which will not be available to the users of this product.

My evaluation of Office 2016 Home & Office is that it is intended for a specific audience.  Most users will get more out of Office 365 these days.  I guess I would expect a lot of improvements (both speed, stability and feature-wise) from a major new release.  I don't really see all that many groundbreaking improvements here.

I really miss the days of having a CD/DVD to install a product like this versus a cumbersome and slow download process.  Entering a product key and selecting Activate used to work fairly well.

Overall, if you have a new PC and have not used Office 365 before, this is a good option for getting a current Office suite.  I didn't have download and activation issues but many have.  The hanging with Outlook was not a nice touch and left me wondering if this product has been properly tested and debugged prior to deployment. I would suggest Office365 (yes, even with the subscription expy) so you at least get current updates to features.  The other thing I dislike about this is the ""use only on 1 PC"" thing.",Not a huge leap in feature improvements,1464134400,,

It protects your logins and passwords by creating a secure private connection. Very important for those who conduct business in coffee shops, and regularly log on to secure sites in public. It accomplishes this task by creating a VPN and encrypting your connection and making it invisible on public networks, so spy software will not be able to track it. According to product literature it also protects you during app usage on your iOS devices. Of course, you can also use it at home for better encryption.

Although Norton says that it will not cause any slowdown in the bandwidth, I keep experiencing delays, especially on public networks. It's hard to tell what's causing it though as the public networks are public and there are multiple users logged on at any time. The software also starts automatically on Mac and Windows. For iOS you will have to turn on VPN protection in settings. Then go into Norton settings to make the privacy protection manual. That will allow you to manually enable VPN protection when you are on a public network, otherwise you will experience slow speeds on secure networks.

It's good to use some sort of privacy when logged on to public networks, but given the slow down I won't use it if I am just watching youtube or casual websurfing.

The benefit of the subscription is you are allowed to have Office 2013 installed on 5 computers.  It is important to note that you will need to use the Microsoft account you used to register the software to install the software on the 5 computers.  There is no option to send other household members a link to install the software.  You do not need to stay logged once the software is installed.  It is also important to note that you will need Windows 7 or 8 to install Office 2013.

If you are already using Office 2010 I do not see any major improvement to move to Office 365. Office 2013 is very similar to Office 2010 but integrated with the cloud.

Here some of the biggest issues I have with Office 365 Home Premium.  I reached out to Microsoft support to verify my findings. I kept the complete chat log.

All these so called benefits / add-ons are only good for the person who signed up for Office 365 Home Premium.

You can sign them up a regular Microsoft account, so that gets a 5GB skydrive, Office Web Apps that integrates with Office 2013

That being said as the primary account holder you do get a good value. Microsoft recently added the Office App for Android and IOS.

I had a skydrive when they offered 25GB, so I now 45GB of cloud storage that I can sync between by laptop and desktop with a Skydrive install.

I rarely used Skype in the past and that will most likely continue even with the included minutes.  I still have not used the Office on Demand, so I cannot provide an opinion

You have to decide if Office 365 Home premium.  If there was more flexibility with household accounts I would rate a minimum of 4 stars.  If you are XP and Vista user you should not purchase this product.

That went quickly also, thought I was hooked up to my sister's high speed router, and not my usual dial-up connection...so, I don't know how fast or slow the update would have been with dial-up. Next, I did a full scan, and Kaspersky found 4 infected files with something ""very dangerous"" in them.

Two weeks later, the daily updates for Kaspersky install very quickly, even on dial-up.  And they don't slow down my PC.  McAfee's updates slowed down my PC, and sometimes they were so long, I had to go hook up my laptop to my sister's high speed router to do them.  McAfee had a maintenance feature, though, and this version of Kaspersky does not; so, I'm going to have to remember to start doing maintenance PC stuff now.  Also, interestingly, Kaspersky does not have a firewall, although it does have spyware protection.  Thus, you must use your Windows firewall, which is fine with me...as long as I don't have to use Windows Defender!

Thus, so far, I'm happy with Kaspersky...and am looking forward to hopefully an uneventful year.",Is Working Fine So Far....,1255737600,,

The amount of export options has to be a big plus, and it includes the ability to easily format any video file or project for any of your mobile devices including your iPod, iPhone, Zune, PSP, etc.  That's a huge thing that many people are looking for.

Some of the newer options like HD and BlueRay authoring aren't going to get wide use immediately, but they are must-haves for the growing HD crowd out there.

Within Video Studio there are a few basic options.  The Movie Wizard is a quick and dirty import and export tool.  This is the easiest option to choose to convert, trim and condense video files.  There's also a bunch of templates included for standard transitions to add some openings, endings, fades and credits.  Once again, even with the Wizard alone you can really clean up some video files fast.

You can even import them directly from you digital recorder, but I opt to save my files and import them afterwords.  I always like to have a backup seperate from what I'm working on, so this makes it easier for me to keep track of my import and export areas.

In the full blown Video Studio tool you can open up video and audio files and add them to a project.  The benefit of that is that you can merge and splice your files and add custom transitions and graphics to really make your videos pop.  Once again, there's a lot of features here.  You really have to spend some time playing and exploring.

Media One is kind of an extra, but it makes it easy to do some basic graphics and picture stuff to add to your videos.  Another extra is Intermedia DVD player, which is included on many OEM system software packages but didn't come with my box.  So that's a nice extra too.

One positive thing is that there are a bunch of tutorials and help file documentats included on your extras disks.  There's also plenty of clips to play with and test your skills on.  If you haven't done video editing before that's probably the best place to start.

Still, I think this program is user friendly enough to do basic things like import / export and conversions out of the box.  Since most people will want to start by collecting all their videos, that's a nice plus in terms of the usability.

One con I have to note is that converting videos to certain formats seems to use pre-set frame rates that take some time to customize.  And it seems to convert some of these formats frame by frame, instead of using much faster file conversion techniques.  Behind the scenes it may be doing more, but for this price I don't really mind waiting a few minutes for my files to convert.

I also own the Pinnacle software that comes with their integrated hardware offering,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinnacle-Studio-MovieBox-Ultimate/dp/B000WEJN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinnacle Studio MovieBox Ultimate</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-Ultimate-Version-12/dp/B001AMSZSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio Ultimate Version 12</a>.  While there are more basic versions of the software that are closer in price to this guy, I find that the Corel Ulead software is more stable overall.

Don't get me wrong, the Movie-box ultimate package is a great value because it includes the hardware interface.  If you don't have all the connectors you need, that might be a good alternative.  But if you just compare software to software, Corel Ulead stacks up well against Pinnacle Studio Ultimate.

Truth be told, for this price I have to forgive the other minor cons I noted.  That includes mainly that the menu and icon graphics aren't the snazziest.  Still, compared to Apple's Built-in editor and Windows built-in movie editor (from Vista Ultimate) this guy includes more formats and features right out of the box.  And once again, for what you get this is really a great value in software.

Definitely check this out.  The Corel site has some clips and information to get you more used to the kinds of things you can produce.

While usually I prefer paying once for software, it's hard to look at the pricing and not see the value in considering the cloud version. You not only get 1 TB of cloud storage, you get the full suite of products, at a price that gives you two years of access for less than the standalone software costs. Of course, Mac users still don't get ALL the software that PC users get, and until they do, I will not give ANY Office version more than 4 stars at best. While I wouldn't tend to use Access as much these days, Publisher is software that absolutely should be included in the Mac version when PC users get it. However, this review is for Home and Student which only includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Note that Outlook is not included, something to be aware of if you are looking at purchasing this version, over the 365 Personal license which DOES include it. Of these, OneNote is the application I haven't used a whole lot, simply because I have so much in Evernote and haven't really had a need to look at migrating to OneNote. You can get OneNote as a standalone on the Mac Store for free, so it's worth looking at if you don't already use Evernote, but if you do want to use it, you almost certainly would want the 365 version so you have cloud storage for easy sharing of your notes across your desktop and mobile devices. Likewise a lot of the newer features in the other applications require cloud storage, such as sharing features. While you don't have to have a 365 license to use these, the only cloud services available are MS's OneDrive cloud service and Sharepoint. It's very annoying that they don't offer such popular cloud services like Dropbox but clearly they want to push users to get the 365 licenses instead which include the full 1TB of storage. If you don't need to keep a lot of docs on OneDrive though, the free account may work fine for you.

Now if you are a current Office for Mac user, the question is whether there are suitable updates here to look at upgrading. If you are more than 1 or two versions behind, it's pretty much a given that you would want to update, the new ribbon (toolbar) is much more elegant and user friendly, proper keyboard shortcuts are available, the various Mac touch gestures are supported, etc. And there's tons of improvements in the  applications themselves. I particularly loved the new theme designer feature in Powerpoint which gives you not only many more slide designs, but makes it really easy to switch them to different color schemes. Slide transitions are now better supported across PC and Mac versions and there is an improved presenter view, and dedicated animations panel. The formula designer in Excel has been updated, and there is better support for the full range of functions that the PC version had. More chart designs are now available, and comments in Word can now be fully threaded conversations. Print to PDF is better in all the apps, as well. Overall, the features definitely are worth a look, but the lack of Outlook and high cost for just the 3 main programs (OneNote being free to download anyway) does make it a bit hard to recommend this version over a 365 license. If you don't need Outlook, don't have a need to upgrade your apps very often, don't plan to use cloud sharing much, and mainly just want copies of the applications for cross-platform support with PC users that send you files, this might be worth considering versus the 365 version, but you'll need to use it for more than 2 years before you see any savings. So I rather the upgrade as a solid 4 stars, but I'd give this specific version only 3 stars for the value that you are getting for the price.",Worthy upgrade but MS clearly wants to push users over to the 365 versions,1445385600,7.0,

There were some opportunity areas (for example, if you add a music file to a menu you have no way to edit the audio file or select a portion of it, I have to use Cool Edit to format the audio file to what I need) So I thought the retail version would have more functionalities than the one I already had and decided to get this one.

First of all I had no problems installing it, while I am stuck with the awful Windows Vista, installation ran smoothly and with no incidents. The software comes with a manual that I honestly have not used, the features are very easy to use and so far I have not needed to consult the user guide.

There are three applications and only two of them I have used, the one I haven't tried I really do not have a use for it which is to extract video files from a camera or similar device. I own a Sony DHC and I use the basic windows functionality to extract the files from it.

The first one I'd like to talk about is the video editing software included. While it may not have as many functionalities as the retail box makes you believe, it has some interesting features. First of all, it allows you to select an intro theme to your video which then you can add music to, same as the DVD factory I previously owned, there is no way to edit the audio you use in here, so say the intro is about 10 seconds and you add an mp3 file of over a minute, the song will play over the menu AND your video. There is a neat feature that allows you to trim your video and select the bits and pieces you want to keep or remove. What I liked the most is that this program offers the possibility of extracting video from a DVD and then edit the video on your own. I tried several of my home made DVDs and some of them worked and some others didn't, which is a shame but I believe it might be due to the way in which they were recorded, the ones that didn't work were recorded with a DVD recorder I got to copy my VHS into DVDs. I also tried some music DVD's I own playing with the idea of creating a music video compilation, well, it worked. What the program does is that it extracts the selected video track from the DVD into an mpeg file, from there you can edit it or keep a backup copy of it if you like.

After you are done editing and preparing your videos you can then create your movie. So far I have only created DVDs and VCDs and it has worked great, there are several templates included, some of them look very professional and some others look like they were made in power point, fortunately, the menus can be personalized and you can add/remove things to your taste. In the case of DVD menus there is a feature that allows you to edit the background music, something I really appreciated as I won't have to rely on an external program to do so.

Overall, a great product with some neat functionalities, I have lots of videos I have taken with my Sony camera as well as others I have downloaded and I am happy I got this product.

WinZip has won accolade after accolade since it was first introduced in 1991 for being one of the best file compression software packages.  If you are interested in compressing files to send as emails, to reduce the size of your archives or to save space on your computer, then you should certainly consider WinZip.  If you are thinking of upgrading from an earlier version of WinZip, you may want to question the advantages of doing so.

Compression Speed
I have been using WinZip 7 for years and so I expected much faster performance with WinZip 15, especially since WinZip advertises that version 15 has a brand new zip engine which requires less time to compress files.  However, I found that despite the new zip engine, the speed of the file compression was about the same as the older version that I had been using.  This may be a function of the age of my computer, but overall, the lack of any noticeable increase in speed was disappointing given the difference in the age of the versions I was using.  Therefore, I don't really see any real advantage of upgrading to WinZip 15 if you are using an older version of WinZip unless you can take advantage of the zipx file.

Zipx File
When using WinZip 15 to compress files, the user has the option of choosing the legacy compression (zip file) or the zipx file which was introduced in WinZip 12.  Zipx offers the advantage of creating smaller compressed files.  However, while zip files can be opened by most compression utilities including the one installed with Windows, zipx files can only be opened by WinZip 12 or later or by a few other compression utilities.  Therefore, zipx files are not as ideal for compressing files you plan to share with others.  To see the difference between the zip and zipx files, I zipped the contents of the My Documents folder which included photos and other multimedia.  The zip file resulted in 25% compression while the zipx file resulted in 33% compression.  However, I have also tried compare the results of compressing Word documents which have lots of images included.  I found that the zipx compression resulted in files that were actually slightly larger than the comparable zip files. The same also happened when I tried to zip mp3 files.  However, in the case of jpeg files, zipx files are 20% smaller than the original or the zip file.  While the advantage of the zipx file is not staggering, it is an improvement if you are creating files for archiving, especially if the archive includes JPEGs.

Installation on Two Computers
It is permissible to install the single license version of WinZip on two computers, as long as they are not used simultaneously.  The exact wording from the WinZip user agreement is:  ""If you have purchased a single-user license you have the right to install and use a single copy of WinZip on one computer or workstation for non-simultaneous use by one or more persons and install a second copy of WinZip on another computer or workstation for the exclusive use of the person who is the primary user of the first copy of WinZip.""

Interface
WinZip gives the option of using the Wizard or the Classic interface.  The Wizard is easy to use and takes the user through simple steps and questions to zip or unzip files.  The classic view includes many more options including 128- and 256-bit key password protection for the zipped files.  It is also possible to zip and unzip files by right clicking on the files in the Windows Explorer.

File Types
In addition to compressing files, WinZip opens and extracts content from the industry's widest selection of compressed file types, including Zip, Zipx, RAR, 7Z, BZ2, LHA, CAB, IMG, ISO, and most other file archive formats.

Email
Click on the mail button in the WinZip interface and WinZip will automatically open your default mail program (including Outlook and web based email such as Hotmail or Gmail).  In the case of Hotmail, I would have expected the first page which is opened to be the page for composing emails.  This is the case if you are already logged into Hotmail, but if you are not, the first page you see is the inbox.  I then had to close the browser page and click on email again in WinZip to start the message composition, but although the subject line of the message had the file name, I found that the file was not attached.  It may just be that WinZip and Hotmail using Internet Explorer do not play well together, but this was a bit disappointing.

Courier
WinZip 15 Standards includes a copy of Courier which automatically zips all files attached to an outgoing email. Courier is great if you regularly email compressed files or photos.  The supported email clients include Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, Gmail and Hotmail.  When you attach files to an email, the standard dialogue box appears which allows you to choose the file to attach.  Courier adds to this window, controls to zip, encrypt or to resize photos which is a useful tool.  There is the option to make zipping files the default which would be useful if you send zipped files quite often, but annoying if you don't want to always zip files and forget that Courier will do this automatically.

Summary
If you don't currently own a compression utility and you would like to compress files for archiving, emailing or to save space on your computer, then you should definitely consider WinZip 15.  The Wizard interface makes zipping files easy for even novice users and the classic interface includes a lot of options for those who want more control of the process. However, if you are considering upgrading from a version of WinZip prior to version 12, you may want to reconsider unless you can take advantage of the compression of JPEG files using the zipx format.",The standard for compressing files and installable on two computers,1303171200,,

Another surprise, installation woes. Windows 7 in 2012, and you still can't install a simple program without issues. In my case, on a quadcore AMD 64-bit Windows 7 computer. On the third installation attempt, the Program Compatibility Assistant finally sorted it out on its own and the darned thing installed.

After the successful installation, you run the software for the first time. You have the option to register it, and then it automatically checks for updates on the internet.

From within the program, you can then select to install the State Program. You get one free State program with this version, but not a free state e-file. You can purchase additional State programs if you need multiple states. Installation of the State program is a program installation in itself, you have to close the H&R software and go through the installers.

Preparing taxes was the usual routine, going through the different Q&A screens, and on and on. Navigation, usability, and explanations could have been better. The e-filing part worked without issue. The Search feature is borderline useless, it looks like something from 1999. The program gets things done when you slog through it, but after so many years at it, it should have been a lot better at it.

Another major point of irritation: you get five free federal e-files and zero state e-files. It would be more fair if they offered five free e-files and it would be up to the consumer to decide how to use them, federal or state or a combination! Overall it does what it's supposed to do, in a rather clumsy fashion, but you can get things done.

I have not used the customer support or live help options, so I can't comment on them.

The lessons feature of Garage Band might be something I might use. The additions to iWeb are good but the program still is only useful for a personal site. It just doesn't offer the search engine optimization capabilities or speed of loading that a business site needs in today's web environment. iDVD has some expanded features and new themes but isn't a have-to-have update.

I'll cover iPhoto first. The new face recognition ability is awesome and amazingly good. I never bothered to make smart albums of individuals before. I went through several thousand photos in a few hours and did that with ease. That one feature makes almost the purchase price worth it all by itself. Geotagging is great. I gave my recent vacation photos location tags and will continue to do so. I'm researching a handheld GPS to sync with my camera so I automate the process. As the number of geotagged photos grows, especially my bird and travel shots. This could turn into a terrific feature. And the tags translate to Flickr maps.

The new built in sharing features in iPhoto are also nice. I can upload to Flickr without exporting and using Flickr's flaky software, or without having to buy a third party plugin. iPhoto also works with Facebook. There are existing free upload plugins for other services like Picasa and Shutterbug that should work.

iMovie has gotten back some of the functionality it lost in the 08 ""upgrade"", not all of it and you still can't use the old third party plugins I bought prior to that, but it is better. The anti-shake function actually does a pretty good job of smoothing out hand held clips. And being able to edit audio directly in the program is very nice. It's a good but not spectacular move up from the last version.

I use Garage Band, too. The new features are limited here. There are some nice interface tweaks. Those don't add much in the way of functionality, but it looks nice. For guitar players, Garage Band has some added effects.

The ability to buy lessons might prove to be a good feature. That will depend on what lessons become available. Right now Apple seems more interested in getting big names for the lessons than great teachers.  Whether or not the lesson library becomes worthwhile will be something I'll watch.

I have a 2gig AMD 64 dual core processor.  After about a week, I noticed that my computer would progessively slow down day by day.  Which is funny since it hasn't gotten any more sophisticated.  It just takes more memory.  I have a gig of memory, but even with that, Vista was using around 68% at any given time...just to run the OS.  I could use a little extra memory for my system, but why would I want to spend money to upgrade my hardware just to run the same stupid tasks?

First of all, installation is slow. Even though I installed the program from the DVD, it still goes on line to install parts of the program. Even with a fast internet connection, downloading and installing those parts, especially .net, took a long time. Even more annoying is it tries to install the Bing search engine and MSN Live toolbar...pretty lame for such expensive software, but at least it gives you the option to opt out.

You have to activate it before you can use it, and it took four tries to activate over the internet.

The new interface is similar to the the one in '04, only with larger icons. Navigating is more clumsy, however. In MP 2004, there was a toolbar icon which toggled between zoom and pan mode. If you wanted to zoom in on an area, you held down the left mouse button and dragged a square and clicked inside it.

In MP 2010 left click/drag is only pan. To drag to zoom you have to use right click/drag. The only way to find this out is from the help files. Not hard to find, but an unnecessary ""improvement.""

Drag to zoom is also touchy...not always making a zoom box, but sometimes bringing up another dialog.

There's a handy Bing map icon, and it doesn't default to IE... it uses your default browser, a pleasant surprise. Bing map defaults to ""Aerial"" view, which is higher up and often in b&w vs. ""Bird's Eye"" which is color and better resolution. Google maps, however offer better resolution and closer views in most cases.

Another interface quirk I discovered: In the ""Search"" box, right click commands (cut, copy, paste) work. In the Trip Planner, however, they don't, and you must use the keyboard commands (<ctrl V>, etc).

I put in trip plans for known destinations and it was pretty good. The maps are up to date.

I don't have the other hardware to test the gps or mobile phone features.

I mainly use video editing programs to trim down personal videos to make them a more watchable and enjoyable size, so I'm reviewing this from that perspective.  I don't use these for film class or to try to become the next Spielberg.  I simply want to clean up and edit my video.  For this particular example, I used eight clips from a Sony Action cam that I recently filmed on vacation and an MP3 song encoded at 256kbps as background music. I only used one track each for video and audio.

The only effects I added were a few transitions. I'm not really into effects other than basic titles.  Since I planned to use this project as the example for my review, I added the transitions to see how theyd affect encoding.  My PC has an Intel 2.8mhz dual-core i7 processor, 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM, Nvidia Quadro 1000M GPU and is running 64-bit Windows 10.

I trimmed the eight clips down to about 7 minutes and trimmed the music to match. Other than the transitions, I added no other effects.  It took about 12 minutes to encode the video to a full-HD MP4 at 30fps.  Although the fan kicked on, it didn't seem to burden down my PC and the temperature hit a max of 126 degrees F while encoding. The end result was very good with clear video and sound and no dropped frames or other issues.

Usability is straightforward although those familiar with this type of video editing software will be up and running a little quicker than those coming from programs like the newer versions of iMovie.

Videostudio X9 meets my needs which are admittedly fairly basic.  I can't speak for how it will perform for someone who needs tons of special effects and features but if you need a good capable editor for simple to moderate complexity, it can definitely handle it.  It does so with reasonable resource usage.  My only complaint, which is not unique to this version, are the in-your-face ads to upgrade.

Or until I close the pop-up window, which again gives me annoyingly temporary access to my software.  Endlessly, I suppose.

I could comment on Microsoft upgrades generally, and how the company seems to have a malevolent genius for identifying those features of Word and Excel that I actual find quite useful and over-enhancing them until they are essentially unusable.

Windows 7 righted the fiasco of Vista and hopefully by October of 2013 ""Windows Blue"" aka Windows 8.1 will right Windows 8 or Metro without additional charge.

What is good about Windows 8:

In one word: fast.

What is not so good about Windows 8:  (oh boy...)

1.  The Metro interface is a mess for use on a desktop! Touch screen and the Metro interface is fine for tablets and phones, but for a desktop, most people want ease of use and they just want it to work.  Perhaps for a touch screen all in one computer, it might be ok.  For a desktop with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor - Windows 8 is a nuisance.  For many users who are upgrading, it is unfriendly and downright unusable.  Unless you are a power user or someone who embraces new ideas quickly, Windows 8 in it's present format is probably not for you.

2.  Microsoft doesn't seem to understand the basics of customer loyalty.  It is a big mistake to take away something you gave in a previous O/S.  Microsoft's ill conceived plan to leave out Windows Media Center and try to charge extra for it in Windows 8 (after the initial limited time give-away) is a huge mistake.  There are indications this will be corrected in Windows 8.1 as well.  Let's hope so!

Now for the big question:  HOW CAN YOU FIX IT?

One way to overcome the Metro interface is to use a free and relatively simple program which restores the desktop interface.  You can research these products by reviews on PCWORLD magazine online.  (Like any other program, you use it at your own risk!)  I chose a program called CLASSIC SHELL by the open source people at Sourceforge.  I am not affiliated with them and I cannot make any statement as to its suitability for you or your computer.  However, they are the people who have developed the popular open source programs VLC and 7-Zip.  The program is working very well for me.

Anyway, if you upgraded or bought a new pc with Windows 8, don't panic!  Once you get the desktop interface back, it is a reasonably good and stable O/S. Hopefully Microsoft has heard the outcry of their customers and have seen the plummeting sales of Windows 8 and new computers and will restore the ability to boot to the desktop interface and restore Windows Media Center as part of the O/S as well.

Happy computing!

Update:  July 14, 2013.  Although the Windows 8.1 update will be free, I still cannot recommend Windows 8 or 8.1 for the following reasons.

First, let the user decide whether they want to have a desktop or a mobile pc experience.  This means fully restoring the desktop menu system rather than providing a semi-functional start button.

Second, Windows Media Center needs to be part of the operating system and not some very expensive extra cost add-on.  Home theater computers are very popular and a great way to enjoy movies and music.  Windows Media Center must be restored as a standard feature to Windows 8.

Unless Microsoft wakes up, the rate of adoption of Windows 8 will remain very low.  It is much easier to migrate your Windows 7 operating system to the new computer rather than put up with the cumbersome mess that is Windows 8.",An unfortunate misstep once again for Microsoft,1367625600,8.0,

I have been a devoted Intuit ""Quicken"" user since the DOS days of the program way back in the early `80's.  I have strayed a few times--once with Microsoft Money, and another time with a program whose name now escapes me, it was so long ago.  In the end I have always come back to ""Quicken,"" a program I consider the best personal financial program on the market.  I like ""Quicken"" because it allows me to seamlessly track all of my checking and savings accounts, (almost all) investments, and home inventory in one modular, easy to use package.  And I use Quicken to bank on-line, an added convenience that has made check-writing, bill paying, and account reconciliation so much easier.

The last time I upgraded Quicken was in at the end of 2009; that is when I updated to Quicken Premiere 2009.  I did so because Quicken 2005 was becoming buggy, and rather than re-install the program I decide to upgrade.  Also, I never like to be more then two versions behind, and; finally I hoped there would finally be an easy way to track U.S. Saving Bonds within the program; better luck next upgrade.  And oh, yes, one last reason: I got the software fro free through work.

I decide to go with ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" this time around because employees of the company I work for are allowed to download the software from Intuit for free, and because my version was becoming dated.

Installation

If you have a previous version of Quicken on your computer, the installation process will remove it completely, so be forewarned; i.e. back up your Quicken data to a separate directory before you start the install process.  There is a caveat however, one can use keyboard shortcut keys to install the new version along-side the old version and operate both at the same time.  I do not keep my Quicken data in the same directory as the program files, so this was not a concern for me.  And I always back up my Quicken data after each session.

At the end of the install, the program prompts you to upgrade the just installed software, and if you have internet access, I recommend you do so.  After the upgrade I started ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" for the first time, at which point I had the option to either start a new file or convert an existing one; I choose the later.  My Quicken 2009 data file was converted seamlessly by ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" without the slightest bit of trouble, for which I will be eternally grateful.

First Impressions:

As I stated at the outset of this review, I track all of my finances through Quicken; i.e. checking, savings, 401(K), investments, Saving Bonds (I have to improvise, there is no way to directly track Bonds in Quicken), loans, etc., as well as a household inventory via the Quicken Home Inventory module included in the program.  Some of my accounts are electronic and this feature still works well under ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" although one of my major bank accounts still cannot download transactions automatically.

One of the first things you'll notice is the new desktop home page.  The lines have been softened, and there is a new logical flow that is easy on the eyes.  My accounts are laid out on the left hand pane divided into account types.  The account can be re-arranged to suit you individual tastes.  But really there is not much difference between this and the previous version of the software.

Intuit brings back the Projected Cash Flow under the ""Spending"" tab at the top of the screen underneath the menu bar.  Quicken uses this area to give you a snapshot of money coming in verse money going out, by automatically tracking deposits from all accounts and bills.  I pay little attention to the area; it is nice to look at but I find its use limited.  Below this area there are a further three tabs entitled Scheduled Bills & Deposits, Account Balance Graph, and Spending Graph.  Again I see very little practical use for any of the areas, but they can be customized.

Other tabs across the top of the screen include: Bills, Planning, Investing and Property & Debt.  Again, I found little useful information underneath these tabs, but they are colorful and if you have a 401(k) the Investment tab might find some use.

With ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" you can set-up several account types, which the program divides up into four categories: Spending which encompasses the following account types: Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts, Credit Cards, and Cash; Investments: Brokerage, IRA or Keogh Plan, 401(k) or 403(b), and 529 Plan; Property: House, Vehicle, and Other Assets, and; Debt: Loan and Other Liability (not a credit card).

Each account can be associated with a bank or banking institution and the usually account information added; e.g. account number, opening balance, bank website, interest rates, etc.

One-Step Update

Almost everything I do in Quicken involves the On-line Center (replaced by One-step Update in Quicken Premiere 2011).  Via the One-Step Update I can gain access to most of my banking and investment accounts from which I can download transactions in one step.  Once the accounts are set up, the account information is saved to the Pin Vault and thereafter I can download my most recent transaction into my account registers.  Once downloaded the transactions can either be accepted all at once or one by one.  This beats keeping a written register!

Conclusion

Is there a compelling reason to upgrade to ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" from previous versions of the software?  Not really, unless you need the specific functionality the software brings to the table.  There have been slight improvements to the interface and a few new features associated with business use, but overall the program is unchanged.  The minor changes hardly justify the steep upgrade price of $64.99 (Amazon.com price).

And where is my support for bonds, bonds, bonds?  Surely I am not the only one who buys and tracks bonds.  Bond, be they U.S. Treasury Department Saving Bonds, Treasury Bills, Municipal Savings Bonds, or Corporate Bonds, as an important part of any diversified investment portfolio.  Get it together Intuit!

Despite the continued lack of support for Bonds, ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" is still the way to go if you want to simplify your (personal) financial life without a lot of fuss.

QuickBooks has the small business accounting software market almost to itself, although mostly on Windows.  Apple's market share in computing significantly increased during my hiatus and there has been a shift towards the internet, mobile devices and, more recently, the cloud.  Whether QuickBooks will fully embrace these changes has yet to be seen.  Intuit provides more services to small businesses than it used to and it is even teaming up with Bank of America to integrate software and financial services, although whether that will benefit small business owners, it is also too soon to know.

The basic software seems to be the same with tweaks and incremental improvements rather than a complete rebuild from the ground up.  It still doesn't do everything for everyone but it will allow the majority of small businesses owners to take care of most of the day-to-day bookkeeping and allow an accountant to use the files to submit a tax return, and at a very reasonable cost compared to what this would have cost just a few decades ago.

Some of the newer features are being able to have multiple users with access restricted only to certain functions such as payroll, tracking project time and expenses and billing them to clients, and exporting report data to Microsoft Excel.  Incredibly, batched importing of online banking transactions is new for 2012.  The overall look and feel has also been improved for Mac users.

Still, the Mac version does not have all the capabilities and features of the Windows version and it doesn't seem that this will change.  Apple computers can now run Windows and Windows-compatible software and the two operating systems have also become more similar.  So for most small business owners with Apple computers, the real question is not whether to use QuickBooks but whether to use the Windows or Mac version.  Ironically, at a time when Apple operating systems are gaining market share, starting out on or switching over to QuickBooks for Windows is now a much better option for Mac users than it ever has been.",Incremental improvements,1320537600,13.0,

Based on the high quality offering of the ""German Level 1, 2, 3"" set, that reputation appears to be well deserved.  The package is far more than just a book on German in digital form, and includes many extra features to make the whole thing worth the hefty price tag.

The three level German language software comes with a USB headset so that the user can listen to the lessons without disturbing anyone around them.  The headset has a built-in microphone that works with the software's speech recognition feature, which lets the user know how they are doing with the language.  A quick-start fold out card is also included, complete with pictures and step-by-step instructions, to get the user started quickly.

The software isn't hard to install, but it is a very long process.  The entire installation could take more than a half hour, especially if the massive web updates are downloaded.  Any decent computer system should be able to handle the software, as the program only requires 512 MB of RAM and 1.8 GB of hard drive space.  Both Windows XP and Windows Vista are currently supported.  There is an interesting option that can be set during the installation to change the software to start with a different language.  The program doesn't have to go from English to German, but can instead begin with several different starting languages.  That alone already makes it more versatile than any German language book could ever be.

Another neat add-on that is included is a set of stickers that can be attached to a keyboard.  The stickers mimic a German language keyboard, which will make typing in German easier once the basics of the language have been mastered.  The user's guide is also exceedingly comprehensive, so any questions about how to use the software shouldn't require a call to tech support.

Once the program is installed and started there are several different course options to choose from.  Each option tackles a different aspect of learning the language, such as reading, writing, and speaking.  The default option is to learn all three at once, but for those who don't have enough time for the full course or are only interested in one of the courses there is the option to remove one or two of the features.
As the name suggests there are three levels to the software, each building on the concepts in the last.  As the user progresses through the program they switch out the CDs to the next level.  The program also comes with multiple audio companion CDs so that the user can practice their German when they aren't in front of their computer.

You're going to need just one piece of hardware -- a camera! (either a webcam or DSLR). If you already have a webcam set up, it will appear in Stopmotion Studio as a Camera Device in the dropdown menu as an option.

Before you start a stopmotion movie, you need to specify the Capture Size (resolution) and Frame Rate. The highest Capture Size you can select via a dropdown menu is camera dependent. For example, using my webcam, I can select a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080 (Full HD). The frame rates you can select via another dropdown menu range from 5 to 30. For more fluid motion in your stopmotion movie, select a higher frame rate. But remember, if you pick 30 as the frame rate -- that's 30 frames per second -- you're going to need to re-position and take snapshots of your character(s) 30 times to get  a WHOPPING ONE second of movie!

The Stopmotion Studio interface is very intuitive. It consists of 3 panels: (1) View Screen (2) Control Panel (3) Storyboard (filmstrip). The View Screen gives you a liveview of your camera. After you capture a snapshot, a thumbnail of it appears in the Storyboard. You can play and edit your movie in the Storyboard as you go along. The Control Panel lets you add a grid to the liveview in the View Screen to help you position your characters precisely where you need them (the grid size can be adjusted). One VERY nifty feature in the Control Panel is called Key Drawing. Key drawing lets you sketch over the View Screen, so you can mark the position(s) of your character(s) in the next frame.

There are also special effects you can play around with, like green screen, which allows you to change the background (your backyard, for example) after production. You can also get really artistic and use the drawing and painting tools to add other elements (like gunsmoke, flare, and laser beam).

This application comes with licensing for 5 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but probably not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Windows Setup:

Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:

I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox would not start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). It was good I found a solution because this virtual machine is critical to my business. This was the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.

Since then I found the settings for exclusions. It isn't on the security page reached via the advanced button as one might expect, but found from the small gear icon for settings at the top of the control panel. The exclusions are buried in this group of settings pages. Go to settings, antivirus, scans tab, to Exclusions/Low Risks and then finally items to exclude.

If you want an integrated on-line backup solution, you might want to consider getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;that supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. For the difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a mile way from its actual location!!
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty lame. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antivirus products used on this computer did not, and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but does not include some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders.

Preface:
After being disappointed with Leopard 10.5 -which I also reviewed- I kept using Tiger. When finally 10.5.2 arrived I began using it. It fixes many Leopard bugs. According to some websites, at least 130 bugs have been fixed. This is important since many problems with third party software may be related to other software or to the operating system. For example, Apple is aware of problems with its Sync services and Core Image. Also, some bugs have existed for many years and have not been fixed, such as a potential bug when moving data to an external device.
Keeping these issues in mind I did a completely clean install of Leopard 10.5.2 in a brand new hard drive.
I installed Office 2008 as well as the available upgrade to 12.0.1.

First Impressions:
Some useful features have been added, such as Elements Gallery, which may be a time saver for many people. Some features have been removed, such as VBA, and this may be a deal-breaker for many people.
I'm keeping Office 2004 in a separate partition in order to use previous versions of Word and Excel.
At the same time, I can still use the new versions when I don't need the VBA features.
Lack of VBA support was announced well over a year ago, so this came as no surprise.

Starting up:
Each program took approximately 10 seconds to launch. Office seems to have a peculiar way of handling fonts, though, and launch times can be greatly effected. After installing another program that installed more fonts, and installing Extensis Fusion to manage my fonts, launch times for Office programs was approximately 150 (one hundred and fifty) seconds, instead of the original 10 (ten) seconds.
Now it takes about a minute to launch these programs. In all fairness, the slow down is partly caused by third party software.

Overall (and very brief)  impressions:
PowerPoint works with presentations that used to crash my 2004 version. The 2004 version was practically unusable for me. This was a welcome upgrade.

Excel works fine and the Elements Gallery is a good addition. It lost VBA support and the Abalysys Toolpack. I kept the 2004 version as well.

Word seems to be a solid upgrade. Some third party templates do not work with 2008, so I kept Word 2004.

Entourage works very well. I had to re-select the folders that I had set up for my rules, and re-apply categories to my folders. Syncing with Address Book always adds many duplicate contacts. Fortunately there are scripts to deal with this inconvenience. Hyperlinks still require a workaround, as mentioned by another reviewer. I would not rate Office with 1-star solely based on that issue.

Expression Media used to be called iView MediaPro, iView Multimedia, and iView many years ago. It used to be a $25 shareware program when I first used it. Eventually it became quite expensive so I never upgraded until I received this version. So far I'm happy with it. It has worked fine for cataloging thousands of fonts and pictures, and I'm entitled to a free upgrade when version 2 comes out.

Price:
There are free Office alternatives, as well as iWork. I( still prefer Microsoft Office for the most part. The only exception may be Keynote 4.
Microsoft offered a substantial discount under the names of The Technology Guarantee Program and the Super Suite Deal. Additionally, for one day they offered a $[...] rebate. So users could get the Mac Special Media Edition for approximately $[...]-$[...] with these offers.
Had it not been for the offer, I would have stayed with Office 2004. I've used Office 2008 for a few days, every day, and so far have encountered no problems.

Overall I'm satisfied with the upgrade. Support has been great, both by Microsoft and the MVP people. Search their forums and you'll find a lot of useful advise.",Interesting update to Office 2004,1205798400,62.0,

I had been concerned that I might need to go back and reinstall my old copy of Vista in order to install the Upgrade Edition, so I was very relieved everything worked fine on top of the RC.

As part of setup, the Windows 7 Upgrade Edition scans the disk to check that you have a valid version of Windows installed.  On my two systems, it accepted the Windows 7 RC.  I chose to do a custom ""clean"" install, so I deleted my existing partitions during install.  After installing Windows, I entered my license key and activated, without any issues.

You're immediately thrown into the language you want to learn -- there's no English allowed. This sounds daunting, but the software starts you off at such a rudimentary level it isn't intimidating.

I really like how the program keeps track of what areas I'm botching and pulls me back into those areas for more work. I also like the pronunciation practice via the included headset, although I can't verify it's always catching me when I'm mispronouncing things. To my ear I'm doing OK, but my ear isn't the best, hence my use of this program. If I'm pronouncing things badly and the program isn't always catching my errors, I'm not sure how I'd know, if you see what I mean. My hope is that I can nail the rudiments of Italian and get a good grip on simple conversations using Rosetta Stone before trying to find people to practice with/on, thus keeping my embarrassment factor low.

Thankfully, the app employs a good variety of interactive methods (matching pictures to sentences, writing caption for photos, hearing words and phrases pronounced correctly by native speakers, etc.) so the ""by rote"" factor stays low. Rosetta Stone says its techniques are modeled on how native speakers actually learn their own languages, usually while still kids, and I think that's a good description for what the software delivers. You start with words and then move on to phrases, and then with level two you get to conversations. Level three kicks the conversational up a couple of notches. It's a natural progression.

I think there are people who prefer a more standard ""grammar-first"" approach because they've found in the past that this is what works for them. I imagine there are also people who don't like looking at computer screens for lengthy periods. These are valid concerns. There are different pedagogical approaches for a reason -- not everyone learns in the same way. My guess is that Rosetta Stone would serve the majority of people very well, especially students who are comfortable with computer-based learning. Ideally, I think this program will work best for people who are studying a language using many ""inputs"" (text books, audio programs, computer apps, foreign-language media, foreign flicks, native speakers, etc.) All of these things will ultimately reinforce one another. The more immersion, the better.

Overall, I am very pleased with this product. The program's interface is well-designed, I've experienced no bugs or glitches, and I am making progress faster than I thought I would (or at least I think I am). I'd give the app five stars but I cringe just a little bit at the price. I don't think it is overpriced for what you get, mind you, but the cost -- well, it is what it is. There is a demo on the Rosetta Stone Web site that I encourage you to try before buying. It'll give you a good idea how well this program will work for you. If you like the approach, the price for all three levels is well worth it.

Keep in mind that learning any foreign tongue will realistically take a while. Rosetta Stone shortens the learning period a good deal and makes sticking with the program easier, but it's only a foundation.

After awhile, they all became a blur with features being added, and then dropped, without rhyme or reason. Overall, however, there was nothing that really made it a better version of Windows.

Windows 7 shows proof that Microsoft listened to the customers and decided to give them a product that met their needs.  Windows 7 (I'm referencing the Ultimate version, 64 bit) was a very long install (I upgraded from Vista) clocking in at 5 hours. Immediately I felt a pang of disappointment when it did not keep all of my settings (sounds, image size for folders). However, that was not the end of the world and I promptly forgot about it when I realized that Microsoft gave us Windows 7 and they managed to provide me with two necessary elements where I refused to compromise: the program gave me back disk space so I went from a hard drive almost half full to one that now has 65% disk space free.

 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

As a long-time user of Corel's ""Graphics Suite"" bundle of graphics software, this is my first experience with their Photo/Video bundle, even though I have also previously used both the separate ""VideoStudio Pro X2"" and ""PaintShop Pro Photo X2"" packages.  What makes this bundled package so attractive is that for a very competitive price (especially now that their X4 versions are released), you get a set of very useful software for editing both photos and videos.

PaintShop Photo Pro X3 continues to improve ever since Corel acquired it from Jasc Software in 2004, and the new X3 version offers better RAW support along with new features for manipulating and carving objects out from an image and scaling images.  Of course, PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is not Photoshop, but it is also farrrrrr more user-friendly to photo enthusiasts who just want easy-to-use options for correcting and enhancing their photos without lots of fuss.  There are lots of cool, useful, interesting, or sometimes strange special effects that you can apply to your photos, ranging from giving people suntans to removing facial blemishes and age wrinkles to even making people look skinnier (a timely special effect, considering the population obesity that is on the rise).  Although not a huge improvement and rework of the X2 version, PaintShop Photo Pro X3 continues to enhance its ""Photoshop For The Masses"" approach to photo editing.

As for VideoStudio Pro X3, I previously used VideoStudio Pro X2 and I really liked its ""Movie Wizard"" mode as a wonderful way to ease the learning curve and let you create professional-looking videos quickly for instant gratification.  The X3 version improves upon X2 with new filters and templates.

Corel Painter Essentials 4 provides a fun limited subset of the functionality found in the full ""Painter"" software.  ""Painter"" occupies a very unique niche in its ability to manipulate photos and turn them into images that look like oil paintings, watercolors, pastels, and pencil sketches.  I also have ""Corel Painter 11"" and there are sometimes photos and situations where Painter's abilities cannot be replicated by any other photo editing software (yes, not even by using the full-blown Photoshop).  One of my favorite ways to use Corel Painter is to convert a landscape photo or portrait into a French Impressionist painting; either printing this out or displaying it on a Web page always gets compliments.

As with Corel's Graphic Suite (I have their X4 version), the software comes with printed User Guides, a 137-page PaintShop Pro X3 User Guide, a 155-page VideoStudio Pro X3 User Guide, and a separate ""Getting Started Guide"" for both of these too. I like a combination of a printed User Guide along with more detailed searchable help information that is accessed from within the software, and I could never understand software companies who just have a lone CD floating around in a cardboard box without including hardcopy guides/documentation or, even worse, software that requires you to be connected to the Internet because all the documentation is posted on an external Web site.  Compared with each of Corel's Graphic Suite applications (i.e. Corel Draw and Corel Photo-Paint), the applications in Photo and Video Pro X3 feel like they run a bit slower.  PaintShop Photo Pro X3, in particular, seems to feel slower with each new version as it incorporates new features.  You definitely need at least 2-GB of memory on your computer, and it would help if you shut down other applications if you are performing extended photo and video editing.  I am sometimes amazed at the amount of software and processes that people have constantly running on their computers.  Of course, some of these processes and Windows services were piled on as new software got loaded onto their computer.",Great value-packed bundle of software for photos and video.,1321315200,,

They often try to do too much -- probably to convince you that they're more valuable than the freebies -- and wind up eating all your CPU cycles and bringing your computer to its knees. In fact, that was my initial experience with McAfee 2016 Total Protection on my Windows 10 x64 laptop. McAfee was consistently eating 18%-25% of my CPU, and I'm this wasn't during a periodic in-depth scan and it even persisted when I turned off ""real time protection.""

I contacted tech support for help. McAfee technical support is available 24 hours/day, which is nice, but it also enormously confusing, which is not. McAfee's web sites are poorly organized, often leading you around in circles as you try to figure out which link is the right one to follow. Part of the problem is that McAfee has recently been acquired by Intel, and they're still trying to get all their stuff integrated. Another problem is that almost none of the materials on their web site refers to Total Protection, which is either so new they haven't gotten around to documenting it yet, or it's already been discontinued, so they're never going to get around to documenting it. Skipping over the painful process of actually requesting service, I got a  pleasant woman from the Philippines on the line (good English; no complaints) who poked around my computer using LogMeIn and concluded that there was nothing wrong. She informed me that if McAfee is taking up 15% to 20% of CPU ALL THE TIME !!!! that's normal.

If that was normal, I would have removed it already. Fortunately, something she did, something I did, something in the most recent update, and/or something that Microsoft did with its most recent Windows 10 update (the most likely answer, I think) substantially resolved the problem, so, at this particular moment McAfee is using between 0.5% and 1.0% of CPU. Note that Real Time Protection may use a lot of CPU while you're doing backups, because it's checking each file as it's opened. This means that just at the time your computer is most loaded down, it will be even more loaded down ... which is OK as long as it happens while you're sleeping.

As for the Android portion of Total Protection. I (a) can't figure out what it is or what it does, and (b) can't figure out how to get it for my Amazon Fire Phone, which does not (without some minor hacking) have access to the Google Play store, the default repository for all Android apps. (Not McAfee's fault, of course.) There is no documentation available (as far as I can tell) about Total Protection for Android or iOS on the McAfee web site, which doesn't help. I tried getting support tonight, but their wait times at 10pm MST were so long that the chat program timed out on me three times and I wasn't able to  get someone on the phone before I had to take another call. So ... ?

Bottom line: If the current $29 price holds up, this is reasonable quality commercial computer protection for all the computers in your household. (I say ""reasonable quality"" because it's protection is rated as at least good by the independent evaluators, but it doesn't typically get top scores.) Support leaves something to be desired, but at least it's 24 hour support, and you should be able to get someone on the phone if you can wait a while. It's hard to tell if this product is just ramping up or is on its way out.","Some problems with CPU load, some problems with support, but nice to have all your computers covered at a reasonable price",1449100800,,

I had no problems with installation. Registration was easy too but note that Corel asks you for your email address, company name and your physical address in order to complete registration. I entered only my email address and it registered just fine so you really don't have to provide any more information than that. The activation code is located underneath the CD in the CD case.

The EULA (End User License Agreement) allows you to have WinZip 18 Pro installed on one computer at any given time. You can install it on another computer, but only if you delete it from any other computer you previously installed it on. This is not the standard 3-computer license.

WinZip 18 pro will, of course, compress and decompress files into a portable, reasonable file size. This version can compress and decompress over 25 different file formats. It will also encrypt and decrypt sensitive data, convert documents to .PDFs (even read-only .PDFs), perform back-ups and even automatically burn them to CD/DVD/Blu-Ray, embed watermarks into photos and documents, view images in a zipped file without extracting them, rotate/resize/view images at full size from within a Zip file, and a ton of other helpful capabilities. The big news about version 18 is its cloud services integration. You can use direct access to cloud services, including Box, Google Drive, SkyDrive, Dropbox, CloudMe and SugarSync, to open zip files saved in the cloud, zip files before you upload or select files from the cloud to zip and share. It's also optimized for social networking sites like FaceBook. Go to the WinZip website for a complete outline of what this version has to offer.

So why the 3 stars? My problem is that you can perform all these tasks with currently available, shareware programs for free - including compressing and decompressing files.

Norton was really the only game in town when it came to anti-virus protection.  Then came along McAfee and we had some competition.  Now there are a multitude of options out there and I have had some experience with just about all of themand to be honest I still think Norton is the best.

Reasons for that: I feel Norton still spends the most resources on updating and fighting new threats compared to others.  I have interacted with them before on a particular virus problem and they were very good and very professional.  And I believe they take very seriously all the threats that are out in the world.

360 is Nortons kind of all in one product, meaning it focuses on everything from viruses in downloads, scams in email, outside intrusions into your personal network.  The software really does try to offer a 360 degree protection for your machine.

This is a one user, three license product, meaning it is intended for one person to use on perhaps three different machines.  You basically sign up for your Norton account and you can now download the software on to three separate machines.  One desktop, two laptops; or two desktops and one laptop, you get the picture.  You can move the licenses if you need to but it is a bit of a hassle.  As uninstalling Norton is never easy.

The two biggest negative things I have to say about Norton is that, one, it is a resource hog.  You really need a somewhat up to date computer.  Anything too old or two slow and this software can cause things to come to a crawl on your computer.  You won't have any viruses, but your computer will run pretty darn slow.

The other thing I don't like is the control scheme, Norton can be really easy to use, if you let Norton do what it wants, but if you are a power user, and you like to change a lot of settings and really control what Norton does and when it does it, it is harder rather than easy.  I wish Norton would have two different interfaces.  One for regular users, and perhaps one for power users that allows easy changing or settings.

Other than those two issues I still like the product and will continue to use it.  If you have a question about the product, feel free to leave a comment below and I will try to answer it.","Not Perfect, But Still The Best",1387411200,,

This software will do it, but it takes a lot of time to figure out 'how'.

This would be the negative to this software for the novice to intermediate user.  A tough learning curve that requires weeks, if not months of learning before you feel comfortable using it.  Some would argue that this is the case with most high-end software whether it relates to animation or not.  I would tend to agree, but it can be a con for some.

The positives to this software are many.  It can be used by PC or MAC users, offers the ability to bring your drawings to life, automatically lip-syncs your audio to the drawings, and allows you to import Photoshop files.

The Character Wizard is perhaps the easiest way to get started using the Anime Studio Pro 8 software, as you'll see results quickly and with the least amount of frustration.  Experts won't care about it, but if you're buying this to have fun with your computer and/or kids, start with with wizard!

The software is feature-rich with tweaks to color schemes, brush sizes, and layers (similar to Photoshop) which was expected.  What wasn't expected was the ability to do 3D renderings to share on YouTube.  Pretty cool stuff!  The ability to upload your creations to Facebook and YouTube is a fun perk.

Advanced users will love the ability to script their own tools and add-ons for the program, but frankly, this user will never get to that point!

All the major video formats are supported, with output up to 1080p and even in 3D.

Made for professional digital artists and animation professionals, Anime Studio 8 is loaded with amazing features and delivers what it promises on that front.

If you do not fall into that category of user, you may find it overwhelmingly hard to learn anything but the basics through the wizard.  You can learn more than that on your own, but it takes time in the form of a lot of reading and hands-on trial and error.  If you're brave enough to give it a try, and can commit to learning it, you'll be rewarded.","Great software, tough learning curve",1337472000,,

This is evident from the fact that installation of Windows 7 Professional is trouble-free, and the OS is attractive, easy to figure out, and easy to configure.  It has quickly become a cliche' that Windows 7 is what Vista should have been, but it is also true.  In my installation all of my hardware peripherals (3 printers, a fax, a scanner, and numerous external hard disk drives) installed instantly and easily.  Only one of my printers required me to log onto Hewlett-Packard's website, and right there was a Windows 7 64 bit driver waiting for me.  This is one day after Windows 7 was released to the public -- Microsoft clearly worked closely with hardware developers to ensure that everything was ready to go.  Installation of all hardware went without a hiccup.  In fact, most times when you plug a device into a USB port, Win 7 automatically finds the necessary drivers and simply installs the device.

One caveat -- XP users must do a ""clean install"" from XP to Win 7.  This essentially means that if you skipped Vista (as many did) you will have to install Windows 7 and then reinstall your programs.  I did this, and it was about a two hour exercise getting everything set up the way I wanted again after installing Windows 7 64 bit.

LOOK AND FEEL.

The ""look and feel"" of Windows 7 is better than either Vista or Windows XP.  Unlike Vista, users of XP will have no difficulty finding the screens and menus they are looking for.  The new taskbar in Windows 7 is very sharp.  The user can ""pin"" any program to the taskbar for easy access.  When a program is running, the user can hover the mouse cursor over the program icon, and a mini snapshot of the actual program appears, to show what is going on with the program.  Right click on an icon on the taskbar and it will show you what files have been recently used or are open.  The new so-called ""aero"" styling of Windows 7 is very pleasant to work with.  One nice little feature is a little box at the right bottom screen--hover the mouse over it and the desktop appears without having to minimize all the open programs.

Performance wise, it is not clear that Windows 7 is wildly faster than Vista or XP.  Most users will probably think it is simply because computers are in the midst of an upgrade cycle, with more and more users using more DRAM and faster processors.  And, of course, the issue of 64 bit is emerging.

64 BIT

Windows 7 will likely lead the charge to 64 Bit software.  Windows 7 gives the option of either 32 bit or 64 bit installation, and most users are expected to opt for 64 bit.  They should.  This will not immediately impact most users, but it opens the door for much better performance in the times to come.  64 bit software running on a 64 Bit OS can access far more memory than 32 bit, which was limited to 4 GB of DRAM.  Those of us who manipulate large digital photographs, or use other processes that involve handling large amounts of data, will notice extreme performance improvements once true 64 bit programs are available.  Now that a 64 bit OS is in place, and the accompanying hardware support (fast CPUs, cheap DRAM) is available, 64 bit computing will become common; very likely within a very short time.  As always, once the capability exists, we will find new uses for them.  Digital photographers such as myself have been looking forward to 64 bit applications for a long time.

In the meantime, I have found that every single one of my 32 bit programs runs just fine in Windows 7 64 bit.  Supposedly some legacy programs have difficulties, but none of mine did.

CONCLUSION

After running Windows 7/64 for a couple of weeks, I have found essentially nothing negative about it.  It is snappier than XP, which was starting to get long in the tooth, and seems to have eliminated some of the irritants of Vista.  Most importantly, I am certain that almost all users will find that their hardware works fine on Windows 7, which was not the case with Vista.  Overall, Windows 7 is clearly a major upgrade from Vista and XP and is what Vista was supposed to be.",A home run by Microsoft -- Finally!,1257120000,52.0,

Yeah, I'm that guy.  Now that I've (finally) discovered Norton 360, I'll be spending less time with the relatives once they buy copies.

I've used Norton Internet Security for years and have recommended it often, particularly in recent years when Symantec made it run faster and leaner.  I never went for Norton 360 before receiving a review copy because frankly I couldn't really understand what it was from a quick glance.

Norton 360 does everything Norton Internet Security (NIS) does, and more, but with a different interface.

It includes firewall and antivirus protection as well as Identify Safe, identical to NIS.  (Your NIS settings and Identity Safe vault all migrate if you switch to 360 from NIS.)  Identify Safe is primarily a password manager, saving and entering your passwords for you under the protection of a single master password so that you are more likely to use appropriate, complex and site specific passwords for the web sites that you visit.

360 includes features in two areas beyond NIS:  Backup and PC Tuneup.

The PC Tuneup portion is where I jump for joy for its ability to save me from spending time cleaning up computers for friends and relatives.  It automatically does the things that I do manually to their machines, including:

1. Removal of Windows temporary files (no more searching %temp%, %tmp% and all of the other places that these things hide)

2. Removal of Internet Explorer temporary files

3. Startup Manager - controlling the many hidden programs that launch when you start your computer.  Way easier than running MSConfig, the Norton 360 Startup Manager lets you mark non-essential startup items as ""delayed"" - so that your computer starts up in a jiffy, and then these things are launched somewhat later (reported to be 5 minutes) by 360 itself.  For example, there is a Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader item in most people's startup group.  These allow Office applications and Reader to launch faster when you need them, but at the cost of slowing down the time before you get control of your mouse when you start your computer.  With 360, you get your desktop sooner - and these things can still get launched, just a little bit later.  (Or you can disable them - which has no affect on the functionality of Office or Reader - just makes them launch slower.) Etc.

4.  Registry Cleanup - the Windows Registry is a single, huge database that all software on your computer stores settings in.  The bigger and more cluttered it gets, the slower the computer runs.  360 can find entries for software that has been uninstalled and did not clean up after itself and tidy things up.

5.  Internet Explorer history cleanup - nothing special, other than it can be scheduled to run at times you choose

6.  Disk Optimization - defragmentation is essential to fast disk performance on Windows machines.  The defragger that comes with Windows itself is fine, but must be run manually.  The Norton 360 one can be scheduled to run automatically, eliminating the issue on most computers of the user either not knowing how to defrag, or continuously forgetting to do it.

All of these tune-up activities can be set on a schedule to keep things running smoothly.

Finally, 360 adds a Backup service that can backup via the internet to the ""cloud"", or to local media. This is useful and adds to the completeness of the product, but the user interface is so poor, that I take one star away in this review.

Symantec gives you 2 GB of online storage with your Norton 360 registration.  You can purchase more, but at a hefty charge relative to competitors.  You can access this storage through a Norton product or the n360.backup.com web site;  you would have to upgrade your license annually to maintain this 'cloud' backup.  But, the backup service can run automatically, incrementally uploads only files that have changed, and knows where they came from if you need to restore a file right back to its original location.  This is an excellent option for off-site backup of really important files that would make your life miserable if the disappeared in a  fire or explosion.  But, of course, it is slow to transfer large files.

Note:  your files backed up to online storage are only as secure as your Norton account login password - hackers could try to access your files via the web interface which is accessed purely with your Norton account login credentials.  And, the web interface can be outrageously slow.  It just took the site 30 seconds just to display my My Documents folder which contains a single (test) file.  On the plus side, the web interface to your online storage has a search function so that you can quickly find the file you're looking for.

You can also backup to thumb drive, optical media, a hard disk, or a network location (mapped to a drive letter).

The negative about the backup system is that  you do not have a normal Explorer-like browser tree to select or exclude the files to be backed up.  Instead you have a horrendously ugly long scrolling list of full path names to files - no enclosing folder, nothing, to make it easy to browse and find files that you want to exclude/include.  There is not one person who I help with their computer troubles who would have a slight clue as to what these long file path names mean relative to their data.  I just don't know what Symantec was thinking of, putting this in a program otherwise designed for everyday Windows users rather than tech geeks.  It is not just this list, but the whole backup process which would confuse my less techie friends and relatives - they need a wizard to lead them through the process.

One last thing I like about 360 - which is at version 5.1.0.29 as I write this (an automatic update) - is that in the Activities and Scans window, there is a checkbox to shut down the computer when activities are complete.  So, there's no excuse not to save energy when you leave the computer for the night - let 360 download updates, do backups and Tune-up activities, and then shut your computer down when it is finished.",Norton 360 is the way to go,1310601600,3.0,

You can mouse over icons on a particular date and see what was installed - software, windows updates etc. -what scans were done, what was downloaded and any threats detected.  There is also a safe web icon where you can enter and check out a URL before going there in your browser.

If you've read the other reviews here, you probably already know how annoying Vista's access control messages are, and how it was incompatible with nearly everything, so I won't spend time railing about that.  The one issue that I could not solve, or forgive, was one of the most fundamental issues for an operating system: file handling.

Vista didn't like copying files across a network.  In fact, Vista took personal umbrage at being asked to transfer files across a network, and passive-agressively reduced the transfer rate down until it could be measured in bits per minute, instead of kB per second.  I soon came to personify Vista as one of those toad-like elderly women behind the counter at the DMV who take perverse delight in watching people's impatience boil into homicidal rage.  The kind of person/operating system that will let you get to almost the front of a two-hour line/95% complete file transfer and then wordlessly put up a ""Next Window"" sign/""File I/O error"" message with just the hint of a malicious grin.  The kind of person/operating system that justifies the ""No Firearms in the DMV""/""Don't keep a hammer near your laptop with Vista installed on it"" rule.

The problem wasn't just limited to network file copies, either.  Copying photos from a USB flash drive to the hard drive took so long that I could have recreated them in MS Paint, pixel by pixel, more quickly and with less frustration.  Where else but in Vista will you see a dialog box with the words ""0.2 of 4 Mb copied, 240 hours remaining""?

My experience with Vista was so abominable that I swore never to give Microsoft another dime of my business, walked to the Apple store, and plunked down way to much money for a Macbook Pro.  OSX has its issues, some of them serious, but OSX makes Vista look like Microsoft literally implemented the ""1,000,000 monkeys with 1,000,000 copies of C++ will probably turn out a well-made operating system"" rule, but decided to save money by giving about 200 monkeys 3 computers and one copy of Q-BASIC.",Finally drove me into the arms of Apple,1257379200,4.0,

For me (someone who understands the ideas of accounting, P&L, gross vs. net etc., but does NOT have professional bookkeeping experience), the simplicity of QuickBooks, its easier transaction editing and reporting, and its use of (mostly) real-world terminology was what I wanted in an accounting package. The more professional packages were just a bit too confusing for non-accountant me.

However, times have changed. It's no surprise that if you are more comfortable with traditional bookkeeping techniques, or require a more robust feature set, Sage 50 (which used to be Peachtree) may be the way to go; what is a surprise is that Sage 50 is now accessible enough to an average business person that I'm comfortable with it.

The terminology and setup in Sage 50 are more traditional (from a professional bookkeepers perspective) than QB's, which means when my accountant asks for something specific I can deliver it without translating his request into QuickBooks terminology.

And the feature set on the Premium edition of Sage 50 is excellent. Inventory support includes Average, FIFO, LIFO unit-specific costing. You're also allowed up to 10 pricing levels per item, which is HUGELY useful to me as I manufacture and sell at both retail and wholesale levels to multiple customers with varying discounts.

Reporting is excellent, and there's more customization available in the dashboard as well as in reports. Invoices, order, and other forms are also customizable.

After some time with Sage 50 I've found I like it better than QuickBooks. I prefer the interface, I like the customizable dashboard, I prefer the inventory options, and love the multi-level pricing. I'm also a bit burned out on QuickBooks' business policies: too much advertising within the program, features that I think should be there that need to be purchased (or don't exist), buggy operation at times and poor (in my experience) technical support (on that last topic, I have NOT called Sage for tech support but HAVE heard good things about them).

A few years ago, the useability gap between QuickBooks and the more ""professional"" accounting programs was quite large: large enough that I always worked with QuickBooks. With this version of Sage 50 though, that gap has closed enough that I've found it may be worth the time it takes to relearn a few things to be able to use what feels to me like a more robust, more professional solution.

After installing from the disk, the activation code did not work and the product was not responding.  So I had to call tech support.  I was told that I would have to uninstall what I already had done and then go to their website and download the product and use a new activation code.  They sent me email which I printed out with the instructions.  I noticed that the directions in the email contained erroneous selections.(nice job).  Also I realized that I had installed the software while my anti-virus program was running (I don't know if this caused any problem or not).  So I turned off my anti-virus program and installed the downloaded software.  I was able to register it then.  The directions in the manual do not specify whether to turn off anti-virus before installation. Are customers just supposed to guess at this?  I would think that telling people about that would lessen the work load of their tech support.

This product is supposedly very good at finding spyware that other products do not but, it is a lot slower.  My first full scan is going on 2 hours and it says file scan 58% done total progress 28%.  Also it says ""no threats detected so far"" which is a good thing.  I try to keep my computer cleaned up.  I was told in the email that when the first full scan finishes I am then supposed to restart the computer and run a full scan again.  My experience is this software is taking a really long time to install and get my first scan results....hours and hours.....still scanning.......

Customer service technicians were friendly and helpful but, could not explain my first registration problem.  Also they did not mention anti-virus problems during installation.....I had to bring up that possibility.

The low price should not be a consideration in determining whether or not to buy this product. Efficiency, or lack of it would be the most important determinate.

I would never recommend this software, there are others that have smoother installation/registration.","Problem Installation, Slow Scanning",1231891200,2.0,

Unfortunately, Pinnacle Studio 19 isn't that editor.

First, as other reviewers have mentioned, you're required to install this program on your boot drive. I have multiple drives which I use for my main drive, app drive, games, etc. Forcing me to install on my boot drive is ridiculous and limiting. I contacted support and this was confirmed...

I normally use CyberLink PowerDirector for my video editing, which, for the most part, has been fine for my needs. Pinnacle Studio's interface is very familiar coming from PowerDirector, so I was able to get editing pretty quickly. I immediately noticed that various features seemed more cumbersome to access. Outside of simply dragging and dropping video clips, it seems all other features require one or two extra clicks compared to PowerDirector, which I found slowed me down considerably.

My biggest complaint would have to be the stability... on the very first project, I spent about 15 minutes putting a video together (about 12gb), saved it, then tried to render it only to have the program crash. I restarted my computer, opened Pinnacle Studio back up, reloaded my project, and again, once I tried rendering, it crashed. I was able to render it only after starting from scratch and doing the exact same thing...

Since then, it's crashed quite a few times, to my frustration, since the crashes seem to corrupt the project I'm working on. I tried using the on my wife's laptop, with the same results.

This install was an upgrade from PP12 because it had been reinstalled too many times, causing blockage by Nuance.  I could have called them again but it was time to get the latest version.

I am a home user, who started with PagesPro then a Xerox product.  I like the product, particularly the image printing to PDF and the PDF editing features.  I use them regularly.

Unfortunately, with this edition, after a clean re-install of WIN7 Pro 64-bit the image printer driver refused to install -- the main program installed fine.  I called Nuance support, no 800 number available, was on hold forever and the best they could do was say try reinstalling with the firewall and anti-virus disabled.  That made no sense, the main program was installed and registered.

My  problem was with the printer driver install only.  There are a lot of us with that problem.  I read their posts.  I tried many workarounds with no meaningful help from Nuance.  Finally, I found a utility in the image printer driver's program folder for reinstalling the printer driver after an OS upgrade -  WORKED LIKE A CHAMP. To bad Nuance did not know enough to tell me to try it.

ALSO, there is a known bug in the standard version of PP14's update program.  It does not report any update!  There are many workarounds on the web for that as well, however, none worked for me.

Meeks Jr.,"Tiffen's DFX is a collection of filters that emulate different film processing types, lenses and other photographic effects. Many of the filters are high quality, producing convincing effects. The fog effect, for instance, does a credible job of adding a soft mist to an image.

All the included filters (which there are many of them) are accessed through a ""strip"" that runs along the bottom of the window for the App. Clicking on an effect brings up a tiled set of variations on that filter that can be quickly selected and previewed - much like the old ""variations"" panel in Photoshop. In addition, the presets can be further configured through a ""parameters"" tab, which greatly expands the functionality of these filters. On top of this, filters can be ""stacked"" in layers.

Masks are simple to do, and there are several ways to create them, including gradient, selection tool and a line select mode. As with the filters, you can have multiple masks, which can easily be tweaked through a bar that runs along the top of the window.

For those used to Instagram type of filters, this software will present a challenge, since it reaches far beyond applying the stock ""vintage lomo-esque"" type of effects. Some of the effects are extremely useful, some are sheer novelty (night vision) which will probably only be used once in a great while.

One final note concerning installation on a Mac. The software comes on a CD with a .exe file for installing the software on Windows. But for the Mac, there is a zip file that has to be copied off of the disk, and then unpacked. At that point you mount a disk image, which contains the installer. It would have been simpler to at least gotten rid of the dumb step which requires copying the zip file to the Mac before installing. Note that one installer is used for all variations of the DFX software (including the plugin for Photoshop), so be sure to pick the right one for the software you have a license for - although you can still install versions you don't have a license for, and run them in a limited time trial mode.

- Editing Masks
- Graphic overlays
- Color correction & brightness
- White balance & tone adjustments (very useful for indoor photography)
- Video rotation
- Ability to add flash animations to your video
- Chroma key functions
- Surround sound mixing
- Stretching audio duration

From my tests and reading of the manual these functions seem to be relatively easy to use.  However, the quality of the program is always found in the production process and the final output.

To test VideoStudio Pro X2 I imported a 30 minute avi file and had VideoStudio segment this clip into segments.  Next, I placed these segments onto the storyboard and cut out a few unwanted clips at the start and end of video.  Next, I trimmed the opening and ending clips using the clip trim handles.  Finally, I applied an audio fade at the end of the video and burned the production to a dvd.  All of these functions worked perfectly and quickly on a Pentium 4, 3ghz machine with 3 gigabytes of ram.  Impressive!

However, VideoStudio does exhibit some unstable behavior upon exiting the program. VideoStudio has given me a couple error messages upon shutdown.  Strangely, neither of these error messages affected the editing and production process.  My guess is that VideoStudio is not fully releasing the memory it was occupying.

Corel is close to having a class defining video editor.  Hopefully, Corel will issue an update to fix some of the small but irritating bugs.

This flexibility is a threshold requirement these days and Pinnacle Studio is definitely up to speed.

The editing process is simple but powerful.  I've used several different home editing suites and always come back to Pinnacle due to the simplicity of the on-screen interface and controls.  I'm able to make great-looking videos that get lots of ""wow - how did you do that?"" comments without having to fumble around indefinitely figuring out how to do this transition or drop in that graphic.  That, coupled with its affordability make it a great choice for anyone looking to quickly make family movies, team highlight reels, etc.

Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.
Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.
Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.
Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with ""Clear Type"" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.
PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.
This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.
Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great. Compatibility goes back to Publisher 2000, which is a draw back for users who might be using Publisher 98 or under.

The price was so low (compared to Adobe Illustrator, the only competition) that examples of Corel would show up in ordinary office documents, like the ""Word-Art"" equivalents as headlines.

But that was then. Nowadays Corel is, unfortunately, a second-string company, eclipsed by the Adobe Empire. But also the market has changed. There are millions of digital photographers, seduced by the promise of ""No developing - pictures immediately."" That's a market that's served by plenty of programs these days, and it's not as easy as it once was to make a name for yourself.

The market has several free and low-cost options which are simplified versions of major programs like Photoshop. Photoshop is my weapon of choice, but I'd be the first to admit that it's way too complicated for the average snap-shooter to understand. In many cases people just want to remove red-eye from flash, and have some easy way to sort their pictures.

Even Photoshop Elements is over the heads of many users, so the best choice for one's mythical ""grandparents"" are those free and low-cost programs for under $50. There are numerous options, including photo manipulating programs that come for free to download, or free with an operating system or camera. To succeed in this area a program will have to be better than the others.

Unfortunately Corel Paint Shop Photo Express just isn't different enough. Other reviewers have compared it to Picasa (free) and other cheap options. The interface simplifies tasks, but so do the interface in many similar programs. Free programs like Windows Live Photo Gallery and Picasa have advanced features like face recognition, which I couldn't find in the Corel offering.

So why is Corel's offering here? My only guess is that some unscrupulous salespeople in the big electronic stores will mention to a new purchaser of a Windows 7 computer that ""it doesn't come with Photo-Editing software."" They then point the buyer to a row of Photo-Editing software that they can sell to the unsuspecting, because you can download Windows Live Photo Gallery from Microsoft for free. It's not in Windows 7 so that other companies can get a shot at this market, but I think you'll find that the Microsoft offering is better than Corel's.

So, sorry, yet another voice against this program. A pity, because I would have like Corel to do well, but it didn't happen in this case.","Too little, too late",1261958400,,

  System boot-up times will be extended by a factor of two or three. Just the thing you want when starting up your computer - a nice long wait. A really long wait.

  And if that wasn't enough fun, wait until you launch your web browser. All those hours programmers spent trying to build fast response into their browser creations? Wasted effor. Norton Internet Security 2008 helps your browser pass away minute after minute after minute. You had no better use for your time anyway, did you? Norton Internet Security 2008 will slow your browser to a crawl.

  Norton Internet Security 2008 will interrrupt you at least twice a day (and generally more) with an intrusive pop-up that new updates have been downloaded and that you need to restart your computer. Oh, how nice: they five you an option of being reminded in 1, 12 or 24 hours - but apparently no option to set the update schedule or turn off the annoying pop-ups. Symanytec's program architects certainly think that the user is not only clueless, but their slave as well.

  Symantec has included a ""feature"" they call ""Identity Safe"". Every time you type in a password to a site it launches an annoying pop-up asking if you want to use ""Identity Safe"". You can click on the convenient ""Do not show this window again"" option a thousand times - and it will ignore you a thousand times. Norton Internet Security 2008 also grabs web browser tool bar space, but fortunately you can turn it off.

  Does the product work for its intended purpose? That I don't know yet. I didn't have any viruses on my machine before I installed Norton Internet Security 2008 and it hasn't reported any.

I loved art class in school because I had a whole room full of supplies, though I hated cleaning up. I was really looking forward to using this software because it simulates all of that messy stuff which is fun to use but not convenient. Fun times ahead!

It's mostly a fairly straightforward painting/editing program, but it has a whole ton of ""brushes"", both simulated real art tools (paint brushes, pens, spatulas, airbrushing, etc) and some wacky fun stuff like the ""image hose"" which lays down a trail of objects. If you're a skilled hand artist, or planning to become one, many of the brush types will be very useful in creating digital images which do look very much like they were created with brush, pen, or sponge strokes.

However, for what I expected to be a pretty high-end piece of software, I was disappointed with some quirks.

To avoid using the word ""tool"" (often used to refer to editing tools) and also avoid calling everything a ""brush"", I will refer to all simulated things as implements.

Some of the implements are too perfect and constant, and obvious patterns show. The ""loaded palette knife 2"" strokes with a pattern you might expect from a scraping painter's knife, but it NEVER CHANGES, down to the pixel. And unlike some of the other implements, there's no rounding or smoothing of the stroke to make it look convincing. It's exactly what you would get by copying and dragging a row of pixels in a paint program on an old DOS box. See the uploaded image, it's loaded with patterned artifacts. Utterly useless. Some others had similar problems, but I remembered this knife as the worst.

Some implements which rotate to match the stroke direction have a similar problem. They are completely 2-dimensional, and while they make delightful swirls of texture, they ALWAYS start and end with a completely flat row of pixels, just as no object in the univers would if used to draw. Again, it looks like the obvious result of a paint program.

One feature I was initially happy to see is the ability to zoom in with the mouse's scroll wheel. Why that isn't universal I have no idea, and being a detail hawk I am constantly zooming in and out at various points. Great! But it's silly, because using your scroll wheel will only zoom in to the exact center of your screen. The program doesn't care where your cursor is! So you have to first drag over to center whatever area you want to zoom in on. How did they not think to make it zoom in on the area I am pointing at? Yes, I can drag to the area first, but zooming in & out is something I might do literally hundreds of times while working on one image.

I was not able to figure out why trying to pick the crop tool sometimes jumps my focus down to the canvass layer, which is surely the last layer anyone would want to crop and move. Unlike some other things, there was no popup telling me why it didn't want to let me crop the paint layer.

Here's another silly thing. The escape key does not un-select things. If you use the select tool, and have the dotted box around an area then either perform some action or change your mind, you want to un-select the area. In every other program I have used, either ESC or ENTER will unselect the area and let you move on with your life, which is handy because you can draw with your right hand and hit keys like that with your left. In Corel, you have to use the ""reset tool"" on the menu bar. Again, it might not seem like a big deal but it interrupts the flow of an action you might do hundreds of times while working on a serious project. And it's not like the ESC key does anything else.

And finally, though the number of tools is impressive at first, it's all about buying upgrades. Want more brushes? Hand over a chunk of cash. It looks like the ""image hose"" is the same, and you can only use leaves and tires so many times before your work looks like a child got on your computer when you weren't there.  When the program first started, this really convenient learning interface popped up. Oh good, something to get me started! Not really, they're all ""30 lecture"" bundles you have to buy. No free 5-minute intro to using Corel's mediocre interface.

Overall, it's got some good stuff. But don't think you're buying into some great thing.

Works seemed to find non existent problems and used lots of resources. Since Norton Anti-Virus cost just about the same price as Systems works did I opted for one of the free anti-virus programs (Avast) and was very happy. I also have a Mac and use no Norton software on it.

Recently I obtained a new HP Vista computer and was happily running Avast on it with no problems. But I missed several programs I had on my XP system that did things like defrag my hard drive, keep track of my passwords, etc. So when this program became available in the Amazon Vine program and I noticed it had those separate programs that I had by other companies now incorporated all into one program called Norton 360 I decided to give it a try.

I had no problem loading the software and it seemed to configure effortlessly upon it's first start up. I've used all of the features on it thus far except the backup program. I am unclear as if the backup only works to the skimpy on-line disc space that comes with the product (more can be rented for what seems a fairly astronomical price). The features of the program seem to work well so far in all the areas I have tried.

I've read many of the other reviews for this program and it seems I may be praising it too soon since I've only had it installed about 3 weeks so far (on a 6 week old PC) and it seems that things begin to go sour shortly after that - we'll see. I would agree that it seems to work best with new computers with fresh Vista installations (Ultimate version in my case on a 6 week old PC). It seems to incur all sorts of problems on older systems with Vista upgrades.

So I'm taking a cautious approach and think that it's an average program that tries to do a lot, and if you have  the need or desire for these features and a fairly new computer it will probably work well for you.

Given the mass of ""instant satisfaction"" commercials on tv, it's easy to write this product off as another one of those scams to relieve people of their hard earned money.  It was sort of with this attitude that I approached Rosetta Stone.  I've had a mild interest in Japanese for some time and so, decided to take the plunge with the Japanese version of Rosetta Stone.

Rosetta Stone comes with the software for installation on a computer, audio cds for use to practice while on the go as well as a headset for use with the software itself. Installing the program is easy enough, and then one gets into the nitty gritty of using it. The program is fairly well laid out and intuitive and it's easy to get started.

As others have described, Rosetta Stone's main goal is to encourage users to speak the language actively.  Immersion is undoubtedly the most effective way to learn a language as it forces the speaker to use the language and converse in it under practical circumstances. As one who's taken a few language courses in my time, I can say that while book study has its uses, to actually learn a language for practical use, speaking and hearing it is absolutely vital.

Rosetta Stone attempts to get as close to that experiance as possible with its teaching style. Do do this, it uses images, spoke words and a return responce method. The user speaks into a microphone to respond and the program has the facility to ""listen"" to one's pronunciation and correct it when off.  For a tonal language such as Japanese, pronunciation is absolutely vital to avoid translation errors.

The Rosetta Stone method is quite effective in helping to train a person's mouth to make the correct sounds and get used to saying the words. Japanese is a language quite unlike English, so this is a real benefit of the program. I found that it really did work in helping me retain vocabulary, though I did struggle at times.  The progam is fairly well designed from a flow standpoint, with various lessons occasionally repeating themselves as you progress to help reinforce retention of the material.

In the end it's not a perfect method, but for the self studier, it isn't terrible.  The down side is that Rosetta stone uses a call responce method and so a person does not get the conversational experiance that builds confidence and teaches in its own right. Practical conversation is unexpected and fluid, something that a computer program cannot emulate. I could see that this program would be a godsend if used in conjunction with actual classes where one could practically apply what they've learned. Repeating rote phrases is a lot different than actually speaking.

Another thing I noticed is that Rosetta Stone's focus on speaking actually has a downside in that it seems a bit weak on teaching proper grammer. It uses the language method of teaching by showing differences in gender and verb conjugations and the like as you go through lessons, but it's not very deep and a lot of it is inferred. For someone like myself who has taken numerous language classes over the years, I was left wondering if learning vocabulary and grammer in this way was really enough. Given that all I know about Japanese is what I was taught by Rosetta Stone, it's hard for me to say.

The use of Japanese characters is another aspect of this program that threw me. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers here and studied some of the Hiragana on my own to avoid using Romaji (latinized written japanese). It was good advice.

A word to the wise, this is a pretty in depth program. While commercials and the like seem to imply that this is the ""easy"" way to learn a language, it's like any other method of learning a language. It's work and a real investment of time. Daily study will make this program its most effective and probably push a student deeper into the language than basic classes would.  But it's likely to take months rather than weeks to progress to the point where one has a deeper grasp of the language.

I didn't use the language CD's (which cover the lessons in the program), but I could see that if someone was in a hurry to learn even more quickly, these might be quite useful for usewhile in the car on the go.

From personal experiance, I learned more Japanese more quickly from this program in a couple months than a comparative spanish when taking a couple years of that language.  That's saying something.",The next best thing to immersion and classes,1234137600,,

But as a long time user of Dragon, the updates aren't exactly mind blowing.  The Dragon toolbar, the better integration with apps, etc. is all fine and good but it's just slight.  The only compelling reason I've found is that the Windows 8 computer seems to work better somewhat.  But if you're using Dragon 12 on Windows 8 fine then you probably aren't using the features that you'd notice.

If you're totally new to Dragon NaturallySpeaking, it's an excellent piece of software that will translate your words into text.  The newest versions even allow mouse control.  (I know that 12 also did this.)  So you can go totally hands-free.  Just find a quiet space to work, configure it to your voice and away you go without using your hands at all.  I do find that it's easier to do without others in the room and I have not had great experiences trying the software on the bus/train/coffee shop.  Plus talking to your computer does tend to make others stare at you.  But at home or in an office it's great.  I've also been able to record to a recorder and then input into Dragon, but it's less successful than live voice into Dragon.  I've tried a few recorders and it always suffers from ambient sound noise.  A laptop just seems to work better for me than recorders.

I've used this software for dozens of setups for those with disabilities and injuries.  It's amazing how productive you can be without the use of your hands.  A very, very small investment to save your wrists.  And you really don't have to tweak this version much at all to get it to recognize your voice.  I really love it.  One key is to use an accurate microphone.  I use the Sennheiser ME 3-EW headset EW microphone http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-ME-3-EW-headset-microphone/dp/B002FOFW52/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1410457352&sr=8-16&keywords=dragon+microphone right now and it's great.  But there are cheaper alternatives that appear to be just as good.

Basically Dragon is very similar to Adobe Acrobat Pro in that it's a wonderful application that works.  But it's not one that you really need to upgrade every year.  If you aren't using Dragon now and want hands-free computing then this is what you need.  I will say that I've always found the Premium version to be worth the extra investment, no matter what version I got.  The Home versions are just too limited IMHO.

While there are other players such as VLC which are more affordable (free!), there are Blu-ray discs that VLC can not play.  For example, I could not play Spectre using VLC, but PowerDVD played the disc without hesitation.

Setup
Cyberlink learned from the complaints about version 14 and now you are asked if you would like to associate video, music or images with PowerDVD.  A choice of extension for each media type like how VLC does it would have been nice, but at least you can choose what types of files you want to associate with the program.

Upon start, the program begins scanning your computer for images, music and videos.  To stop the program from snooping through your files in each of media files, you need to under settings / preferences / media library and there you can select the folders that PowerDVD will scan.  To stop the scan, simply remove the folders from the library.  I can understand why the authors would set the program to scan common directories without first asking, but I wish that there was a better way to stop the scanning if you didn't want it to happen.

PC vs TV
One of the first screens that pops up when you start the program is a screen that gives you a choice between PC mode and TV mode.  Both have the same functionality, but the two modes present the menus differently.  PC mode is the classic interface with lots of options and menus.  The TV mode has much simpler menus to reduce screen clutter to make it easier to navigate.  The interface in both cases is smooth and easy to navigate.

Library
The media library is a very nice feature.  The user interface looks clean and handles smoothly.  There are also options to customize the interface.

The photo viewer handled different file types and perusing through images files is much smoother and faster than with the Windows Photo Viewer, for example.  Having all of the video files in one place is very convenient.

There is the option to use YouTube and Vimeo files within the library as well which is a nice feature.

Media Support
The ultra version of PowerDVD 16 is the only one of the three versions that includes Blu-ray 3D Disc support.

Casting
A nice feature is media-casting support which allows you to stream audio and video to Apple TV, Roku, and Chromecast devices on your network.  However, for this to work you must have one of these devices and it doesnt work with Blu-ray discs.

Performance
I played mkv, m4v and avi files with both PowerDVD and the free VLC player.  Both handled the different files types competently.  The video enhancement features of PowerDVD were set to sharpen detail, enhance lighting and optimize color (50%) and to enhance audio (50%).  I didn't seem much of a difference when playing both players side by side on my computer (see the image that I have uploaded of the comparison).

I found the playback of Blu-ray discs to be very nice but not spectacular.  However, for discs like Spectre neither the VLC player nor Blu-ray player that came with Nero 12 could decode the disc whereas PowerDVD did it with ease.

Power DVD allows you to change the enhancement features and to play side to side versions of the same image so that you can see the effect which is a very nice feature so that you can tweak the enhancements to get them just as you want them.

Overall
Is it worth investing in PowerDVD if other programs such as VLC handles videos or Windows Photo Viewer allows you to scroll through photos?  The interface of PowerDVD is much slicker than the other programs and PowerDVD can handle a lot of different files types.  What makes PowerDVD better is the support of Blu-ray discs, especially 3D discs and the video and audio enhancements that the program offers.  Plus you don't have to worry about tweaking the program to make it play certain discs.  PowerDVD handles them all.

This release does not offer any ground-breaking changes in functionality. It has the same, familiar interface and guided instruction that has been honed over the years. My needs are relatively simple, no complicated multi-rental properties or other investments. The user has the option of simplifying the process by having Turbotax only present options that it feels are relevant to the preparation of the return, or the user can opt for a more thorough tour of all options (which is what I do). When there is a question about a particular deduction, the software's help is often clear and unambiguous. Installing and updating the software from one year to the next is simple, it easily imports data from the previous year to speed the process of preparation. The software will periodically update itself, which it did when I first installed the software. The updating process went without a hitch.

Last year I prepared a return for a friend using their copy of Turbotax, and when I received the final amount owed, it seemed wrong. We took all the pertinent documentation to a tax preparer, and had them do the return. In the end, they came back with the same numbers, save for one very obscure deduction which was only available for one year, and would have been easy to miss. It did little to change the overall amount though, so it further reinforced my confidence in the software. Old releases (back to 2007) continue to work on the Mac, if it is necessary to go back that far, which is impressive. I am looking forward to using it to prepare this year's (2015) return.","No Surprises, Same Well Designed Interface",1449532800,,

BACKGROUND:  I've used Paint Shop Pro for years.  In fact, I began using PSP back in the days of Compuserve when I could download a few shareware programs and my employer paid for any that I wanted to keep.  I'm not a graphics artist, but when I need to do any kind of image editing, I can usually find my way around in PSP to do what I need to do.

WHAT I LIKE:

- Installed easily, boots up without issues
- Seems speedy for the amateur that I am
- Has a full set of functions and features

WHAT COULD BE BETTER

In the old days, making a simple web graphic was easy to do.  PSP is so sophisticated now as a Photoshop replacement, it's sometimes not easy to create a simple graphic.  I wish that there were a rich set of wizard functions that would start with a goal in mind, and then have the wizard walk through all the steps involved.  Sometimes I have a simple goal in mind, but it's hard to know where to begin.

This is the third of four programs (each offering something more) offered by Norton to protect computers. There is Norton Antivirus, Norton Internet Security, Norton 360 and Norton 360 Multi-Deivice.  Norton 360 Multi-Device allows you to add protection to smart phones and tablets as well as computers. Norton also has a line of mobile and tablet security.

Once you purchase this you get a one year subscription. After the year is up you can either buy another year of service from Norton or buy the product from a third party like Amazon. In my case I was given the opportunity to review this for free through the Vine program so jumped at the chance to do so.

One of the nice features with Norton is that once installed it will always update to the latest version of the software you purchased. As a result of this there is no pressure to try the new and improved version because you are getting the newest version of the software you purchased.

When you press the Norton icon you get a screen that has security, identity, backup and tuneup options.  Each option gives you a number of choices such as when to run scans or updates or how to manage identity protection. It is easy to use and ideal for people who are not computer experts.

Norton Safe Search will also appear when I search the Internet.  There is a search box and if you go through it Norton will let you know if a site is safe or not.

One of the things I like about Norton is there is 24 hour live free technical support available for issues with installation or product use in general. I had an issue this year that may have been virus related and I called technical support. The agent addressed my concern and thankfully it was not a virus issue.

Over the past year I have had a couple of warnings that a virus had been blocked.  I have yet to have a virus problem in the years I have been using Norton products.

When you buy a Norton product you get 365 days of updates to keep your computer protected from the latest spyware and virus threats.  I had four months of my subscription left and a Norton agent was able to add that to the year that came with this product.

When I first started using Norton many years ago I would use additional programs for added protection against spyware. I just use Norton now. I am confident that it will protect my computer from virus or spyware issues. Additionally when scans are running I can still work on my computer without everything slowing down.

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).","Expensive, but worth it! painless and powerful",1099440000,,

In fact, I cannot tell that there is a single improvement over prior editions.  I think Intuit is milking this product for profit rather than investing in it.

For example, for corporations, the Form 1120 defaults to assuming that someone owns 20% or more of the firm, forcing the listing of such people on a form G.  As in years past, you must switch to forms mode, uncheck the box (never offered in the interview) that says someone owns more than 20% of the firm, and then manually delete the G.

The most infuriating thing about the 1120 is that as of yesterday, March 13, you could neither print nor e-file the return - which is due on March 15 (!) - because the TurboTax forms were out of date.  Yet, the iRS released the final 1120 forms on March 1.  How could it possibly take a vastly capitalized corporation like Intuit more than a day to make whatever minor adjustments were in the final forms?  TurboTax did update itself today, March 14, to allow for filing.  Infuriatingly last-minute nonsense.

When e-filing the 1120 today, now that the forms are available, I chose ACH debit (as opposed to EFTPS) to pay the tax due.  On the confirmation screen, TurboTax confirmed that I selected EFTPS (not) with an edit button to change it - clicking the Edit button took me back to the screen showing ACH and the bank routing/account numbers/etc.  Just one of a dozen or more glitchy buggy things.

A cosmetic bug, but one that is disconcerting, is a screen under Federal Review that just says ""This is Heading Text / This is a Subheading""  (screenshot posted with product images above).  Clicking the Federal Review tab again gets the correct page, but, really.

For trusts filing 1041, expenses allocated to income are still not allocated, by default, to interest and dividends (etc) by pro-ration, as is done by most tax preparers, not is there a question or checkbox in the interview to allow for that.  As in years past, all expenses are subtracted against interest, fully, first, then dividends/other income.  You have to switch to forms mode and find the checkbox to manually check to do the allocation as desired.  K-1 allocations are also not complete, with Foreign Tax credit not properly allocated to the beneficiary.

These are just a few of the issues in this clunky, never-improved, Intuit cash-cow.  For folks who are not tax nerds, you should have any return that is prepared by this software reviewed by a tax professional.

I have used Norton Internet security, and then Norton 360 for years; it has served me very well. the 360 is very comprehensive as an antivirus and Network plus a password manager. It also has a feature when you do a search, for instance, to see which sites are safe, and which are known to be malicious, and shown with a green (safe) or Red (danger) icon next to the link.

 The upgrade procedure is a nightmare if you are trying to install it on to your PC as an upgrade, especially if you want to carry over remaining days from your current subscription of the regular Norton 360. quite a few reviewers here have complained about the same issue. The Amazon download purchase of this product gives you a link to Symantec's website, where you enter your logon credentials, and the registration Key into the form. So far, no problem. The norton downloader installs, which then downoads the Norton 360 Premiere install file. When it is done, it says it is complete, and you are given the option to activate it, which again askes you for your registation key. When you enter it, it gives you an error that it is for the incorrect product. Everybody has complained on this, and I thought I would be more successful, lol.
You wind up closing the window, and looking at your current Norton 360, and see no change, so you click on the upgrade link, where you can enter the reg key: same error. You look into the folder where the downoad went into (Premiere NEVER DID install) and double click the file, which then actually does something and tells you that it needs to first uninstall the old 360, and also gives your the very wise opportunity to save your user settings, like your password vault first. you reboot your PC, and all you wind up with is (No new Norton 360 Premiere), a little icon in the taskbar for the password vault. So you install it again from the downloaded install file and it is successful, and asks for the reg key once more.

Now, how do you get your remaining days back from your ""old"" subscription? You go on Norton's web site and finally find out how to start a Chat session, enter your info, and get put into the Chat que. I was number 104 in line to start. It took about 45 minutes to get a rep on the chat session.  I actually put this paragraph in the wrong place..  Before I even went to start the download and upgrade, I went to Chat first to be told the correct procedure, and the rep only said that before he can carry over the remaining days, I must first install and activate the Premiere product. He actually never told me HOW to do the above correctly.
He also gave me a case number to use after I activated the new product, so I could continue afterwards and get the days transferred. I did that this morning, and it took another 40 minutes to go from #44 in the que to chat with a rep. He got it done for me no problem.
So I have 2 more PC's to do this to, and it whould work out easy I hope.

I hate to sound like I'm bitchy and whiney, normally I'm not, but this really got to me. If only the instructions were clear and accurate.
If you have no previous product to upgrsade from, you should have no problem. Others here have advised to uninstall the old product first, but I thought I was smarter than them. Well, I AM NOT, lol.

Now WHY did I not wait untill my old product subscription expired? Because I wanted to make sure the reg key I got was valid and worked. The others were right. Uninstall the old product FIRST.

Still after all my complaining, I give the Nortonn 360 Premiere PRODUCT itself 5 stars. The installation/upgrade process: If it were possible, I;d give it a minus 10.

Let me start by saying I'm a Systems Administrator and we use other big names and those virus protection programs are bloated and put heavy processor loads on the systems they protect. Because of my experience with McAffe and Norton I chose not to run those at home and instead used the free version of AVG's product.

What I found was that AVG was a low demand scanner. In other words unlike most other virus programs you really don't know this one is there, and it has what I would say is a better anti virus engine then the big names.

So why buy this version rather then get the free version? This version is a 2 year subscription and while the free does antivirus scanning there are a lot of ""features"" that are well worth the cost, and with so much spyware/adware trying to sneak into your Windows PC's these days you really need a top notch program protecting your PC and your sensitive data.

AVE has done a great job in their anti-spyware scanner, and they have a linkscanner which is very useful. In fact they have this on their free version as the AVG Toolbar for your internet browser. It tells you which links are safe, which are known threats and which ones you should be cautious with.

So while a lot of the 'unique"" features are in the free version, the paid has the added protection of adware/spyware which really these days its more likely you get spyware/adware over a virus so you really need the protection. And from my experience with the big name companies and AVG I have always opted to choose AVG. It's what I run at home and have total confidence in and love the fact you never even know it's there except for the icons running in the task bar.

Will this OS be intalled onto a laptop or desktop? Is it networked? Will I use this for ""business type applications"" or ""personal type applications""? Do I need strong multimedia capabilities?
Windows 2000 Professional is an extremely stable OS. After running it for almost two weeks non-stop, I never had a single problem. Crashes and the infamous ""blue screen of death"" became obsolete things of the past (unless you're using ME). As long as I did what the OS told me, for example not installing unsigned drivers, the OS behaved the way I wanted it to.
Windows 2000 is also an excellent machine for networking, which is simplified by helpful wizards that will guide even a novice through. Because it is so simple to accomplish, this is a favorite OS for laptop users and businesses.
Windows 2000 lacks multimedia capabilities found in Windows ME. Some very simplistic multimedia functions are lost in this OS... If you are finding a gaming system, this is NOT it. Another downfall is that many of the drivers are special for 2000, because it lacks the DOS background in ME. This is very similar to XP. Do not worry about this problem however, because almost all equipment will have 2000 drivers.
Finally, Windows 2000 looks a lot like ME, making it convenient for an individual who is used to the 9x/ME environment to convert over to the 2000 environment, without crossing over the problems of ME.

difficult to know where to begin. But here are three:

1) ACTIVATION: The most annoying. Companies resort to this because
otherwise people would be handing disks out to all their friends and

2) INSTABILITY: Decide you don't like it? Removing it requires a number of reboots and manual deletion of files and folders. You'll also have to go into the registry and remove the sloppy leftovers. Yuck.

3) RESOURCES: Taxes your system's resources. Instead of buying a suite, get a defragger, get a registry cleaner, and get them without the pesky activation. These things are designed by committee.

Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.

Just ONE Please...:
This item has licensing for just ONE Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) or Android device. If you ONLY have one device this is fine, but if you have even two you are much better getting the 5 device version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security/dp/B00MHZ6Z64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security</a>&nbsp;or 10 device&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;which should be enough for many families.

Whether you get the 1, 5 or 10 device license version it is the same product. Depending on the device there are differing feature sets. For example, IOS devices get no antivirus. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Windows Setup:
Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is hard to find in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me until I finally found it deep in the settings.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:
I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox was unable to start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). This virtual machine is critical to my business so I was happy to finally resolve this. This is the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.

NOTE: As of Late February Virtual Box seems to work fine again with the mainstream releases IF you disable Norton Security during installation.

How About Norton Security WITH Backup:
If you want an integrated on-line backup solution or have more than 5 devices, you might want to consider getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;it supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. The difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.

Mobile Support:
The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a over a mile away from its actual location!!
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number...
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty poor. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:
This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good overall but has some issues. It finds things other antivirus solutions on my Windows 7 Pro PC did not and does not seem to slow things down for me. I had one application with a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but buries the advanced controls deep in the settings.

Overall Norton Security should be a good tradeoff for most home users.

The ONE device license is not a bargain. These days, who has just one device?

The software itself is a great product for most people. If you have more than 1 device get the 5 device version or the 10 device version if more than 5 or you want backup too.

Because of the minor issues and relatively poor value compared to the multi-device Norton Security versions I'm giving Norton Security for 1 device just 3 stars.

I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!
  I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a ""power user,"" especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.
  One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable.  For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available.  Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!
  In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable!  You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.
  The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it ""thinks"" you will need at the moment.  It is rarely right!  ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier!  There is one small ""tool bar"" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons.  It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.
  Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!
  Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one.  In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text.  That has been omitted in 2007.  In the ""improved"" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!
  To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions.  After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats!  If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format.  The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!
  Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems.  For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen.  Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed.  When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text.  When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top!  Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in!  (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation!  ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)
  For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.
  I have always loved Microsoft Office.  It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case.  I believe Microsoft tried to produce something ""different"" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past.

To me this is a significant feature which has led me for several years to choose Kaspersky software over it's competitors. The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars this time is that it has become less flexible, taking some decisions out of the hands of the user. While for some users this may be preferred (fewer decisions to make), I would rather have more input into how certain situations are handled. Another weak point is the anti-spam utility, which seems to miss certain types of spam and it flags some non-spam e-mails until it has built up a whitelist of OK senders. Having recently reviewed Norton's 360, it does a better job of spam control out of the box. Once trained, Kaspersky does a good job, but this takes time and work on the users part.

Norton's link scanner is a special feature. It not only tests links before you go there, but it also is capable of scanning your social media (like FaceBook) wall for links posted there, to ensure that the links lead to safe places. This is a big plus for people who are active on that social media sites. A useful feature !!

This version comes with a startup manager to help you to disable startup programs that you don't use or that you don't want to start up.

You cannot choose a disk you want to scan in a VirusScan GUI. If you want to scan just a particular volume, a folder or even a file, you can right-click on it in window explorer and choose the Scan option from the Norton sub-menu.

If there is any particular weakness in Norton360, it's the ""Backup"" feature which is very basic. And the 2GB free backup space is nearly useless. This is not a replacement for more capable backup utilities like Acronis TrueImage, or the Norton Ghost.

I edit a consumer technology website so I feel very comfortable reviewing this product. Unfortunately, I can't give Microsoft Streets and Trips more than a lukewarm recommendation.

Let's start with the installation of the the software. The installer program on the included DVD-ROM is easily confused by other startup applications ... so don't try to install this software until all of your Windows startup applications (antivirus, wireless assistants, etc.) have finished loading. Even a single background application can throw off the installation.

Once installed, the trip planning software works fine, but you can do the same thing faster, easier, and for free using Google Maps or Yahoo Maps online. The overall Streets and Trips software interface isn't very intuitive so expect to stumble around trying to figure out how it works the first few times you try to use it.

Once you're able to get the GPS receiver to lock onto satellites and provide directions, things don't get much better. The spoken turn-by-turn directions aren't always clear, and because of the weak GPS receiver (more on that later) you don't always get the verbal directions when you need them.

The included GPS receiver/USB dongle is large but doesn't provide very good reception. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio (a reasonably large US city) and half the time I cannot get the GPS receiver to lock onto a satellite. My Garmin nuvi 360 handheld GPS gets better satellite reception, is easier to use, and the spoken directions are easier to understand. The only major advantage to The Microsoft Streets and Trips software/GPS receiver combo is that you can install it on a laptop so you don't have to carry a laptop and a GPS when traveling ... you can just use your laptop. Of course, that's assuming the GPS receiver actually gets a signal and can provide turn-by-turn directions.

The software supposedly gets updates for traffic conditions, but it never seems to know when there's a major construction zone ahead ... even if it's a construction zone that has been there for several months. By comparison, my Garmin GPS almost always knows when I'm about to approach a construction zone and alerts me in advance.

Bottom line, I really can't recommend Microsoft Streets and Trips 2009 with GPS to anyone unless you can't afford a stand-alone GPS device or smartphone with built-in GPS. Yes, I suppose it's nice to be able to navigate using just your laptop in the car, but the weak GPS receiver sort of kills that benefit.","When it works it's OK, but might not be worth the money.",1247702400,4.0,

But not much else has changed since the 2013 version. However, the Premium version is still a better bargain, over the Sage 50 Complete Accounting 2014 software, with more features.

One of the biggest peves I have with Sage is their marketing ploy on how they label the stages of product.

Basic = Pro (You'd think ""Pro"" means top of the line... here you would be wrong)
Better = Complete (Doesn't ""Complete"" mean everything, the whole package?)
Best = Premium (Does not compute)
Elite = Quantum (...Describing nature at the smallest length-scales... so shouldn't this be considered ""Basic""?)

Although you are getting a descent accounting and inventory software, they are continually marketing additional add-ons and sales pitches to buy even more of their products, which should already be inclusive to the software; as reference to their title ""Complete"". It's pretty annoying after a bit.

One of the catches with this software is that it is auto-renewing. So in order to activate this software, your going to have to give them your credit card number in order to get started. Personally, I feel this is an over-the-top lock-in, so to say. They should be more like your anti-virus subscription, letting you know that your subscription is about to expire, giving YOU the option of renewing instead of them just automatically renewing.

So if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage. So you better know right off the bat if you are ready to make a true commitment to using Sage 50 Accounting software, because that is truly what it is... a commitment!

If you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget and can absolutely commit to using this software. However, if you do not need the the Payroll & Tax software, then this is indeed a good software.

I got this for my first and third graders to learn how to type.  The third grader has had a few basic lessons at school, and this program is working well with what he's doing there.  He already knew the ""home keys"", and so the lessons on learning the letters that go with the fingers were perfect for him.  He was already doing some of that, so MB is great reinforcement and extra practice for him.  He is improving steadily, and is starting to use proper form when using the computer.

The first grader on the other hand, has never had any typing lessons before.  The concept of the home keys is new to him, and it isn't really emphasized very much by MB.  He rushed through to get to the actual typing lessons, but was just using whichever fingers were easy for him to do *fast*, so I stopped him.

- The videos that show you what each lesson is about - seem to be there just so they can say they have videos, because they really are just showing the lesson.  Watch the video, do the lesson, same difference!

Well then I got a mac and went to quicken for mac and it was nice. I used Quicken 2007 for mac for several years and finally Quicken came out with what they called ""Quicken Essentials"" which was just a useless program. They stripped out most the useful features, etc. So I downgraded back to Quicken 2007 as my primary finance tool and in parallel started playing with iBank. iBank is NOT as ""pretty"" as Quicken 2007 was which is sort of sad to say. But the software does everything I need it to do. Then when Apple announced OSX Lion and Quicken announced Quicken 2007 would not work well that just sealed the deal. I left quicken 2007 and have been using iBank 4. I've used iBank for probably 3 months now off and on and the last 2 weeks daily as my primary tool. It was a slow transition  as I wanted to get used to it slowly before I upgraded to Lion.

What I like is it works. It's simple and the web connect download of transactions is super fast. Quicken used to take a long time to download my transactions, iBank is a meere matter of seconds.

iBank also has the one feature most other software is missing, the cash flow forecast. A vital tool with how I do my budgets.

iBank is NOT the most polished piece of software I've ever used. But given the limited finance software on the mac it really is the best. Plus if you use the add-on iphone app and sync your data to it, you have one more way to keep track of your money. The app is a few bucks in the app store but it is worth it.

I'm happy with this, I wish they would fix some graphic issues, make the forecast chart look better, but that's really the only complaint I have and that's minor.

After scanning some documents are organizing them through PaperPort, I confirmed that both Windows Search and Google Desktop had properly indexed the contents of the files. That is VERY useful.

I soon became completely converted to the new interface.

If you're already using any version before 2007 and find it adequate for your needs, there's still little reason to upgrade. Even more so for the 2007 version users.

Excel also has all the functions I need for stock analysis, so it's perfect.

Of course, if all you need are Word, Excel and Powerpoint, the Home and Student edition costs just 100 bucks and lets you install on up to three (3) computers, which makes it a great deal.  But if you need Access or Outlook, then a more expensive package is needed.  If you do need the software, it's worth every penny, because you can be really productive, and you can probably use the software to make money, too, unlike, say, the $600 you spend on an iPhone or iPad which is just a toy (and apps cost you money faster than you realize).

The application stopped working for me over the weekend.  Launching MyDVD put me into a never-ending loop of Windows Installer popping up.  I haven't touched the configuration of EMC-10.  Trying a repair in Control Panel | Add/Remove programs failed asking for files on a network.  I can no longer create DVDs without getting one of many obscure error codes.  The knowledgebase article at Roxio support about the installer loop said I needed to completely uninstall the product from my PC and reinstall.  The uninstall took forever because of the myriad of components EMC-10 installed without a unified uninstaller.  I am definitely NOT reinstalling this software.  I have never had an experience like this with any software package I've installed.  No way I am putting up with it.  I will be requesting an RMA today.  I am going to try Adobe instead.  At least they have a 30-day trial without having to pay up-front.  ZERO STARS!

[Original review:]
I downloaded the install for EMC-10 and was able to install the software, get it to run without crashing and produce a nice DVD from movie clips and a photo slideshow complete with background music.  This is the only part of the suite I've used so far and it worked brilliantly.  I would even say it was ""quick"" and I am using a Dell 9300 laptop with a Pentium M 1.6GHz processor and only 1GB of RAM.  I live in fear of trying the other parts of the application until I upgrade to 2GB.

The DVD burning and editing went much faster than MyDVD 5.5 and actually worked unlike MyDVD 9 (see below).  The end product is really good looking with only a few issues.  The things I don't like about the final DVD product is that the main menu music will not play for more than 60 seconds and the highlighted menu suffers from all kinds of aliasing problems with the font.  I also noticed the first few notes of any background music for a menu is lost.  The video quality is very nice taken from Motion JPEG files and 3ivx MPEG-4 files from a Canon 850is and Flip video camera, respectively.  The background music sounds great encoded as AC-3.

The nightmare was all before getting EMC-10 installed when I upgraded from MyDVD 5.5 to MyDVD 9.  Today a software package is no good without a good website, documentation and tech support.  So, while this part might not seem relevant I would beg to differ.  First, I had no clue that EMC-10 included MyDVD 10 or I certainly would not have bought MyDVD 9.  Nothing in the EMC-10 product pages indicated MyDVD was inside and version 10.  I also didn't know that MyDVD 9 would not support the files recorded from my Flip video camera.  Once again, nothing on the website saying that it does not support 3ivx MPEG-4.  Nothing on the website indicated any of this.  I figured it out reading the forums from other users.

If anything does go wrong with EMC-10 I already know I am hosed trying to use their website, documentation or support.  I am still waiting for a response from their customer support on my refund for MyDVD 9.  The instructions on their website for getting a refund don't work at all.  It can't even find my order number.

Five stars for the product features that I've used and minus two stars for the website behind the product.

[Update:] Roxio has a click-to-chat feature on their website.  I got a service rep right away and he gave me a phone number to call Digital River - the Roxio online store.  I called the number and after about 3-4 minutes on hold talked to a friendly agent who promptly sent me to a link where I clicked a couple of buttons to get my refund.

This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drews arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbors past and making friends with a local legend.
Besides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour.
 Danger on Deception Island is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.
As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you're really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company.

I also don't understand why people get this because they need Office compatibility. I opened a document from Word 2003, and in Pages it looked like the original, but in Word 2008 the margins were different and words showed up on different lines.

Those who are ripping this software as 'terrible' or 'unusable' as being overly harsh. Does it have some frustrating issues? Sure. Is it worthless and unusable? Not at all.

Word, which is the application I spent about half my work hours using, is in many cases easier to use in the 2007 version. While I'm not a huge fan of the ribbon, I don't have issues locating what I need nor do I have problems customizing it to include the features I use most often. Overall I can find exactly what I need when I need it. I think most of the complaints that I read about the ribbon have more to do with users unable to adapt than with a real design flaw inherent to the system of organization. The new DocX file format creates smaller file sizes than the old standard, but at the expense of versatility, as un-patched versions of Microsoft Word will not open them.

Excel is fantastic. The 2007 version is impressively fast compared to 2003. I can use tilt tables with 200 variables without a second delay. Also, the ability to create very high quality charts and graphs that seamlessly integrate with Power Point and Word is fantastic. I've been able to make nicer looking reports in less time than ever before. Excel is the biggest overall improvement from 2003 especially in the visual department. The addition of a wide variety of visual styles for reports is welcome and very useful.

Another great change to Excel is the detailed descriptions for each command that are available in the help section. There is still some streamlining that is missing; too much of the program is still dependent on old macro commands that no one but long time users of things like Lotus Notes have a vocabulary for.

Power Point is also a nice improvement. Adding images and then tweaking them is easier than ever. As I mentioned previously, taking charts and graphs from Excel to PP is very easy. You can use cut-and-paste, or import them directly. The resulting PP files are also smaller than the previous format, which is great for e-mailing them to people.

The much maligned DocX format was initially a real gaffe for Microsoft; not making it immediately usable by Office 2003 users was simply moronic. Although they've released several patches that do allow full implementation between 2003 and 2007 versions of Office, these updates are large (over 50mb) and while businesses most certainly have updated, it's far less likely that your friend, brother, etc., has. Sending a DocX file to those without the patch can create a bit of chaos.

Overall Office 2007 is an improvement over 2003, even if you hate the ribbon. The speed increases, added features, and integration of excel, word, and PP in a way that lets them all play together nicely is well worth the upgrade.",Better than negative reviews would have you believe,1235433600,2.0,

For the newbies out there, I was up and running with a character in about 10 minutes, with the caveat that I completed the two things in the paragraph below first!

The package contains PC and Mac DVD-ROMs. I have a blazing fast PC with 18GB of RAM, striped drives, and an Intel 990x processor.  So, installation was fairly quick and painless. I took the opportunity to read the included quick reference card while the software was loading so that I could have a basic familiarity with the software interface.  Also, I did a little picking/choosing of some tutorial videos at Lynda.com that covered an older version to have a basic understanding of what exactly Poser is and does before the software arrived.

The background work was quite beneficial and as stated I was up and running with a basic character in about 10 minutes. Poser is a program in which you create, pose, and animate 3D characters with pre-built libraries of characters, props, clothing, hair, ad-infinitum. You also have control of lighting and cameras as one would expect with anything 3D. Then you pose them as you wish or animate them to use in various other software programs to create art of all sorts.  I found the interface to be fairly intuitive and is like so many other tabbed interfaces in software I currently use. You start with a fairly featureless character in the main window then start adding features, lighting, body type, etc. One can then start to pose the character. Of course this is the 10,000 foot view as there are many controls to fine tune everything and are out of the scope of a review.

There are many sites that sell characters, props, clothing, hair, and the like to help you create just about anything having to do with a character! This is quite helpful, especially for those under time constraints or that may not be savvy enough to create their own in other content creation programs such as a 3D program or Photoshop.  I see this as no different than using stock photos/illustrations/characters in the art one creates, so it didn't bother me.

I have not animated a character yet, but that is on the agenda for the near future.  Having never used the program before I cannot speak to whether it is a worthwhile upgrade from an earlier version, but many professional reviewers think so. I think the price is reasonable. SmihMicro has three levels of this program: Poser Debut, that while being less powerful and feature packed is quite a bit less money and may serve as an entry level into the Poser family; Poser 9 which I am using/reviewing here; and Poser Pro 2012 which has all of the features of Poser 9 and many more pro-level features.

I think because I was able to be up and running so quickly, though at a basic level, that Poser 9 is a great asset to any artist or hobbyist wanting to add 3D characters to the art they create but have nothing to create said characters with. If you are a 3D neophyte that has wanted to try Poser but have been holding back on getting it because you thought it would be overwhelming or you felt you just plain didn't have time to learn it...I say go for it!",Great Software,1319673600,,

I mean, as an American, I've of course encountered words like ""grande"" and ""hombre,"" but I've had almost no Spanish instruction in my life. (I did have a semester of Spanish in sixth grade, but I am 99.9 percent sure the instructor didn't actually speak Spanish, and I certainly didn't learn anything. Plus, that was two decades ago.)

I'm still working on Level 1 of this program, because I'm the mom of a very busy toddler and I also don't want to go so fast that none of what I'm learning ""sticks."" But so far, I am absolutely in love with the Rosetta Stone program.

The software (which I run on a Macbook, with absolutely no problems) is very intuitive and easy to use. There's almost no English -- just pictures and Spanish words, phrases and sentences that you quickly come to associate with one another. For example, the software says, ""Es rojo"" and you select the picture of the red object, as opposed to the blue or green or yellow one. It's almost like being in Latin America and having a very patient Spanish-speaking friend point out everything you see, again and again and again, until you learn to associate the word and the concept or object.

This method works surprisingly well for verbs and other grammatical constructions, I've found. I was really amazed at how quickly I picked up things like subject/verb agreement just from the photos and from repetition.

There is definitely a lot of repetition. Some people may find this frustrating, especially if they pick up on something very quickly and then remember it well, but it's worked well for me. I tend to grasp a concept very fast and then forget it almost immediately. But working through this program slowly seems to really be pounding Spanish into my head.

The audio companions, while probably not strictly necessary, are nice. I listen to them while I'm driving. They're mostly of the ""listen and repeat"" variety -- at least the ones I've encountered so far are -- and it helps me to try to visualize what the speaker is talking about, as a way of refreshing what I've learned.",Absolutely awesome!,1219190400,7.0,

Any typos or mistakes in the review is a result of the program and not my typing. I used a previous dictation software in the early 2000s and was less than impressed with its ability to accurately type what I was saying. I thought it was time to give dictation software another try. The package comes with the install software, a quick start guide, and a USB microphone. The install took 2.3 GB of disk space. The system requirements are fairly hefty so make sure your computer can tow the line.  My test compute was a MacBook Pro with 8 GB of memory and a 2.4 GHz Intel core I five processor. After the installation, you will create a profile. You will then go through voice training where you will read a story and the software will get used to your voice. After voice training, you will run through very useful tutorial which has a series of lessons to help you learn the intricacies of the software.
I was very impressed on how quickly it typed what you said. In my testing and along with this review my accuracy was close to 98%. This percentage is much better than I would get if I were typing.

The Nuance website has a number of helpful videos to help you get started in your dictation. While in command mode, you can view a list of all the things that you can say. I found this very helpful.  You can also add your own commands. The program is very easy to use, however, it will take me a while to fully utilize all its capabilities. You can also go to the Nuance website and add extensions for both Safari and Firefox.

I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.

I have a long history with this product, going back to its days as Ulead's video editor. It was flaky then, stayed flaky in the occasional upgrade I've purchased and remains flaky in this most recent version.

  I needed an inexpensive video editor for another computer and I am up to my license limit on the other packages I own and my earlier VideoStudio packages are not Windows 7 compatible. This is certainly cheap enough, but true to its own traditions, it is not ready for prime time.

  For example, I tried to open two MP4 files created with the ArcSoft video product. Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 gave me a file mismatch error. However, Apple QuickTime, Avid Studio, Adobe Premiere Pro, Cyberlink PowerDirector 10, Avif Pinnacle 14 HD and Windows Movie Maker opened the MP4 files without difficulty. I noted in Corel's support forum that there are many reported problems identical or closely similar to mine. To me, that means sloppy coding and inadequate beta-testing and quality control, the same problems that have plagued Ulead/Corel problems for years. Oddly enough, Video studio Pro X4 would open other MP4 files created with the ArcSoft product.

  Next, I wanted to record from a DV source. Video Studio Pro X4 recognized the source, played the audio but would not display a preview of the video. I finally got it to work, but don't ask me how. The problem occurred on numerous occasion making VideoStudio very difficult to record with.

  I don't know what other unpleasant surprises are in store for me with Corel Video studio Pro X4, but based on past experience, there will be no shortage of them. On the other hand, the product is cheap - in more than just price - and this particular need doesn't require much more than the minimal capabilities.

  Overall, my initial impressions are negative. Should further experience change my opinion, I will amend my review. My advice though is that unless you absolutely can't afford a better video editing product, avoid Corel Video Studio Pro X4.

  I continued working with VideoStudio for another day and my impression has now solidified: it stinks.

  Repeated difficulties connecting to a known good DV device. Crashes so severely that the Windows 7 computer it was hosted on required a reboot. Usability is low with basic editing commands buried deep in the manual. Single frame key shortcuts, for example, are buried in the manual instead of in tooltips.

  My opinion: Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 is to be avoided.

At that time McAfee was the best there was.  This is no longer true.  In my opinion the best current anti virus product is ESET NOD32.

I recently tested McAfee 2012 vs Kaspersky 2011 (and Kaspersky 2012).  On testing a scan of one partition McAfee reported that it scanned 51,221 files and took one and a half hours to do it.  On the same partition Kaspersky (minor differences between the 2011 version and 2012 version) reported that it tested 779,264 files and took one hour and five minutes.

McAfee 2012 consumes 86 MB of memory (""private bytes"") and 412 MB of virtual memory.
Kaspersky 2012 uses 195 MB of memory (""private bytes"") and 596 MB of virtual memory.

Kaspersky 2011 was slightly nicer in that it reported the elapsed time to do a scan, the new version 2012 only reports when the scan finished.

Kaspersky's install is well done and impressive as it detected and removed traces of McAfee which were left behind after McAfee was uninstalled.

Kaspersky has one very valuable feature a ""rescue disk"" (a bootable disk which you can use for a clean scan of an infected system) which neither ESET nor McAfee provide.

There was about a 10 minute wait, then a transfer with another 5 minute wait. I was able to speak to a CPA who immediately understood my tax situation and questions and helped me navigate the software quickly to answer my questions. Having this priority phone support saved me hours of searching the web and actually gave me an answer from someone who knows taxes and knows TurboTax. I had never used phone support in the past as there had always been surcharges. It is so nice and comforting to talk to an actual person with tax knowledge far deeper than mine who was polite and incredibly proficient at phone support.

I've been a long-time (10+ years) user of TurboTax. Just as in years past, importing previous year's data was seamless. Please be aware that if you need Schedule D you will need Premier this year (where Deluxe may have worked in the past). I have used TurboTax to prepare and file my Federal and State taxes with multiple different tax situations (from simple W2 few investments to multiple 1099's and lots of investments).I appreciate the familiarity and simplicity of the interface and the seamlessness of year to year. Carryovers just carryover. TurboTax remembers my deductions, income, and situation from previous years and quickly walks me through them.

I am giving the software 4 out of 5 stars because sometimes it can be cumbersome to edit things after I have entered them. Particularly with small business (1099) deductions and expenses, it can be hard to make the software ""forget"" things. Also, I understand the complaints of those who are angry they have to get Premier when they used to be able to simply use Deluxe (Schedule D users). I actually had to pay $10 to upgrade my software from this to home and business to make some more significant deduction calculations related to a 1099 business. The process was seamless and $10 was not too much.

Is it to much to ask to let us draw our own line and crop from it.

I used this device to plan a family trip to Niagara Falls, which I figured would be a good test as we had never been there before and we wanted to know about as many family-friendly things as possible and find a quick and safe route to and from there. We also have a Magellan 3000 and have used it for trips to places we have never been to. I have also had a good bit of experience working with in-vehicle mobile data systems.

Now the de-bunking:
Depending on which product description you read, you might come across the statement: ""NEW-compact, cable-free GPS Locator."" Which might lead you to believe that said device connects wirelessly to your PC, which it does NOT. It has a USB GPS receiver that is not wireless. You may have difficulty placing your laptop in a safe location that is also able to receive the GPS satellite broadcasts, so you might need to use a cable to place it where it will pick up the satellite broadcasts.  The length of the included cable is very short, I would suggest you get a three foot USB extension cable (male to female -- NOT the kind you would use for a printer) and use that instead. In addition to that, you will want to put it some where that the screen will be visible / out of direct sunlight, usually, if you intend to glance at it during en-route navigation. You might also need a screen shade if sunlight is a problem. Another thing that might be distracting is the flashing `Microsoft' on the receiver.
 [Also, when I say safe, you need to be able to attach you laptop to something that will hold it securely in case you have a crash and the airbags deploy and to prevent the laptop from slamming into your body.]

If you want to use it in your vehicle for extended periods, you will ALSO need a power supply for your laptop, which would be a DC to AC inverter for your regular power supply / battery charger or a DC to DC adapter so you can do without your power brick. Having the inverter may be a more versatile, but have the other one might be a little more efficient.

There is value in having a bigger screen, as long as it is not distracting while you are trying to drive.
The GPS receiver worked well, and fast, even inside my house, which has a very wide overhanging roof.
 It seems to be able to search for and update construction information (which most cheaper, stand-alone units cannot) as long as you do that while online.

I think the real value of it is the planning side of things. It does not seem to have more data than the Magellan GPS we have, but it would be easier to update the software and data than with a stand-alone unit. I would like to be able to search for places we like along the way by name (like Cracker Barrel, for instance).

It seems to me like it would be useful if you are making sales calls and need to update where you are going once or twice a day.
It nags you that you are off route frequently if you are going slowly and changing lanes on a multi-lane roadway, so that can become annoying.
It is helpful to be able to print out the maps so you can become familiar with the route. Be sure to have your computer online BEFORE you install it, just in case you need a component that you do not already have installed.

It is generally not hard to install, though some systems may have programs installed that interfere, so it's best to close out everything else that is running before starting the installation. If you have X5 and are satisfied then there's not much reason to upgrade - Winzip, the program that began as popular shareware, is an addition to X6 that most people won't really need. WordPerfect Office is compatible with MS Office/Word formats so you can exchange files between the two, and there is similar functionality. Each suite has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the user. WordPerfect is more affordable since it doesn't have the market dominance that MS Office has. For those really on a tight budget there is the OpenOffice program that can be obtained for free online from Sun MicroSystems. That one handles the basics well but lacks a lot of extra features and options that you can get in the commercial Office suites.

Six years ago, I switched to a Mac and didn't go back to Norton. I used nothing for a while since Macs are less likely to be hacked, but that made me very nervous. I installed the free version of Avast and used it until a Mac-savvy friend who was trying to speed my old Mac back up told me I really needed Norton for Mac. (Indeed there was a disk-filling virus in that machine that only Norton was able to catch - Avast was unaware of it.) He told me to run full scans regularly - not just the quickies - and I did that, too.)

It supported most any video type I threw at it from multiple camcorders, phones, etc.  The one place it failed were on some AVIs of 8mm films that were encoded with the Cineform codec.  I used my 14-day 1-use support request only to get a semi-english response that said ""sorry it doesn't work with Cineform"".  Beware that support is iffy with this product.  You only get 14 days from the point of install, and only 1 issue.  After that you have to pay.  I wouldn't pay for the support I received.

Realtime preview is ok, but it wants to render things a bit more than I expected.  Particularly with speeding up video, it has to render the scene completely before it'll show any sort of preview.  Rendering 1080 video from my camcorder took a long time, as does exporting to other formats.

One other annoying thing is that it automatically starts searching and importing media files whenever you start up.  Also, the export presets are plentiful, but you can't modify them.  Instead you have to select a custom format, then set it up to do what you want.  There's also no function to specify a specific output type, then specify a maximum size.  For Amazon reviews, you have a 100MB limit.  I couldn't just set output to 99MB and let it choose the bitrate, nor could I easily exclude audio or set it to mono without making a complete custom setting.  Further, when customizing an output format, it wouldn't update the estimated size, so in the end I just had to make changes and export, then hope it fell under the size I was looking for.

As for actual editing, I thought it did pretty well.  Every program has its own learning curve and this one is no different.  As with most programs it has more transitions and effects than I'll ever use.  I also like that this version comes with the live screen capture built in, as that is something I've used other programs for in the past.

Here's my review. .  . .. .

I have been using this product, off and on, for a little over a month now.  Here's my take on it. . . . If you are either a slow typist, or have a disability which does not allow you to type, then I think that this software is probably going to be helpful for you.  The box says that most people type no more than 40 words per minute.  I type over twice that.  I use this software when I want to send a letter to a friend.  I would not use this for business purposes.  You spend a lot of time correcting and ""training"" the system.  I find far fewer mistakes when I'm typing it myself than when I'm using this software.  But again, I type relatively fast.  Having spent a LOT of extra money to purchase the ""Preferred"" edition, I really wish I had stuck with the ""Standard"" edition.  Using it for Excel (not available on the Standard edition)  is cumbersome at best, and being that often times numbers are so important in spreadsheets, it's quite ""error prone"" and correcting a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet is not fun.  Again, I'm not really knocking the software.  I think it does a relatively good job overall, and I'm sure that if you take the time to make all of the corrections it gets better. .  .. but. . . I think if you type fast to begin with, you're probably not going to be too happy with this software.  Unless the above ""extras"" included in the Preferred edition are really worth a lot to you, I would recommend the Standard edition and save yourself some $$.

On one DVD, you are getting essentially a textbook with a few extras that will be good for years to come. I think this is a good reference for several different types of mathematics that students will encounter from middle school through college, but in all honesty, I purchased it with my daughter in mind. She's currently taking Pre-Algebra in 6th grade and I wanted to give her a leg-up by offering a supplement at home that was not her textbook.

After playing with the software myself these are my impressions.

INTERFACE: How it Looks

This program is not overly appealing visually, but it's not terrible either. If you have the sound on, the voices (several are used depending upon where you are in the program) are a bit boring. Can anyone really fix that one though?  In parts of the program the makers use a space-age theme; in the Algebra Booster for example, there is a math game designed to help kids think algebraically while doing a Pac-Man type game. I played it and found it to be 'OK'.  My 11 year old wasn't overly impressed, but I think she was expecting it to play like her other video games. Bottom line: It really looks like something from 1999 versus 2009.

CONTENT:  What's on the DVD?

For each of the math subjects: Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I... through Calculus and Statistics, there are tabs at the top of the screen.

 ""Lessons"" has subcatagories of 'Basics' and 'Chapters'.  This is basically like a textbook or reference book that you can read when you need it.  Another tab, ""Challenge"" is a problem that in the end asks you questions, but I didn't find an answer to the question... just more questions.  I guess it's designed to help students think a bit deeper.  The third tab is ""Exercises"", which as you would imagine has questions relating to whatever subject inside a math type you are studying.  If you get the wrong answer, it tells you you're wrong, but since they are multiple choice, you never get an explanation, you just get to choose again.  You can view your score and get a report on which ones you got right and wrong to review.  ""Real Life"" is a story problem.  Using the current skill set to solve an every-day issue.  ""Animation"" is a short video illustrating the current skill. It's the company's attempt to 'cartoon up' the software. For visual learners this will be helpful, but the few I viewed were kind of stupid.

The DVD also has bonus applications:  Runes of Avalon and Calculus Ipod material.  I couldn't get the link for the ipod material to open on my computer despite having iTunes and an Ipod Touch, but the game, Runes of Avalon, did install and I played it. It's more a spacial recognition game versus a math game, but it looks good (better than the rest of the software) and the gameplay was smooth.

A strange addition to the package was a CD with animal screensavers on it. The animals look like they are licking your monitor clean. Cute, but seemed like it fell into the wrong box!

CONCLUSION: Would I buy it again? Was it what I was looking for in math-help software?

I got a heck of a deal on this one - under 10 dollars when the local warehouse store was still selling it for over thirty. If I'd paid more, I probably would be a bit irked, but for the money paid... I'm happy. I would buy it again and recommend it as a 'reference' source.

As for whether it was what I was looking for... yes and no. I expected explanations of the subjects listed. I got that and examples, just like a textbook would offer. What I didn't get was the ability to print off worksheets and answer sheets for practice. That would have been great! I found a few places online with free worksheets and some paid sites, but I had hopes that this would offer this and it didn't. Some more games would have been great too, as would the ability of the software to give feedback on a step-by-step basis, versus simply 'wrong' and then you figure it out.

This is a good math resource for any math students seeking a supplement to their current textbook, but it is not software that's filled with useful games and printable worksheets.

I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

2445,4705,4705,1.0,False,"06 24, 2010",A38NELQT98S4H8,B003HCA7GA,,WB Halper,"Final Update - On February 1, 2011, I went to the Autodesk website to check for additional updates and found that FreeStyle had been withdrawn from sale.  Customer support stopped April 1, 2011.

Update 10/7/2010 - The first product update was released a couple of weeks ago. The major change fixes the first item below...you can now create custom symbols and store them in the library.  I'm still in the process of evaluating the release and will update this note after I've used it a bit more.

Original Review:
The designers of a package like AutoCAD FreeStyle face a classic challenge: It needs to be easy to use for a novice, with enough features to be useful, yet not so powerful that it will cannibalize sales of the high-end (and much more expensive) AutoCAD systems.  After spending a couple of days using AutoCAD FreeStyle, I think the designers set the bar way too low.  The interface is simple and easy to learn, but far too many features are missing for FreeStyle to be a competitive program.  That's not to say that FreeStyle can't be used to produce usable drawings; it just could be much better if it included basic features that are in other systems.  Let me go through some of the areas that stood out...

Symbol Library - A library is a collection of symbols that are created once and then used on multiple drawings.  FreeStyle comes with a collection of prebuilt symbols that are sufficient to get started, however it's not a complete enough library for a lot of projects - when I attempted to draw my sprinkler system, I discovered that there are no sprinkler components listed.  In most CAD systems, this problem is addressed by allowing the user to build custom symbols.  Once they're added to the library, they can be repeatedly used in future drawings.  This release of FreeStyle doesn't have that capability.  The symbols that come with the program are all that you've got, and that simply isn't enough.  Incidentally, what's in the library is even a little strange... the Electrical Symbols tab includes five Gas and Water symbols along with the basic electrical symbols and the Building Components section only contains six fireplace facades...I'm sure that in real life there are more building components than just those.

Paper Size and Scale - When you start a new drawing, the program asks you to select the size of the paper and the object that you' re going to draw.  e.g. you pick 8.5 x 11"" paper and select that the page represents a 30' x 40' space.  The scale shows that "" equals 1'.  This makes perfect sense to anybody not used to using a CAD program, but is backwards from the norm...normally a designer would select a paper size and a scale.

Splines - Splines are a way of smoothly connecting a series of points.  By adjusting the ""handles"", you can easily draw complex curves.  FreeStyle doesn't have a way of drawing with splines.  The menu allows you to draw with arc segments, straight lines and freehand ""doodles"".  You can adjust the points of inflection on the doodle and eventually get to the desired curve, but it's not as easy as it seems.  True spline capability would be easier.

Radius line joins - When drawing a floor plan, most lines meet with a sharp corner, but that's not always the case.  Sometimes a drawing needs to have a rounded curve joining the two lines.  Most 2-D drafting systems can do that automatically, but FreeStyle lacks that capability.  You can manually accomplish the same thing by drawing a small arc, but why?  You're only talking about a millisecond of computer time to have the program do it for you.

Double lines for walls - Often walls in architectural drawings are shown by two parallel lines, representing the inside and outside surfaces.  Freestyle doesn't have that ability built-in.  To do it correctly, it's a little more complicated that just having a double line as a selectable line type....you need to specify wall thickness, join corners correctly and scale appropriately as the drawing size changes.  Again, all this can be done manually, but the basic idea is to have the program save time by doing the work for you.  Incidentally, the work around is to simply draw a thick solid line for walls...look at all the sample drawings for examples.

Draw a wall of a house.  Now drag a window or door from the symbol library and place it onto the wall.  You'd think that the wall would break and allow the object to be inserted.  It doesn't.  OK, now manually break the wall into two separate line segments and drag the line ends apart to create the necessary break.  That would work, if there was a way to break a line into two pieces, but there isn't.  So you nuke the whole side of the house and redraw two separate line segments on either side of the door.  That works...until you realize that the door is 6"" to the left of where it should be.

The algorithm that calculates color fills is flaky.  When you drag the fill icon over a fillable area, the area is highlighted with a light version of the fill color. It's a nice idea, so you can see exactly where the color's going.  Unfortunately, a single open pixel prevents an area from filling.  The highlighting, though, isn't nearly so discerning.  It's not unusual to have an area highlight, but fail to fill when clicking on the mouse button.  I also managed to fill in an object and then select the color and move it while leaving the outline behind...it was a little strange.

There's no instruction manual.  You can get help for any of the commands by selecting that command and clicking the question mark icon.  Clicking on the icon showing three stacked baby letter blocks takes you to the Freestyle website where there is more detailed information.  It's annoying, though, not to have something you can skim through.  I was trying to figure out how to color in a tree and it wasn't until I saw a picture in the on-line help that I realized that the color was coming from a filled in circle located behind the tree.

I could add more, but you get the idea.  If the product manager at AutoDesk chooses, all of these can (and should) be fixed in a future release.  Until then, though, I'm only giving FreeStyle two stars.  The simple user interface is right on the mark for a non-technical consumer level product.  The omitted features, though, cost it dearly in the ability to produce usable and functional drawings.",Not quite ready for prime time...and now it never will be,1277337600,47.0,

Time Machine has been a fantastic feature to have, painlessly backing up data for me in the background and saving me the trouble of doing so manually.  Typically it does so with no additional drag on the responsiveness of the computer (which is several years old, and I tend to run a lot of programs at a time) though occasionally if I've left it unhooked from the external drive for an extended period and it has a lot to sort through the responsiveness will slow for a minute or two while it catches up.

Spaces is a great feature as well, allowing you to divide your windows up among multiple 'virtual' desktops.  On this particular computer I find that I don't use it a great deal, because I don't find that a laptop lends itself to this style of use for me.  However, I've used similar features from Linux distributions on a desktop to know that in that situation it's a great help to keeping things organized and moving along.

The best thing I can say about Quicken 2012 is that it is not much worse than Quicken 2011.  In fact, there is little apparent difference at all in terms of functionality, other than two annoyances:

1. If you leave Quicken running overnight, as soon as you focus on the Quicken window the next day, it announces that it needs to restart itself and immediately does so (whether you like it or not).  It has apparently lost its ability to refresh various dates while the application is running.

2. It is even slower than 2011.

All in all, you get no noticable new features and two annoyances, so I don't know why anyone using Quicken 2011 should bother upgrading.

AutoCAD LT 2010 finally fills this requirement, and does it very well. I was able to open and edit AutoCAD 2010 files with no issues at all. Whether I was reviewing someone else's drawings, or creating drawings of my own from scratch, this package delivers nicely.

Previous versions of LT have choked on some advanced AutoCAD features, and invariably the drawings I have to review include those features. Other times, I really need an AutoCAD feature that just isn't included in the LT version. LT 2010 includes everything I can think of, including things like opening and editing in-place of external reference .dwg files, support for publishing to plotters, object alignment, and a lot of the block reference features.

It has almost everything...except it doesn't have any of AutoCAD 2010 3D modelling and rending capabilities, and it won't even print AutoCAD 3D images. This last one rankles a bit, because I inevitably have to call the client back and ask them to convert to a format I can handle, or print it themselves.

So I have to compare how much of an improvement there has been compared to the years before that. New versions (actually new releases, using the industry parlance that was in place when Quicken for DOS first hit the market) are iterative, add some new features, but are largely the same as older versions with only one or two significantly new or improved features. If you put this in a historical context, that's actually a good thing. When Scott Cook first came up with Quicken, he didn't take the traditional approach. He advertised in airline magazines rather than computer magazines and advertised to ""regular people"" rather than computer people. Instead of selling for the inflation-adjusted price of $854, which was common for spreadsheets, databases and word processors of the day, he sold the software for well under $100, inflation adjusted. And he sold annual updates for a price low enough that it was literally cheaper than buying an aftermarket book on how to use the product. They weren't major changes, but they were affordable. So when you pay a mere $39.99 for the entire product, depending on the version, you are benefiting from a revolution that Scott Cook single-handedly put in place to change the entire software industry.

In that sense, you get a lot for your money. When I first started using Quicken, it was an easy way to keep my checkbook balanced, and allowed me to print checks directly from a dot matrix printer. Over time, support was added for credit cards, investments, real property, and even business functions depending on the version. The software lets you look at the big picture when it comes to your finances. It lets you link accounts in such a way that you can see what comes out of one account when it goes into another account, or what goes from your cash account to your investment account or from your checking account to pay your credit card bills. It lets you keep track of your receipts and keep images of your checks or invoices with the individual transactions. And it keeps track of your securities, monitors the prices, and shows you how well your investments perform. It does so a lot better than tools you might find at your brokerage since there are so many ways of reporting things.

The latest version has cloud support and support for an app for your phone. Yes, it's limited to spending accounts and you will still have to use an app from your broker to get an instant view of your investments. Then again, you would need to do so to execute trades anyway. But for spending, it's a lot easier to snap a photo of a receipt with a smartphone than to scan it or enter it later, so when it syncs with the desktop app, it's easier to match things up with downloaded transactions.

It's come a long way from its origins, and although I no longer need it for printing out the checks to pay my monthly bills, I can use it to track more complex financial concerns such as stocks, bonds, options trading, ESPP shares, employee stock options, the value of my home, my mortgage payments with an ongoing view of principal and interest, and even paychecks with the amount split to account for federal, state, and local taxes, FICA, medicare and deductions for 401(k)s (which end up in the appropriate account register automatically) or healthcare spending or ESPPs. It lets you keep track of spending by categories, and allows for tags (formerly classes) so you can track things in multiple directions. If you want to get a report on spending by category or figure out how much you spent on education or dining, it's easy. And if you tag things so that you know which expenses were for your 2006 Hawaii trip, you can know how much you spent in total or break it down by airfare, lodging, meals or souvenirs. You can even use foreign currency and account for exchange rates.  You can use as little or as many of these features as you want. You can establish budgets and see how well you've been doing for years or decades, depending on how long you've been using the product.

The product isn't perfect and still has a few bugs in it that affect usability but not the underlying financial integrity of your data. And some tasks are easier than others. Some of the wizards work from some places and not others. And some areas are not optimized for the type of security. For example, options trading is a thinly disguised version of stock trading, won't let you use standard actions such as ""sell to open"", ""buy to close"" or expire contracts based on the date in the symbol and the price of the underlying security. You might need to use less obvious terms such as buying to cover at zero cost in order to close out expired contracts. And you need to view things as shares instead of contracts. Plus there's no price history for options. And there's no support for RSUs, despite the fact that the people in charge of Quicken have been granted RSUs, and thus can't use the product to track their own finances in a comprehensive way.

Despite the limitations, the product still covers the most common needs of most users. I'd like to see more emphasis on adding support for new features such as the ones I've mentioned, especially given that they aren't major programming tasks. I think the product has gotten so comprehensive that they are running out of ideas as to what to add for new releases.

The product also comes with three years of data service at no extra charge, after which you will most likely want to get a newer version. I think they would have had fewer detractors had they marketed the data service as a separate entity and let you know they are bundling it for free. The product itself does not expire, as many people think, but becomes a lot less useful once the data service expires and you can no longer download from your financial institutions. It's simply too expensive for the company to offer that kind of support for a longer period than what they cover, and it's cheap enough that even if you don't upgrade annually, it's worth getting a new version at least every two years.

It will completely restore your operating system, programs & files to the time and date that you last saved an image of your drive with Acronis. If you have a software failure, Acronis can have your system up in running in minutes. If you have a hard drive failure, you need to find another similar hard drive and then in minutes you can again have a working system. Acronis 11 performs other tasks but this review only addresses one critical issue: full system image backups.

The downside of the program is that the menus are not intuitive and can be confusing and at first, a bit frustrating. You absolutely must create & test the Acronis recovery disk to be sure it works and that this recovery disk and your computer will read the hard drive on which you have saved a disk image. You absolutely must validate each disk image you create and then mount it to test that the saved image files are readable. And you must save complete or updated hard drive images frequently, I do it monthly, so you have the data you need is saved in case you need it.

If your system fails and your saved image is 6 months old, you have lost 6 months of data unless you have saved it on some other restorable media.

If you do the musts listed above, you can breath easy and be confident that all will be well with your software treasure if you system fails.

After months of ambivalence (and waiting for the supposed automatic offer), I decided to upgrade from version 1.0 to 2.0 on three computers: One desktop with 4 GB of memory with Vista Ultimate, a laptop with Vista home premium and 2GB memory, and an 8 yearold but highly reliable CPU with only 256MB memory. Version 1.0 ran adequately on the first two units and from all appearances this version 2.0 is not as resource intensive as the earlier version however, LiveUpdate remains an annoyance.

Similarly to version 1.0, it appears the only other Norton product that is compatible with 360 is Norton Ghost.

In the case of the older unit, performance of Norton 360  was consistently problematic so I was not surprised to encounter difficulties with the upgrade however I had no inkling of the extent of encumbrances I would face in what from a cursory view appeared to be a rather benign installation.

Like security suites offered by other vendors version 2.0 includes virus protection (unfortunately still updated via LiveUpdate whereas NIS 2009 is migrating to real time updating) firewall, spyware and intrusion protection, email scanning, parental controls and anti-spam filtering. The latter mentioned features are available as add-on packs accessible from Symantec's website. This version also enhances network monitoring capabilities and expands supported media for backups. Curiously, and incongruently, while network attached storage devices like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Netgear-RND2150-ReadyNAS-Duo-500-GB-Desktop-Network-Attached-Storage/dp/B0013G04AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Netgear RND2150 ReadyNAS Duo 500 GB Desktop Network Attached Storage</a>&nbsp;are discovered by network monitoring, automatic backup to the same device is not supported. It should also be noted the only qualitative difference I can see between the standard version and the premier version of 2.0 is the increased online secure backup storage of  10GB in the case of the premier edition. Standard edition availability is 2GB and in my opinion neither is sufficient. As an all in one product, some compromises in user control could be anticipated however it would have been an advantage if the user was offered the capability to backup individual files rather than continuing the limitation to classes of folders. Essentially, while backup to ipods is intriguing, I see little advantage to employing this backup facility over the functionality existent in both XP and Vista operating systems.

The network monitoring feature is beneficial but is flawed to the extent multiple devices connected to a single access point  like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NETGEAR-HD-Gaming-5-GHz-Wireless-N-Networking-Kit-WNHDEB111/dp/B00126R3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111)</a>&nbsp;are not individually distinguishable. Only the mac address of the access point is identified therefore from my primary computer I cannot fully monitor a second PC or my NAS.

This version also includes registry cleaning as a component of the PC tune-up facility and ""identity safe security"" of personal information like social security, bank account and credit card numbers. The phishing filter is an improvement over version 1.0 however it still lacks the comprehensiveness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Site-Advisor-Plus-2009-1-User/dp/B001EJQTUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Site Advisor Plus 2009 1-User</a>&nbsp;in as much as it does not offer advice search engine results. Significantly, the phishing filter does not work with Safari or Google chrome.

And then there was the upgrade on my older PC...

In spite of Norton's representations, I would not recommend installation on any PC that meets only minimum system requirements. At every step, I encountered difficulties that severely constrained the process and after 24 man hours devoted to installation the process is still incomplete.

First and foremost, upgrade is not automatic. Although 360 offers three PC licensing, I could not download the upgrade via my existing account. Only after email inquiry was I provided  an address that facilitated download to my second and third PCs. In the instance of my oldest unit I made the mistake of running the recommended system scan before installation. It occurred to me as well, this does not generate a great deal of confidence in Norton if in fact one is upgrading or replacing an existing Norton anti-virus program. I received a message indicating this version was incompatible with Windows Defender so I had to remove that program before proceeding. I did not pre-scan with the other two PCs and no compatibility issues were identified nor I have experienced any since the upgrade or have I ever encountered issues in the two years I used 360 version 1.0.

Although during install procedure on my first computer I was advised existing add-on packs should be backed up using another program that must be downloaded from the Norton site, the same message was not received for either of the later installs and the add-on pack itself appeared on my desktop upon completion of the preliminary stages, but I get ahead of myself. The install aborted three times because LiveUpdate was running in the background and could not be terminated even manually via msconfig or the task manager. When I finally managed to disable it, I later discovered another version initiated by Norton Ghost could not be removed, so I had to uninstall Ghost before proceeding. Degradation of system performance was clearly evident as at least five hard stops were required and in each case the difference in boot times was visually perceptible without Norton running. Eventually, the install was completed but start up would not progress past the call to explorer.exe which was visible but the desktop icons were never painted...another hard stop via task manager and restart.

Finally, the configuration wizard appeared and I was able to setup the program...only to discover Norton had identified un-removable cookies,an un-repairable virus and my virus definitions from version 1.0 had not updated via LiveUpdate for more than 8 months. Following program instructions to contact online support for more information, I reached site catch 22 as the more information could not be gleaned until I defined the problem inhibiting installation...After removing the cookies with spybot and determining the virus was most likely Norton Ghost LiveUpdate, and  running a new version of LiveUpdate for more than two hours to acquire all of the missed updates, I received an email from support advising I should download a software removal tool to wipe out any residue programs, which of course would also wipe out my latest install and render 14 hours of effort pointless.

So now, I have version 2.0 installed and running with significantly greater degradation than version 1.0 as it applies to response time for Explorer or Firefox so I'm using Safari as the default browser and it performs with blazing speed even on this under resourced box with Norton installed.

I had never bothered to try AVG Internet Security (AVG IS), mainly because it is an expensive package in comparison to most of the other offerings on the market. That said, it is a solid product and worth consideration in spite of the cost.

I should start by stating, for the record, that I had a dreadful install experience. AVG IS partially installed itself and then errored out. After a reboot, AVG IS was alive but outdated, and what was broken was the ability to update. Worse, the uninstall was also broken. After getting the uninstall ironed out, I tried to install again and this time everything was much smoother.

AVG IS is organized and clean with a very clear and easy-to-understand overview dashboard. At a glance you can tell what is active and what is not active. Double-clicking on any of the icons in this view gives access to adjustment controls by which the component in question can be manipulated and set as desired. I like this particular view. One thing that is not clear, though, is that to get to the real nuts and bolts of the various components' configurations, one must use the pull-down menus, not the icons.

AVG's firewall appears to do a good job of hiding the system on the net, locking down service ports and cutting off ping responses. I was unable to break it. However, where it gets interesting is in the control afforded the user - individual applications can be locked down, policies set for different networks, and so much more. Other firewalls do this, but AVG's organization in the interface is better than average.

AVG's track record as an antivirus vendor is well known. However, with versions prior to 9.0 their antivirus was slow, intrusive and hard to interrupt. AVG seems to have gotten the idea of how to improve this - it took about 90 minutes to scan over 1,000,000 items if you include the registry and even running at full speed I hardly noticed except for the fact that I had the task manager open and saw an occasional spike in CPU activity. I launched several applications, typed a lot, and even searched for a file on the hard drive and saw no real impact on the system. Cycles consumed seemed to be consistently under 10%.

AVG throws a lot of other things into the mix that you'd expect in a decent suite - antispam, antispyware, rootkit detection, and several other components. What surprised me was to find a process viewer that has the ability to kill processes, accessible from the dashboard under system tools. I have never worked with a security suite with that built-in as part of the package. Included is a connectivity viewer and even a startup process viewer, with the ability to manipulate the entries within. That's a very nice plus.

I've been unable to work with the antispam up to this point, as I get no spam. Even so, there are many, many settings that can be adjusted to the antispam, such as adding a blacklist server such as spamcop to assist with checking, Bayesian training and a lot more. Based on the feature set I suspect this antispam is very effective.

AVG IS includes a McAfee-style system of evaluating returns from search engines, marking unsafe links in the results window. It is not as thorough as McAfee's Site Adviser, but it is effective in giving you  heads-up when there is a possible danger ahead.

There are two things that AVG does not have that I wish were present. First, there is no parental control module. It looks like AVG made no effort at all to include a parental controls module, and while that's ok it is something that most other security suites include.  I was unable to even find a manual block list - if it's there, I cannot find it. Second, I found no ability to see the presence of other computers on the network. It is not something that I have found in a lot of suites but it's a very nice-to-have.

AVG has put together a very nice internet security suite. The main components, the antivirus and the firewall, are both very effective and all of the other components seem to be working nicely. There is room for some improvement/expansion, as is true with most security suites, but what is here is very polished and clean. AVG is a little pricey when compared to most other suites, but in spite of that cost it is very much worth consideration when looking at computer security suites. I am comfortable giving AVG IS a 5/5 stars rating - it isn't absolutely perfect, but what is there is excellent.",Solid Product,1259798400,7.0,

You also get fonts, dictionary, digital photos, templates, graphics, basic graphics editor, batch conversion from Word files, and training videos.

IS IT WORTH IT?
Yes, this program works well for the price, although honestly, if you can afford the upgrade price of the Standard version or others, I would go for that instead.  I really wanted the Ebook Editor, PDF creator, and some of the other cool features of the Standard version which is what I thought I had requested.

The program works well and seems to be a tiny bit faster than the previous X6 version.  I am using this with Windows 7 64-bit.

This is great for general home use and student use who need basics which are a cut above super basic.  It is a solid program so far, and despite my disappointment in the version I received, I still think it is decent for what you get.

I will edit this review as I continue to use the program if there are any other important points that I want to make if I find differences in the program from version X6.  As it stands now from the time I have used it and played with it, it is quite similar to the previous version of this edition of Office, which I did use with very few problems.  I got files to convert pretty easily from Word, and was able to save them in the proper file form as well, that others could read with Word.

I travel a lot for speaking (driving myself), and my GPS maps are out of date. This promised the possibility of being able to add files to the GPS, plus some other features that looked promising. However, as I've played around with it, I'm a little disappointed with the results. I'll start with the positives though. I should note, this is a new install, not an upgrade from a previous version.

What I liked: I installed this on my Windows 7 computer without hitches.  This software communicates with the internet to give up to date reports of construction. This is something that most online free programs and normal GPS don't do. It's easy to customize a route, add stops, drag the route to a different road and set up a whole itinerary. The database recognized most locations by description and filled in the address, which was helpful. I liked the ability to calculate gas cost based on the MPG of my vehicle and the average cost of gas. A big benefit is the ability to plan a trip and come back to the file to make changes as the planning continues. Using a free online program doesn't carry this benefit. Also, it works on a laptop when you don't have Wifi, since it's installed on the computer. Big bonus if you're in the car trying to modify your route and you have your computer along.

What I didn't like: While the product does not promise to work with all GPS, it didn't work with my Garmin. I have the ability to add GPX files, but they wouldn't open on the machine. The program did not recognize my Garmin when it was plugged in, and the manually transferred files didn't work. Also, the software has a button to click to transfer the map to a cell phone. This didn't work for me either, since I'd have to have Microsoft Outlook for this to work. Seems that if I'm running and Microsoft computer with the latest Windows and Windows Live Mail, this ought to work. But it's set up to work only with the cadillac of e-mail programs. When I tried printing, sometimes just the map would print. There wasn't an option that I could find to fix this. When I hit print, it just went to the printer with no in between step where I could choose settings. Some landmarks that I would expect to be in the maps aren't. For example, I searched for a county park near me and the name of the park, nor the lake showed anything.

All in all, I don't think I'd purchase this in the future. Although it has some good features, I can get most of what I got from it on Google maps or Mapquest for free. If the uploading to my GPS and the sending to my cell phone would work, I'd reconsider my opinion of the program.

With Ulead VideoStudio I am stumped.

The first 3 times I tried to install it the installation simply froze in the middle and I had to shut down my system to get it to work again. The 4th time I was able to load the software and then it asked me to insert the bonus CD which comes with WinDVD - the CD authoring software - and extra audio, video clips. The moment WinDVD started to install on my system it tried to delete some files which caused a fatal system error and I got blue screened. I began again the next day, I installed the software again and did not put in the bonus CD as suggested.

The software is easy to work with, it can convert your DV tapes to digital media or you can edit your digital media. It's easy to drop in your video clips, drag in audio and use transitions. You may not able to use your computer for much else while editing unless you have a very powerful system. However, once you're done editing, it can be very frustrating to go through the authoring process.

I upgraded to 2012 last month, and have been using it daily to evaluate it against the previous year's release.  Since I am familiar with the Quickbooks software, I tried out some of the new features first.  I have several different accounts in my file, and 2012 includes the option to assign different accounts different functions.  I have found this extremely useful for integrating aspects of my personal account with my business account, and I think it will make things easier at tax time as well.  If you have multiple accounts, I think you will definitely enjoy this feature. Unfortunately, that is the only new feature I really could see a use for.  I found the others appeared to be thrown in for the sole purpose of being able to release a new version.  It seems like all companies are doing that now, and just trying to add in more and more bloat to force users to upgrade. I can pretty much guarantee you there will be a Quickbooks 2013, 2014, 2015, etc.  Why not just wait until you have something substantial to add before developing an upgrade?  Intuit briefly got away from this several years ago and now it seems like they're back.

The main problem I had with Quickbooks For Mac 2012 is the difference between it and the 2011 version that I previously used for Windows.  I expected the 2012 Mac version to be a mirror image of the Windows version, however there are noticeable differences and features missing. The most important to me, is that my financial institution for my personal accounts does not support it. While this would seemingly be a problem on behalf of the financial institution, when I compared the lists of support for the two systems, I noticed it is fairly significant.  Why not have an option for converting the file formats like my genealogy software has?  If there is such a thing, I could not find it anywhere.  The second thing I noticed is that several of the reports I frequently used in 2011 for Windows are completely missing in the Mac version.  I realize that there are many more X86 systems than Mac, but the lack of some of these features make Quickbooks for Mac 2012 seem more like an afterthought than a quality piece of software.

While I do feel that 2012 is a worthy buy if you are using Quickbooks 2010 and prior, I don't feel it is significant enough to warrant an upgrade, and I definitely won't be replacing my Windows version with the Mac release.","2012 is decent software, IF you have the Windows version and IF you aren't upgrading from 2011",1324425600,6.0,

Another issue is the almost non-existent backwards compatibility with previous versions, meaning that only the simplest layouts are likely to successfully transfer across versions.

To get around these problems, I switch all the auto-format features off, and ship anything that needs to be accurately conveyed as a .PDF (Adobe Acrobat), which Word is highly integrated with. Macros work okay, but are best written up in the macro editor. Text for use outside of Word is best saved as a plain Text file, and any formatting done within the destination application. Framemaker, for example.

Word is a good word processor and is not a DTP application to any useful extent. And used in its word processor mode, it does compare more than favourably with any alternative that I have tried.

Got all the way down to filing the return (tonite!) ...and even up to: ""How do You Want Your Federal Refund"" but WAS Very dismayed to Not see the option for the Amazon Gift Card purchase!  :-(

What I learned from intuit help forum:

Problem Scenario (just like mine): ""I am currently on the File -> How would you like to get your federal refund? page and I do not see an option to receive part of the refund on Amazon Gift Cards. The only options that I see are Direct Deposit, Paper Check and Split into Multiple Accounts.""

Resolution: ""it is past that section. Enter that you want the refund to be deposited to your account, and enter bank info. The page will come up after that.""

I did that, and sure enough, it worked! I see option: ""I'll use all or some of my refund to purchase an e-gift card and get an extra 10%"" And the Amazon logo is there, etc.

Cool!  :-)

Hope this helps somebody else to bypass a bad moment I had there.

Also note that, to get the Amazon Gift Card, you have to e-file and Not split your refund over multiple accounts (just one bank account). Some other restrictions are there, but don't apply to an average guy like me.

For about 10 years now, I have enjoyed the perfection of the Turbo Tax software.  Only one year did I have an install issue, and that was quickly resolved by Customer Support.  And as a bonus - the tip I got from the support rep has been used to resolve other software installs and shared with others over the years.  (Thanks *again* to ""Rey"" from Turbo Tax customer support!)

Love the way I can import last year's tax data and don't re-type squat!  This is HUGE to me!  W-2s are tedious!

-> Please note, I always go with the CD/ROM version exclusively.  (I note that the download version reviews aren't so hot this year)

You just can't beat the completeness, rapidity and perfection of the Turbo Tax experience as delivered on the CR/ROM version.

I was able to do the Schedule D (stocks) even tho the higher versions are recommended.  Again, in contrast .... the download Deluxe version does NOT do the Schedule D whatsoever (must go to Premiere or higher) -- so this is another reason to go with the CD/ROM.

On the CD/ROM Deluxe version you can enter your stock sales, and functionality is not broken whatsoever!  Also applies to CD/ROM Basic version too -- I used Basic for Sched D last year and prior years.

Went with Deluxe this year for the 10% gift card bonus -- In contrast, Basic CD/ROM version  is only 5% bonus on the gift card.  So the Deluxe version will be money well-spent, cuz  I'm gonna put a LOT on the Amazon Gift Card, whoa yea!

Also note that State Filing is Not included in this product (and I don't need it).

No problems with the install and no stability issues with the video editing program to date. But I am having significant problems importing media. Apparently, for example, not all MP4 files are created equal as far as this program is concerned. Or MOV files either. Some open. Some dont. I know quite a bit about video formats and I haven't called Sony Tech Support yet because I am trying to figure out the issue son my own.

 This is a nice video editor for beginners or more experienced editors who are looking for simplified workflow to turn out smaller projects faster (assuming you can import your video). The User Interface has a very clean deign and is reasonably intuitive. Making life somewhat easier for newer editors is having a Simple Edit mode and an advanced edit mode.

 I was able to knock out a small, simple project pretty quickly without needing to consult the Help file.

 Sony has produced some interesting add-ons that are available as downloads at modest cost. In my opinion, a few of the add-ons should have been built into the program, but others represent excellent value, so I guess it balances out.

 I admit to being focused on the media imkport problem since files from some of cameras cant be imported without being converted first, which annoys me. Also, I have not ued the auxillary programs yet.

 My initial impression, however, is that the video editor is excellent for new editors and for more experienced editors seeking more efficient workflow. This version won't replace adobe Premiere Pro  and isn't intended to  but it will do a fine job in handling the footage from your cameras and crafting a fairly complex video project without an overly steep learning curve.

 I like it and will be coming back to it once I resolve my media import issues.

I just installed both on my Dell laptops (Lat 6530 and 6510) which I just bought in January.  In PC World, they maintain you can also install those same MS versions in Win8, but I'm so antagonistic to Win8 I've not installed it, yet.  Original review follows below.

==================

Imagine, if you will, the annual How-to-Alienate-the-Customer Meeting in Redmond, Washington, aka 'upgrade' plan, for MS software.

Ms. Snippy (proudly):  Well, we've redesigned the interface yet again, just like aisles in grocery stores, so the customer will be confused, feel stupid; so will subscribe to our paid help.  Yet we added a cute dog to slow the search process, make it harder to search than prior;  we also reduced the number and types of files search can read, and made the Indexing Service more annoying.  We also forced the interface colors to glare blue and glare white, to increase eyestrain. Thus we can truly call this product 'new'.

Mr. Fleece-the-Customer Project Manager (smiling):  Wonderful, Snippy! But is that all?  Those changes won't confuse the customer long enough;  soon they will stop subscribing to our ignorant help hot lines.

Ms. Snippy (bubbling over): Oh, we've done much more.  Starting with, reducing backwards-compatibility with our own earlier software, and popular programs like Lotus 1-2-3 and Adobe Acrobat; so now it will cost those companies more, to sync with our 'new' software.  And less of their own products, will be read by OUR software, just the same!

Mr. Fleece (eyes wide):  aha, so we can blame them for lack of compatibility, and make more money thereby.  Well done, Snippy!

Ms. Snippy (ecstatic):  Well, here's the best part: we create NEW JOBS!  For now ALL the older material must be retyped or reformatted within our own products, thousands of hours of NEW WORK spent on old material which used to be converted in an instant!  That extra work, is good for America!

Mr. Fleece (with the Arm-and-Hammer look):  yes, teaches the customer a lesson that he shouldn't go anywhere but to us!  for all his software needs.

Ms. Nudger (sheepishly):  Um, excuse me.  We've also made our own earlier products incompatible with the 'new' version.  So how do we blame the other software companies, when in fact we also are incompatible with our own products?

Mr. Fleece:  Can't you recognize 'progress'?  It's the policy here to force people to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, never ending, never matching, never fitting the past -- just like DETROIT proudly does with American cars!  You're UNAMERICAN, Nudger; and you're FIRED!

===========

The above fictional conversation is not wholly fictional.  Eleven years ago, my one and only pay-for-help hour spent with a Microsoft employee basically resulted in him admitting Fleece's last lines.  In the name of progress.  I kid you not.  The rest of the fictional conversation is easily deduced by the actual history of MS products.  So too, here with Word 2003, when the elimination of backwards-compatibility, really begins.  Later versions of Office are even worse.  I've tried and rejected them.  But after reading reviews of how Word 2003 allegedly fixed the bugs with respect to right-to-left text (i.e., Hebrew), I wanted to try this.  Yeah, what a mistake!  Two copies I bought, both of them nearly useless!

Why?  Um, if you can't even retrieve your own previous files in the 'upgrade' version, then why upgrade?  Hmmmm?

For every 'upgrade' of Office becomes more and more dysfunctional.  I bought Word 2003 due to the many bugs in Word 2000-2002, but guess what?  Word 2003 TOOK AWAY what was good in those older programs, and substituted even more bugs and dysfunctionality.  That 'progress' continues from Word 2003, onward.  OFFICE and hence Word 2010 is so incompatible, after downloading the trial version in only two hours I was so frustrated, I uninstalled it. With difficulty.

Here's the scam: the 'upgrades' are like the opening dialogue, above.  The 'upgrades' complicate procedures which were simple in earlier versions, especially in Word and Excel, prior to version 2003.  For example, you used to just click on Help, and you actually got a chm file OF Help.  Not now.  Now, the DEFAULT in Word takes you ONLINE.  Takes two hours to figure out how to change that default, so you can get the old help file you're used to.  So too, the ? in a dialogue box USED to function simply: you clicked on the ?, then moved your mouse to the section on the dialogue box you wanted to understand, and got a semi-coherent explanation of that section's function.  Not now.  Now, another dialogue box opens with a lot more text, and you must SCROLL SCROLL SCROLL to find the item you could have gotten in 2 seconds, under the old method.  With no more coherence, of course.  Often, even less.  Help like this:  if the dialogue box says 'make operation operational', of course you have no idea what 'operation' is in view.  So in the old days, you clicked on ? and you got a tool tip which said, 'this function makes the operation, operational'.  That of course elucidated nothing, but at least it was fast.  Now, in Word 2003, you get the same message, but it took you three or four minutes to even FIND the same line of text as in the dialogue box, within the new and de-proved help file.  That is, after you spent two hours figuring out how to turn off the default ONLINE help which of course never helped you, either.

It's not by accident that most law firms still offer backwards-compatible documents for Word97-2003.  They have to.  Legal and accounting stuff has to be kept for YEARS.  Notice the range of the offering.  2003 and prior.  Word 2003, however, is far less desirable than prior versions: its clipboard is worse, its buttons are harder to customize and actually they removed some useful button customizations like Reveal Formatting;  the PERMISSION annoyance (covered below) means you might have to go through all your old documents and establish permissions, even on your own computer (problem on XP Pro, not Home).  And frankly, I don't see any functions which are improved, versus Word 2002.  Only new annoyances.

The usual company retort to complaints like mine, is to deem the customer ignorant of computers, puh!  Balderdash.  I've been working with computers since Trash-80.  I still have my old 286's, and they still work.  Admirably.  So it's not like I'm a computer neophyte, and my business depends on word processing and spreadsheets.  To date, nothing beats Multimate II (a DOS product) for merges, and DOS (not Windows) Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x, for calculations.  All Excel has to offer, is formatting the final product.

To wit:  oh, now in Excel 2003, you can't retrieve Lotus 1-2-3 wk1 files, but get a 'restricted policy' notice.  By the way, this very 'policy' is itself buggy.  If I use XP Home, I don't get the problem.  It only occurs with XP Pro.  See?  MS products don't work with each other.  That lone $90 hour I spent paying for MS help years ago, resulted in this gem of explanation:  each programmer only gets certain subroutines to write.  The programmers are isolated, and don't get to see how the product fits together.  So OF COURSE there will be bugs.  Design requires a wholistic approach, which at MS, is anathema.  Okay, then: their products will waste billions of dollars in customer time trying to work around the bugs.  Not to mention, eventually MS will tank due to such a stupid policy.  But I digress...

Back to the problem: you can't open your own files when you are the administrator?  And you're not told how to get permission?  Oh, wait: you can ONLY get permission if you use Microsoft's ONLINE PASSPORT SERVICE?  Access to your own computer not online, depends on you establishing credentials online? Oh but yes!  You download a silly 'rights management' program which you can't even install, unless you subscribe to NET passport ONLINE, which means to access your own files on your own computer to use them in Office, you have to BE online, establish your credentials, and only THEN can you open your own documents on your own computer.  What drunk thought of that?  And of course, if MS voluntarily ends the PASSPORT program, then you can't even do that convoluted and needless procedure to open your own documents on your own computer offline.

So MS won't even allow you the administrator to control your own computer, with Word 2003. So here's the scam workaround: you have to settle for XP Home, or contact them in Redmond; of course you wait for an hour on the phone, then for $90 per hour they will be happy to spend four more hours 'helping' you to solve THEIR OWN TYRANNICAL BUG.  Of course, the 'help' person at MS knows absolutely nothing about the software, so first you go through irrelevant questions like do you have a virus, in order to eat up time and cost you more money.

Forget the other junk in the Suite.  It works not at all.  The Outlook 2003 was so badly designed I just flat removed it.

Excel is totally retarded, for audit-trail accounting.  Everything about its structure is buggy and arcane.  I spent FOUR HOURS today, just trying to figure out why it wouldn't recognize a labelled number, as a LABEL.  Previous version of Excel had the opposite bug: if you typed in a number, it automatically treated it as a label, unless you put an equals or plus or minus sign in front of the number.  Sheesh.  But at least Excel 2002 and prior, would recognize the label marker and treat what followed AS a label.  (This matters: say you're doing billing like I was, and you wanted to LABEL a billing amount, to keep it out of your totals;  in Excel 2002 and prior, you can do that easily.  But NOT, in Excel 2003, and no FUNCTION formula will let you do it.  More could be said, but then I'll have apoplexy.)

By contrast, old DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x -- which IBM owns now, and won't sell -- along with its add-in (nee: Funk Software) 'Worksheet Utilities' is totally superior, especially for actuarial and other number-intensive, date-intensive, audit-trail-intensive calculations.  Runs in a DOS window in XP, and I'm told by my computer guys that I can get a DOS window in Win7, so might upgrade to Win7.  Whew.  Calculation in our modern computers is instantaneous.  DOS rocks.  So too, that version of Lotus.  Later versions don't work well with dates.  Forget the later Quattro Pro, too.

Excel's only good for formatting the final reports, and even then inanely won't let you store print STYLES without extreme effort: you do it by setting up your windows, print area, then name the whole thing as a CUSTOM VIEW.  Forget macros.

I could spend hours ranting about the flaws in Word or Office Professional, vintage 2010 backwards.  Word is totally incapable of a decent merge, for example.  The trouble you have to go to in order to make merging work in Word, means that unless you've got thousands of records, you might as well do it by hand.  And with thousands of records, count on half of them coming out wrong unless yhou spend thousands of hours designing a very precise database which is thirty times harder to manage, versus the old DOS days.  Unbelievable.  No wonder prices rise so much.  We're all spending downtime trying to get basic word processing functions, to work!

So too, forget Front Page;  it's easier to write your own html code in Word.  Business Contact Manager?  You're better off with pencil and paper!  Access?  Someone on crack designed it. The Photo thingy isn't all that bad, but its bugs abound.  Outlook 2003 is the worst.  They removed all the flexibility of earlier Outlook versions, and of course made the interface completely frustrating, to boot.  Outlook has always been way overcomplicated, but if you have a lot of stuff to juggle and you use it daily (which you must, or you'll forget how) -- it can be helpful.  Simpler is old Sidekick in DOS.  Sigh, you can't store it in the UMB, in Windows.  But it works just fine on an old 486...

So instead of reading only my ranting -- Google on a MS program name, add the word 'sucks' -- you'll find even whole discussion forums devoted to that second word.  Usually such vulgar language is inapt.  But not here.  Every swear word ever invented, belongs to Office products and to MS software in general.  It's deliberately unintuitive, confusing, buggy and mediocre, so you have to subscribe to paid help.  That's the only explanation which makes sense of the data. Same can be said for Adobe, Roxio, Symantec and Corel products.  So MS isn't the only scammer in town.

Go back to DOS software:  its products work well on these faster machines.

UPSHOT:  If you are lonely and want to spend all your free time debugging MS Office gaffes, then buy Word 2003 or Office Professional 2003 et seq. If on the other hand you like me are stuck with Word and want to know the latest version which worked -- though buggy, is manageable -- get Office 2002 or 2000.  Best was Word97, but getting it to work in XP is something of a problem.  Hope you kept your Win98SE machines. :)

At first, we thought the H&R Block software was less buggy, and had less problems, although the user interface and interview portions are somewhat Spartan in their design.

Immediately after Efiling our 1040 return this evening, we noticed a glaring error in our HRB printed return.  The HRB software had calculated a lower refund that it should have - it opted to use the default option of the Itemized Deductions rather than the higher Standard Deduction, and our refund could have been $630 higher.  Put another way, nothing in the HRB software warned us to take the higher Standardized deduction and we missed the little check box as we passed through, and did not notice that the lower itemized deduction had been applied instead.

When I contacted HRB Support by phone this evening, they were apathetic, and did not seem to care about the problem I pointed out to them; about the obvious design flaw that should have been caught during the error check process at the end (as is the case with TurboTax by the way). I asked for the call to be escalated to a supervisor (Edwin) whose faux courtesy did little to soothe the pain that this is the first time EVER that we have had to file a 1040X Amended Return.

""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing.

1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.

2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that ""just works"" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.

3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.

4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.

Windows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and ""just works"". Next to the very secure and stable Linux distributions, you can't go wrong with Windows 2000 Professional.","the best version of Windows, bar none",1158969600,8.0,

That little omission has now been rectified with this truly elegant version for Mac.  Having used AutoCAD in the Windows OS, I was really excited to see what it would be like on Mac, and not only was I not disappointed, but it exceeded my expectations.  This isn't just a ""port over"" from Windows OS code. This version was built from the ground up specifically for Mac, yet looks and functions just like its Windows cousin, only with the flair and style that is Mac. Great pains have been taken to make the Mac version's interface (i.e, menus, dropdowns, etc.) extremely similar to Windows, so getting up to speed is quick, and you'll instantly know your way around.

The one thing you won't be used to is SPEED.  The Mac version rocks when it comes to performance over the Windows version.  I have the Windows version installed on a PC with 8GB of RAM and a quad-core processor.  My MacBook Pro has the exact same RAM and processor but, as all Mac users know, code written on the Mac operates much more efficiently than Windows code. Screen changes, image refreshing, file rendering are noticeably, and impressively, faster. Panning or zooming on an object is no longer a reason to go get a cup of coffee while you wait for the screen to refresh.  I've drank a LOT of coffee with the Windows version.  PDF output is excellent, and fast.

The caveats:

**Unless you've used AutoCAD for a while on the PC already, you'll probably need to buy a third-party book if you need instruction on how to use it.  I was stunned to receive the lowly DVD case with one DVD, and no documentation.  Yes, I know, who includes printed docs anymore, but you would expect for the price that there would be some type of getting started doc that would be user-friendly to newbies.  A good book on using AutoCAD will cost you another couple of hundred bucks which, for some, may add insult to injury.

**Another insult is this version is subscription based, and comes with a one-year subscription. I don't know what the annual subscription will be after that, but I suppose somewhere in the middle of the night 12 months from now, my Mac version will quietly expire, and I'll need to reach for the Amex to bring it back to life.

**The Mac version can only be installed on two Macs, and those two Macs cannot run the program simultaneously. This means, you can run AutoCAD on your desktop MAC at the office, and on your MacBook Pro (you really don't want to run this on anything less than that) and you can share files between the two.  But, you can't be using it at home on the laptop while a colleague is using it at the office.

**Expensive.  Yes, it's a high price tag, but there's really no valid equivalent to this software on the market.  It's not a consumer product, and not even a pro-sumer product, so it's priced for the professional who is doing mid-to-high level design for architecture and product prototyping.

I had Final Cut Pro 5 and it wouldn't allow me to do that - I would have had to upgrade to Final Cut Studio 2.

I have not had any noticeable infiltrations on any of the machines, 1 XP pro laptops 1 XP pro tablet and 1 media PC tower, that it has been installed on.  In the past, I have predominantly used Norton products, but realized that it had a tendency to significantly reduce the performance of all machines I have installed them on.  AV suites are about as much protection as possible, but when my performance is cut almost in half, I had to look for an alternative.  Though I have used many different anti-virus and internet security suites over the years (Kaspersky, Trend Micro, AVG, etc.), for the purposes of this review, I am comparing only McAfee and Norton as I installed McAfee over the Norton installations.

Comparing the two, they have both worked well for me.  The main difference between McAfee and Norton is that McAfee is much more hands off.  Use the installer and the most current package is downloaded and then installed.  Once installed, it does its thing with very little setup or configuration.  Conversely, Norton came with a full version on the cd and after the install it asks to download the latest definitions and updates.  This route of install definitely took longer; and with the prevalence of high speed internet access that isn't that big of a deal --- of course it would be a big deal if you are still on dial up.  Norton also has a lengthy configuration process and while it ""learns"" your habits, pop ups and config questions constantly come on asking you to proceed, block, allow, accept, etc.  Not a big deal if you are fairly comfortable with computers, but people like my dad that only has basic skills were always afraid of doing the wrong thing so the first month I would always get a call asking me what to do.

In short, I like McAfee.  It works well and is easier to install and live with.  I would like a little more control over specific functions and task, that Norton does, but the ease of use and performance increase is well worth the sacrifice.",Comparison of Norton vs. McAfee,1250726400,,

CorelDraw just keeps getting better and better, and this version is the best one yet.

I've been using CorelDraw for years, and for years my fellow digital artists have told me I need to ""upgrade"" to Adobe software. I studied computer graphics on Macs using Adobe programs at a digital-art school, but when I came home I practiced the same things using CorelDraw. There really wasn't much of a difference, except that the Adobe interface was prettier but oddly a little less intuitive.

All my friends pushed me to buy a Mac and get Adobe software. ""It's the only thing artists use,"" they said. ""We just don't use PCs. Macs are designed for creative people, and so is Adobe software.""

""But Adobe programs cost more, and you have to buy several to do the same things as one CorelDraw Suite,"" I replied. ""Some things that come standard in CorelDraw require add-ons in PhotoShop or Freehand, and that means you have to pay even more.""

They pointed out deals for students. I could get Adobe software for about half the retail cost. That made sense for something I needed, but what I already had for less than half the price of one of those programs was already fulfilling my needs. Did I really need to spend that much more to be like everyone else?

I talked to a friend who ran a graphics studio. The artists working under her all worked with Adobe programs ... and she would fix their mistakes in CorelDraw. Then I went to work at a newspaper, where I created illustrations on my PC using scanned images and CorelDraw's Photo-Paint from the CorelDraw Graphics Suite. I exported my images in PNG format, and the layout artist had no problem putting them into pages in the software on his Mac. They looked fine in the newspaper when they were printed.

So while Macs and Adobe might be the industry standard, you won't be left out in the cold if you save your money and choose not to join the crowd.

Two last things:
1. As with all graphics programs, there is a learning curve. However, if you already know one kind well, like PhotoShop, it shouldn't be too hard to adjust to another, like Photo-Paint, which is a part of this suite.

2. CorelDraw tends to try new things with odd numbered releases, so the odd numbered ones tend to be a bit buggier than the even numbered ones. It's usually best to wait for an even numbered suite before you buy.",The most bang for your buck,1271289600,4.0,

Yes, Photoshop does everything but it is also an enormous systems hog and has a huge learning curve.  It also does nothing simply and many times I LIKE taking the easiest course to get from point A to point B.

I devised a test for how well this new program does against the others.  I took the image of a lily which I had photographed.  I previously had tried to turn it to a pleasing mauve in Elements and failed miserably. I put it into this program and within about twenty minutes I had a gorgeous mauve lily ready to save.  I was frankly surprised I had done that well.

Although it has less tools on the toolbar, I discovered by using other features under the menu that I was able to do pretty much anything I wanted to do. Also, it seems that it may have made one tool to do it all rather than making three or four, like Photoshop or Elements does.  For example, the clone tool on this program seemed to do everything for me that I use clone tool and all aspects of the healing tool for in Photoshop and Elements.  However, I do miss a polygon lasso as this program only has the regular lasso. Both Photoshop and Elements have the polygon lasso. Next, I miss the burn, dodge, and smudge tools, again found in both Adobe programs. On the plus side though, there are filters with controls in this program which go beyond the ones in Photoshop and I am eager to work my way through them. For example, there is a new filter called Bloom that does a wonderful job on enhancing images.

The user interface is absolutely gorgeous, the best ever.  I like the way it looks on my macbook screen better than any other image editing program. Everything automatically disappears while I am working on the image too.  It all reappears the moment I am ready to proceed.  I love that feature! It is so intuitive. Plus the shortcuts you use in the Adobe programs are the same in this program.

I think this program has enormous potential and I especially like that it was designed solely with my OS in mind.  I am so tired of products designed primarily for Windows.

This is the first image editing product I've seen that potentially could go the distance against Adobe at least for the non graphic designer market. Only time will tell.

There is one small ""tool bar"" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons. It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.
Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!
Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the ""improved"" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!
To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!
Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)
For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.
I have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case. I believe Microsoft tried to produce something ""different"" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past. If you have the option of staying with an earlier version, DO NOT UPGRADE to this product!",A DOWNGRADE from Office 2003,1211587200,18.0,

Installation of the software on the notebook went well, and I plugged the small GPS unit into a free USB port on my Asus put the netbook on the passenger seat and headed out.

The software interface feels dated; I wasn't entirely impressed with either the design or functionality.  Many functions weren't very intuitive, with multiple panes opening and closing providing different data.  Once I sorted it out and programmed my first trip in though, things got a bit easier.

The GPS unit picked up satellites quickly and easily, besting the GPS unit in my phone as well as a dedicated handheld Magellan unit I had brought for comparison.  My  trip progress was tracked accurately, with a readout of estimated mileage and ETA updated on the fly.  The major problem was finding things nearby.

With freestanding GPS units, it's easy to simply ask it to display nearby gas stations, hotels, etc.  However, there's no way to do this easily with S&T.  The only way to get that information is to go to the turn-by-turn list of directions, figure out which step you are near, select THAT, and then request nearby places of interest.  Not only wasn't it intuitive, it was useless to me: I used my G1 and its GPS unit for that functionality most of the time.  One other problem I had was a few software crashes. I was unable to determine if this was bad code or an underpowered netbook - though mine is easily able to run everything else I've thrown at it.

I suppose if you sat in a room and planned your trip, then loaded those trips as you traveled, this would work fine. Alternatively, if you had a navigator with you running the computer, you might be in ok shape, if not a bit puzzled at times by the interface.

But for use as a GPS on the fly while traveling solo, I'd give it a pass.  It just doesn't provide the ease of use or functionality I want in a GPS.","Good GPS Unit, OK For Planning, Not Great For On-The-Fly",1250553600,3.0,

Norton was easy to install and is intuitive to use. The main screen is setup to be aesthetically pleasing, with a series of bubbles that you can choose from to drill down to more advanced functions. Unlike other virus programs I have used in the past, it does not become intrusive, causing windows to pop up during routine browsing or software installation. Advanced users will want to make use of the customization, in order to remain protected, yet keep Norton from overstepping its bounds. Norton can take care of threats on its own, or it can be set to ask the user what to do when a security risk is found.

One of the most useful features of 360 is that it can be used to easily set up a backup system. Backing up is an important task that many users overlook, so having an automatic tool takes all the thought out of the process. Norton will help you select which files you want to back up (pictures, video, financial files, documents), how big those files are, how often you want to back up, and the destination of the backup system.

-------------------------------------------------

What I like about this software...

+ You can install it on multiple Windows PCs. Despite looking for the answer on the Cyberlink website, I've not found that there is a limited number of installs you can make with the included PC disc. There's also a link to download and install the software with the code on your PC disc if you have a laptop without a disc drive. I've put it on (1) Windows 7 and (2) Windows 10 PCs without issue.

+ You can extract audio from video and save it to a file. So if you want a sound bite, or a song from a movie, you can do it!

+ The PowerDVD Remote by Cyberlink for iOS (iPhone) and iPod Touch) works well and the app is free.

+ Installation was easy and completed within about 1 minute. The prompt to view tutorials was very helpful as in watching them you are introduced to the software's features and how to get started.

+ 30 GB FREE storage on the Cyberlink cloud. (Not sure for how long though?)

+ Compatible with Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.

+ Great DVD player on a PC! TrueTheater enhancement does make a positive difference. Both audio and video are better than expected.

+ Auto memory for where you left off in a movie or a slideshow is a wonderful feature.

+ Comprehensive video and audio format support!

+ It's easy to navigate whether in PC or TV mode.

+ 4K and high frame rate video playback is supported, meaning you don't need extra software for playback.

+ Casting to Roku, Chromecast and Apple TV devices - my favorite feature! If you have stuff you want to share, bring your laptop with PowerDVD 16 Ultra on it and a Chromecast device to your location and you're set.

----------------------------------------

What I wish was better...

-/+ The price is on the high side for not also supporting installation on Mac computers.

-/+ During installation you are given the option to have this program associated with opening video, photos and music by default. Be sure to uncheck the boxes if you don't want the program to take over these functions automatically.

-/+ PC mode and TV mode... why two modes that essentially do the same thing? The menus are slightly different and I'm guessing it has something to do with the integration of the remote app.

-/+ With Windows Media Player and a TV tuner in my PC I was able to use my hard drive as a DVR. I don't see how to do this with this software, but perhaps it's there and I just don't see it? There's a lot to learn about this software.

----------------------------------------

While I use VLC to view videos and Windows Photo Viewer or Photoshop Elements to view photos, and I rarely use anything but iTunes for my music library - this software will change that on my Windows 10 laptop PCs. It's just easier to use, and has a prettier interface with it all right there. The addition of the 'casting' feature is what really makes it a winner for me as I'm sure I'll use it a lot.

Word is effectively the standard format for documents in the American business world, and most of my employers use Exchange as their email server. Therefore, what I most want from my office suite is something that 1. works well reading and writing Word documents and 2. provides a way to connect to my employer's Exchange server and properly handle its calendars, meeting requests, etc.

Office 2008 for Mac just does that! I pulled up and edited my old PC Office-created Word resume with no problem, and haven't experienced major issues reading any other Word document yet. The Exchange capabilities of Entourage work like a charm, let you accept and send meeting requests and generally enable you do all of the things you're used to doing with Outlook, but can't currently do with Mac Mail. The simple Excel spreadsheets I used for timesheets pulled up in Mac Excel without a hitch and Messenger and Powerpoint are nice-to-haves.

This is probably the best OS from Microsoft yet and while this OS is not perfect, it's very stable, secure and less resource intensive than Vista. It is also very fast, the UI is very appealing and has some great security features.

Pros:

Fast.

Looks Fantastic with Aero Glass.

Compatible with pretty much.. well just about anything from earlier version of Windows.

Better Video format capabilities allowing you to watch just about any video without any issues like in the early versions of Windows (98, XP)

Great OS to game with, XP was 'pretty good' and i had issues with Vista but Windows 7 is suburb!
Improved start menu, you can search for your less used programs, files and just about anything all within the start menu. And it's not full screen!

Cons:
Takes up more resources than XP most likely requiring a new desktop.

Windows Media Player will sometimes freeze up, i really don't know what causes it but it will often do it when cold booting your desktop and i also have 2 hard drives on the desktop with WMP set to both (music on both drives) so i'm not sure if it's just doing indexing or something but either way it gets to be a hassle sometimes, this has happened to a few systems with different hardware so i don't know whats up with that.

Windows update. Yes, this thing gets on my nerves and if you have Windows Defender enabled it will most likely have you update daily or every other day. One of the biggest gripes i have with the updates is that either if you reinstall your system (or install a new system) you will most likely be doing updates for about an hour or more and it drives me crazy when it's asking to restart the computer. The updates should be a bit more silent and do all the updates that require restart all at once. I had to also put the updates to manually install as otherwise the OS will prompt for a restart which will take place if you don't do anything or hit postpone. It doesn't allow you to manually restart when you are ready. Often i will have music playing and once the computer restarts no more music so that is a big minus for me, the updates should be more silent and either have the restarts set to manual or a better way of doing updates that require restart.

Cost. For what Windows 8 is worth and the direction MS chose with 8, it's really just sad that Windows 7 is at the price as it is. But in the end you get a true version of Windows 7 and not a butchered version of it, it's practically worth it to get a copy of Windows 7 versus getting Windows 8. Home Edition of Windows 7 is really all most need and that is a bit cheaper than Professional or Ultimate. Even though Windows 7 is only supported through 2020, it's all most really want out of an OS and you won't have to mess with 3rd party alternatives just to keep your start menu. Windows 8 is not faster, it does save on system resources better than Windows 7 but not by much. If you have problems with Windows 7 performance i would check the hardware before assuming it's Windows 7 itself. It is very fast and there is no notable difference in speed between Windows 7 & 8.

If you want to avoid UI headaches with Windows 8, just get Windows 7. You still have 7 years of support and who knows, if it's popular and no one is getting Windows 8 or 9 or whatever, MS will have no choice but to extend the lifecycle of Windows 7, like they did with XP. If you like Windows 7 and don't really care for the direction 8 is going towards, i suggest getting a copy of 7 so MS will restore the start menu and allow desktop users the freedom of choosing desktop UI or a tablet UI. I for one don't see a need of a tablet UI on my desktop. It's like trying to put wheelbarrow tires on a truck. It could be done if you do some tweaking but in the end it just looks silly and it's not practical. That's how i feel about Windows 8. Why bother tweaking Windows 8 to look like Windows 7, when Windows 7 itself has all you need and more. Windows 8 doesn't even have native DVD playback, you gotta download and possibly purchase WMC to get it back and they are removing WEI and the backup features so Windows is becoming less and less like an OS and more like an app center device. Even if you prefer having XP over Windows 7, if your system is capable you can dual boot with zero problems with Windows 7 and XP. Just remember to have XP installed first and a hard drive with the XP partition up to half of what you have or about 20GB and 80GB (35GB minimum) for Windows 7. That way you have the best of both worlds. Windows 7 is great for both home, professional and business users.","Worth getting over Windows 8, XP users should upgrade to 7",1375228800,,

I installed MS Office Professional 2000 and 2002 on two Dell Windows 7 Professional 32-bit laptops.  The 2003 is installed on a third Dell Windows 7 Pro, but is an Optiplex.  Get 2002 or 2000, as 2003 (especially in Outlook) is very annoying.  The latter also removes backwards compatibility UNLESS you download the UnlockExcel.reg and UnlockWord.reg files from MS (free download).  And, be sure not to accept the MS Office 2003 bizillion updates for alleged problems.  Again, 2002 and prior are a better buy (more customizable, more add-ins, nicer), unless you have some specific need for 2003.

Rest of the review follows below, without further edit.

UPDATE 9/9/12: This review is long and unwieldy, sorry; it covers not only the upgrade version listed here; but also, this review compares full versions of Office 2003 and prior.  I'll be editing this review ad hoc, too.  The problem here is the LACK OF BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY imposed by later versions of Windows or Office.  So it becomes very complicated, to explain the variant problems with different MS versions of Office, and how to make them work.  If you have older files, you have to deal with these complex problems.  Hence this review:  it's mind-boggling.  MS has now made computing far more difficult than necessary.

According to Windows 7 Compatibility advisor, Office 2002 and prior are NOT compatible with Windows 7.  But according to users in the PC World forums, you can still use Office 2000-2002, especially Word and Excel, but might have problems with Outlook 2000, IF IF IF you configured it to run your email (the email passwords won't store, when Outlook 2000 is run from Win7 OS).  Google for PC World Office 2000, 2002 and for Windows 7.  Replace 'PC World' with 'MS Answers Forums' to see the same issues discussed in MS Answers Forums.  Pity that MS won't support its own products, when the newer versions of the same products, are worse.

SHORT SUMMARY: The #1 reason to buy this older (pre-2003) software, now that it's outdated -- is for backwards-compatibility.  And, some of its older functions work better than in Word 2003 et seq.  And, if you migrate to Win 7, you'll lose Outlook Express (one of the few stable and good programs MS has written, so OF COURSE they get rid of it).  So you'll have to learn Microsoft Outlook, anyway.  This matters most, because Outlook after version 2000, stinks.  Your other alternative will be SmartSuite version 9.8 and prior, from IBM.  Those versions are also backwards-compatible.  Latest SmartSuite might not be able to read DOS files from Win7, IBM told me.  But SmartSuite itself, is able to run in Win7, per MS' own listing of 'compatible' programs.  So try buying here in Amazon, earlier versions of SmartSuite, which run between $6 - $50 (versions 9.8 and prior).  I'm testing those, so am writing reviews of SmartSuite as well (review is still in progress).  The latest version of SmartSuite can only be purchased at IBM, so far as I can tell, but it's still called version 9 (but is later than the versions sold here at Amazon).  The latest version costs about $400, so you'd be smart to get an earlier version here in Amazon, see if you like it.

For later versions of Word (or SmartSuite) can read Word 2000-2002 files, as well as files in other older programs for Windows (SmartSuite can read more older files, even from DOS).

Why is that important?  These older Windows programs thus become BRIDGE programs to enable later MS software to read word processing and spreadsheet software which is PRE-2000.  In short, you open those older files in Word/Excel 2000-2002, and then CONVERT them into Word/Excel 2000-2002.  At which point, later MS software can work with the same file.  Else, it's toast. So if you have many old files, you need Office XP 2000 or 2002, as a 'bridge' back to your old files.  So now the question:  WHICH?  2000, or 2002?  No simple answer. Depends on what Office products you're using now, and whether you use Acrobat. The rest of this review is on these complex questions.

WARNING:  Windows 7 will not work with Outlook 2000.  Lots of complaints about that, in MS Answers forums.  Problem with passwords;  they won't store in Outlook 2000, when operated in Windows 7, because Windows 7 no longer allows you to use email directly from your computer;  you have to use it in conjunction with Windows Live mail -- a horrible thing.  (Why MS keeps on wrecking its own older-but-good features, is beyond my comprehension.)

So if you're planning to use Outlook 2000 in Windows 7, DO NOT install it with email enabled.  Maybe then it will work in Windows 7, because people have told me they can get Office 2000 to work even in Windows 8, but without Outlook email enabled.  So maybe you can install it and only in the new Windows version, enable email?  I don't know, but it's worth a shot.

====== OFFICE 2000 versus 2002 ======

Office 2000 works best in Win98SE and XP Home.  Office 2002 runs better in XP Professional; because the service packs convert Office 2000 into Word 2002 -- with bugs. So if like I did, you then reinstall 2000 to get rid of the bugs, the reinstallation conflicts with the updates. So that problem is solved if you upgrade to Office version 2002.

BUT BEWARE:  select CUSTOM installation of 2002. If you're on Windows XP Professional OS, DO NOT UPGRADE OUTLOOK 2000 to 2002.  So don't install Outlook 2002, if you're using Outlook 2000.  That's what I did (see last three paragraphs of this review).

====== OUTLOOK 2000 versus later editions ======

Outlook 2000 still beats the competing PIM and other calendar management software 'out there' for Windows, if you have a lot of recurring events in your year, i.e., you are an tax accountant, actuary, tax lawyer who deals with annual IRS deadlines.  Outlook is too much hassle to use, unless you have a lot of legal or other deadlines which you must track annually.  Same would be said if you are a buyer or supplier of regular shipments.  Buggy and cumbersome though Outlook is, once you properly set it up for recurring events/appointments, they keep on going forever.  Holidays, not so good: the list is stale-dated after a few years;  it's a hassle to go to MS to update your holidays, but they do provide updated lists (current one runs 2007-2012).  I just don't use them, have a paper calendar for that stuff.

Here's how I use it:  your usage will of course differ, but you can tell the PATTERN, and then adapt for your needs.  Key here is RECURRING DEADLINES.  Everyone has recurring deatlines.  Outlook shines in that respect.  So (as stated again below), a) I keep a thin wireback 8.5 x 11 paper calendar for basics on holidays, and workload planning.  Easy to store in the files, easier then to get a sense of where to look for stuff in Outlook.  Next, b) I programmed legal deadlines in Excel based on the client year end, because in pensions you end up having six or seven separate deadlines a month, centering around the 15th  and the end of the month, based on the Plan or client fiscal year end.  It's a nightmare.  So that master list of deadlines based on year end, helps a great deal.  Finally, c) in Outlook I then plotted a generic calendar by year end, so the deadlines show as 'events' in my calendar each day, week, month.  So Outlook is a glorified alarm clock.  Hassle to program, but easier than using a PDA or cellphone.  (Sidekick is next best, but you can't really run it properly in a DOS window, after Win98SE.)

A client is likewise an 'event' keyed to that particular year end.  Because in my business, the penalties are high for missing deadlines.  IRS almost always forgives the penalty if you've good reason for being late, but no one wants to go through that angst.  Hopefully this paragraph gave you ideas you can extrapolate for your own usage.

You might want to know about printing.  You can print any configuration you'll likely want, but remember that the longer the timeline per print job, the smaller the font needs to be, and the harder it will be to get decent output.  Daily, weekly, monthly works well.  A whole year can be done, but it's not useful.  You can configure the day/week/month with filters to create a blank calendar.  But that will cost you more time than if you just bought one.

Frankly, you'll waste time to print calendars.  The minute you print them, you'll find something you need to change.  So better to go paperless, if you need something to distribute: for this, you print to pdf.  Lots of good pdf printers out there, and you probably already have one on your machine.  My favorite is Smart PDF Creator Pro, but I also have Acrobat 9 (the latter creates the smallest file size of any pdf print program I've seen).  So you 'print' to the pdf printer on your machine, saving paper, time and guilt when you find, five seconds later, that the format is screwy or you left something out.  Outlook also exports to devices:  here it might matter that you use Outlook 2003, depending on your device.  Many more devices are configured to interface with Outlook, than with the other PIM software 'out there'.  It's usually a hassle to set up the first few times, because the names in your device don't match the names in Outlook, so you go through trial-and-error finding out which OUTLOOK names 'port' to your device.  But in the end, it is worth the effort.

Frankly, the old At-A-Glance monthly or weekly calendars are great.  But the problem is, if you have a lot of complicated recurring items you'll later need to SEARCH for, the paper method is no good.  So I keep paper for just the basics (like holidays and planning out my workload), but record the details in Outlook.  Stuff done stays in Outlook forever if you want it to, and you can archive anything for any period, manually or automatically (pick manual, never trust MS automated anything).

Outlook 2000 is the best version.  It's 'views' are very configurable;  it's extremely buggy (as is true of all MS products), but is better than later versions of Outlook. On XP Home, Outlook 2002 will 'obey' the Outlook 2000 settings you have, but you lose future 'view' configurability.  Outlook 2003 will not recognize the Outlook 2000 settings on XP Home; nor will Outlook 2002 on XP Professional OS.  I don't know whether the settings will be recognized on Win7, since I won't upgrade to that terrible, new OS.  (Win 7 is still VISTA, but with some corrections.)

Outlook 2000 can display custom-sized and positioned units, all on the same 'page': tasks, calendar, etc.  For example, you can widen or narrow dimensions;  say, Notes and Tasks alongside a daily or weekly calendar.  Again, THE reason to get Outlook, is its ability to set recurring events, and link them to notes, tasks, and journalling.  Bugs all have workarounds.  Since this is software you'd use daily, you'll get used to the workarounds.

(Old Borland Sidekick, and the old Lotus Metro were less buggy, but also less configurable.  Forget WordPerfect's PIM.  All business contact management software, stinks.  Been there, done that, have the war wounds.)

By contrast, Outlook 2002 (in XP Pro) et seq. only allow one view at a time, Calendar OR Notes OR Tasks. You must open new windows to view, say, Notes and/or Tasks alongside each other; of course you must resize the windows each time. So you're constantly stuck with moving them around.

In short, the last viable version of Outlook, is 2000.  Part of its viability ports over when you upgrade in 2002 in XP Home; but only data is ported over for Outlook 2003, which is utterly dysfunctional.  For example, your 'contacts' begin with REAMS of BLANKS, and there is no option for NAME fields.  What drunk designed that ????  The only way you can deal with it is to sort DESCENDING, or GUESS how many BLANKS you must first delete before you can reach the 'A' in contacts.  God forbid you click on any of the letters (which are supposed to be address-book-tabs), and above all don't click on 123, because then you can't sort at all -- well, until you leave 'Contacts', at which point when you return, your names are necessarily bass-ackwards.  But at least then you can see how many BLANKS you have to delete, and then reset sort to ascending.  Still, you can't organize FIELDS in Contacts.  Oh, wait -- you can specify the fields, but you can't SEE them, and there is no 'current view' available listing NAMES first.  None of this hassle applied in older versions of Outlook.  Unbelievable.

But finally, Outlook 2003 allows you to specify a certain folder to open on startup (i.e., your calendar, instead of that useless Outlook Today with too much white space and no configurability).  In Outlook 2000, you specify this by selecting Tools Options Other Advanced Options button, then pick what you want to display at startup from the drop-down box. (Sorry for the arcane step names.  Clarity is not, an MS forte.)

Outlook 2003 imposes problems when editing tasks, i.e., the highlighter seems to be on one task though you've clicked on a different one, so you'll think you delete the HIGHLIGHTED one; but instead you deleted the task on which your CURSOR (not mouse), resides.

Something must be wrong with the water, in Redmond WA.

Outlook 2002 et seq, FORCE TWO LINES OF ICONS.  You can't uncheck that Options box. When installing In XP Professional, it crashes, then tells you it can't use your prior version settings or your store, would you like to use the default. If you say no, the program quits. If you say yes, it wipes out your prior settings, and you have to do them all over: that's a week's work.

Same 'week' cost is true for Outlook 2000, but when you get it configured rightly, it's a decent program;  it has a nice PDA transfer capability, is easy to import and export to other formats.

====== PHOTO EDITOR 2000 versus later editions ======

DO NOT UPGRADE THE PHOTO EDITOR, either.  The 2000 version is much more full-featured.  The 2002 replacement isn't bad, but it's not as good as the year 2000 version.

====== OTHER OFFICE PROGRAMS (excepting Word and Excel) ======

Business Contact Manager, Front Page, Power Point and Access are useless programs, all glitch and no gain.  You might need Access, though, as many other non-MS programs, use its structure and features.  MS Power Point can result in a pretty slide show, but in Windows Movie Maker you can do more, and more easily.  (Pity Microsoft is so short-sighted, it won't modernize WMM.  MS is losing profits, by not modernizing it.  Again, the MS programs that are actually USEFUL, get scant MS attention.  The programs we NEED to be useful as well but are so buggy you itch for a gun, are 'upgraded' to be more buggy, still.)

Document Imaging and Scanning is marginally better in Office 2002, can be quite useful.  The default tiff file is easy to manipulate, small in size, and most older scanners can thus 'talk' to MS Document Imaging (i.e., the Brother line of MFC).  You have to tweak the MS settings each time; but especially for older scanners and files, these programs are a godsend.  They are somewhat easier to use than Acrobat and PaperPort, but operate along much the same lines.  Like MS, Acrobat is phasing out backwards-compatibility.

====== WORD and EXCEL 2000 and 2002 versus later editions ======

Acrobat can't work with Word post-2002, though it claims compatibility.  It can't work with Word 2000, per its own website (see my review on Acrobat 9, here in Amazon.)

So that leaves Word 2002 and Excel 2002.  GET THEM, if you ever used Win98SE or even Win 3.1 -- and thus have old computer files from that time and prior.  Office 2002 is the last MS version to support backwards compatibility with the powerhouse software of yesteryear (Word Perfect, Quattro Pro, Lotus 1-2-3, Ami, etc).  Later versions ELIMINATE backwards-compatibility; and worse, impose a 'restriction policy' you can't override without screaming (see my review of Word 2003 in Amazon).

So you will need Office 2002 or 2000 to READ older files.  Moreover, older software CANNOT SEARCH the drive. WordPerfect through X5 cannot search its own files on a disk.  Only can search its own files within a directory of a disk.  Windows, by contrast, can't read WordPerfect files to search for text.  This was not a problem in 98SE, but is a problem now.  So if you don't have some 'bridge' software that CAN read those old files, you're stuck.

If you're on XP Professional OS, then old spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3 wk1's, must be converted via an older version of Excel; to enable a later version of Excel, to read the file.  In XP Home (but NOT Professional), Office 2003's Excel CAN read Lotus 1-2-3 files, but later versions of Excel, cannot;  because, in later versions, the wk1 format is deemed dangerous, and you can't fix the Excel default to accept that format.  So, you'd have to convert the wk1 to an Excel format. This is especially true, if you want your family/friends/clients to read wk1 files.

Any version of Office is mediocre, buggy; what automation they should allow, they prohibit.  What automation they impose, wrecks your work. For example, DEFAULTS at installation involve 'autoformat' and 'update style', which on the surface, sound harmless and even beneficial. But if you don't spend hours examining and unchecking these and other defaults prior to creating an important document, you'll have regrets.

Example: say you install, didn't check the defaults, and start to write a document. You create bulleted lists. When you've reached page 18, you decide to reformat the indentation and type of bullets on THAT page.  YOU think you're only changing the format of the latest bullet list.  Surprise surprise -- ALL your previous bulleted lists, ALSO changed to CONFORM to your latest 'auto update style'.

So everything's bass-ackwards with MS software:  before you do anything, you must carefully review every default setting, and figure out how to change it.

So TURN OFF ALL AUTOMATED FUNCTIONS just after installation.  Before you create any document, call up each program and examine its Options and Customize and Autoformat.  It will take all day to figure out what you must turn off or on. Then hit the SAVE (floppy disk) icon to save, without naming the document/spreadsheet.  For that first document/spreadsheet which comes up, is the DEFAULT.  Word's default is Normal.dot, and Excel's default is Book1.xls.  But you won't see the former's name when you open Word;  instead, it labels as Doc1.doc;  but it IS, Normal.dot.  So make your changes to the Options (including Color, for Excel), then hit the SAVE (floppy disk) icon to save it IN the default.

So always have a backup copy before you edit in Word or Excel 2002.  Never trust that what you edited, was all that changed.  Read the entire document over.

What about their vaunted templates?  Yecccch.  And what if you design one of your own?  Well, here's the problem: you can't SEE the formatting so if you backspace, you just wiped it out.  Thankfully, there's 'Reveal Formatting' (in 'Format' menu, or separately moveable as an icon -- tricky thing to create it).  So if your Formatting is REVEALED (by a frame on the right side of your document) -- as you type, you can see what formatting is used for that line.  This is far better than Word Perfect's stupid Reveal Codes, but the latter at least smartly warns if you're deleting a 'style' or 'format'; or (at least in WP 9) flat presumes you only mean to delete text.  Now if only WP would get rid of auto-formatting for a printer hooked up to your system...

Word is not so smart.  It could be MADE to be smart, if they souped up their current option to 'show formatting marks' to INCLUDE the style identifiers.  So you can't see the STYLE, except via Reveal Formatting' frame at right of your document.

It is easy to change and add styles, but spend the hour or two it takes to figure out how to add those styles to Normal.dot, because a changed style only 'stays' with the document you edit.  Same problem is true for Excel, but Excel allows you to always COPY to and from Book1.xls, as you work.  This matters a bunch, for MS default colors are egregious.  In Excel but not Word, you can change the colors, save them to Book1.xls, and then 'copy' them into whatever other worksheet you later open.  Else, any colors you change (using Tools Options Color tab), are only good for that worksheet and maybe for that SESSION.  (It's quirky: sometimes my Tools Options Colors modifications for a worksheet; save; and sometimes not, though I always go through the same steps, and have been doing this for years.)

=== OTHER TIPS ===

A.  In Word, check the box in General tab which asks to be prompted to update the default template, 'Normal.dot'.  Else, any changes you make in program function (i.e., icons or options), won't be preserved once you close the program.  Similarly, if you goofed up your settings during a session, when prompted to update at close program, you can select 'no'; thus your goofups won't be saved. :)

B.  Word is notorious for not enabling underlined blanks.  So to make blank underlined spaces, select Tools Options, then select the Compatibility tab, and check off 'draw underline on trailing spaces'.  Then hit the 'default' button at lower right, and click Yes.  You've just enabled underlined blanks in all future documents. To enable them in past documents: repeat the foregoing steps, after having opened each such other document.  The other way to do it, is to tap out your spaces, end them with punctuation, then paint UP TO the punctuation mark you made.  Word will then draw the underline -- BECAUSE that punctuation mark is on the same line.  Weird.

C.  Comments in Word are incredibly stupid.  You're better off making footnotes or endnotes or objects, since you can optionally hide these from printing.  Bookmarks are a great alternative, since you can bookmark a section, so when the person clicks on it, can be redirected to the comment on some page not to be printed, then use the 'Web' Menu's back or forward buttons, to return back to where he was reading.  Comments in Excel are even more stupid, and no matter how you set them, a) you can't set a DEFAULT NOTE STYLE so are stuck with the ungainly defaults the stupid programmers impose; b) every time you load the worksheet, when you go to EDIT the comments, your comment on edit might be MILES AWAY from the cell (though anchored to the cell, properly readable as a comment).  I've spent hours slowly moving some edited comment which is anchored, say, to column E, but when opened for edit is somehow suddenly the size of a thin line, and way over in column FN, where no worksheet cells are active.  Doesn't matter whether you set the comment to move and resize with the cell, or move but not resize (no reason NOT to move the comment for a cell).  Each single comment must be individually formatted, but all formatting options are available.

D. In Excel, to make the Print Preview show color, select a PDF printer in Page Setup, and make sure that 'black and white' is NOT checked in Page Setup Sheet tab.  This enables you to print to pdf file, and keep the colors.  A black-and-white printer will print colors as shades, anyway.  So you don't need to do anything special.  (Older printers couldn't print shades, so the 'black-and-white' option in Page Setup Sheet is something of a holdover.  Any laser printer I've worked with, naturally recognizes color as a shade of gray.  If you have a color printer, generally you won't want to print black-and-white, either, as black ink is more expensive for color printers.)

E.  Editing text in Excel actually allows you full formatting options.  Edit in the formula bar, and when you want to bold or color or highlight only a specific portion of the text, then do it like you would in Word: select the text then pick whatever formatting you want to apply to the selection.  You can also conditionally format cells, but it's buggy and limited.  3-D type function is easy enough, where in one tab you reference another worksheet by tab name -- what's hard, is that the instructions don't make it clear, how to do this.  It's TABNAME!Cellname  -- be sure to include the exclamation.  Cellname can be either a named range or an address.  If a named range, be sure you've allowed 'accept labels in formulas', in the Tools Options Calculation tab. This is especially important if you're importing a spreadsheet with named ranges (i.e., from Lotus 1-2-3).  If you don't allow those 'labels', ALL YOUR NAMED RANGES ARE CONVERTED TO CELL ADDRESSES INSTEAD, AND YOU CANNOT RENAME THEM.  So says Excel help.  I've not tested that warning for accuracy.

F.  Else, in either 2000 or 2002, the footnotes, endnotes, section headers, table of contents, etc. are cumbersome but useful.  The 'styles' are quirky;  sometimes a backspace while working on a document, undoes or changes the style to something bizarre.  Bookmarks are handy. Customize your icons, to save time later.  In Word/Excel 2002, they insanely group the icons so that too much space is used.  So to end that problem, you must move the icons around to make them fit in the top window line (next to 'Help');  then, fit the rest of the icons so that they only take up ONE line. This fixing, takes hours.  Again, the stupid DEFAULTS pay no attention to customer need, usage, or even common sense.

G.  Word can't merge well with a database.  Comma-delimited or a text file is all it really knows.  But WordPerfect, is even more cumbersome and glitchy.  After years of trying to get either program to merge well, I fell back to my old DOS Multimate Advantage II.  I use old DOS Sidekick on a 486, to create a paste file which then runs the merge.  There ought to be a way to do the same thing in either Word or WordPerfect, but I've not found it.  (IBM's SmartSuite version 9.8 backwards, claim to enable real merging with a named range in a spreadsheet, even with DOS Lotus 1-2-3.  I'm testing that claim, now.  Will post its results in my SmartSuite review here in Amazon.)

====== SUMMARY AND INSTALLATION TIPS ======

SUMMING UP: On the whole, Office 2002 or 2000 is good enough for basic functions like a letter or a simple spreadsheet; for pretty colors but minimal functionality. Excel's ability to do complex calculations -- especially with dates -- is awful. However -- very ironic -- if you programmed the functions in DOS Lotus 1-2-3, the pre-2003 versions of Excel recognize them correctly, and suddenly can handle dates and other complex calculations.  In short, to make Exel really excel, you need DOS Lotus.  (Oddly, Lotus Release 3-5 for Windows, can't handle these calculations well.  SmartSuite did seem to recognize/calculate the functions correctly, when I uploaded a DOS Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet into SmartSuite version 9.6 and 9.1.)

Hence the need for Office 2002 or 2000, in order to 'read' your wk1 files, and make Excel, useful.  (Years ago I begged IBM to re-release DOS Lotus 1-2-3 -- they own its rights, now -- and never got an answer.  So the only way you can get DOS 1-2-3 version 2.x, is to buy it from the secondary market, i.e., some 'vintage software' warehouse.  Check here in Amazon, maybe someone's selling it.)

Again, Office 2002 runs more smoothly than 2000, in XP Pro;  but Outlook in 2002 is inflexible, compared to the 2000 version.  There are also more add-ins created for 2000.  Another flipside: 2002 is compatible with Acrobat 9 and X, but 2000 is not.  Not to worry: buy Smart PDF Creator Pro, which can what Adobe can do for a much lower price; and will work with these older MS Office programs.  So I just use Smart PDF Creator Pro with pre-2002 MS Office (and anything else).

Also, get the CONVERTERS, so that 2002 (or 2000) can read and use LATER versions of Word and Excel (like xlsx and docx extensions).  The converters do work.  Google on fileconverters.exe , to get the download from Microsoft.  That's its program name.

So now you're looking at a hybrid installation, Word 2002 and Excel 2002, but older versions of Outlook and Photo. On XP Pro OS, I installed Office 2003, over 2000; then uninstalled 2003, because it's so clunky and dysfunctional; then installed 2002; then uninstalled Outlook 2002, then reinstalled ONLY Outlook 2000 (to a different directory).  Works well, and all my overrides of the defaults, still work.  Will do the same for Photo 2000, later.  I always prefer the full version of the software to upgrades.  I hope you know, that even the upgrade version IS a full version.  But then you might have copyright concerns later.  Best to buy each 'upgrade' as a full version, so you can continue to separately use the old version, on some other machine.  Here, you've seen how that might be needful.

Alternative is to have one machine with 2000, and the other with 2002.  So my XP Pro machine, has the above hybrid;  my XP Home OS netbook, still has Office 2003; which was installed over Office 2000.  My other XP Home desktop, has Office 2002 installed over 2000.  And an old Win98SE laptop, still has 2000.  In short, to assure backwards-compatibility, I have multiple computers from 286 forward;  these run on DOS, Win98SE, XP.  And in case I need it, I have the older programs, too -- like Lotus, Multimate, Word Perfect, Word 97, etc.  Still have Win95 OS, too.  Even, Win 3.1 and 3.11.

This way, you can read files from older software going all the way back to the 1980's.  You know: when Noah was born. :)",BUY for backwards-compatibility with older computer files,1344556800,,

Both objects imported on their own layers and I quickly animated the figure across the background. Anime Studio has the most intuitive time bar of any animation program I have worked with (including Flash and Photoshop) and I like this one the best.

I also liked the drawing tool which I think is much better than the bezier tools in other programs (although it is similar in many respects).

I have previously used a Garman GPS 60cs for hiking and such, but even as it's great for tracking in the wilderness it doesn't have near the detail that newer, larger, more street driving, oriented GPS's have.  But, it has a good signal and is pretty rugged.  That's the comparison.  The USB GPS provided took a bit bit longer than my Garmin to find the location, but when it did it was pretty surprisingly accurate.  It was very easy to install on my XP laptop, and really worked well in tracking movement and location.  The first time I plugged it in I was in the living room of a 1st floor apartment.  The signal didn't seem to go through the walls very well, and it couldn't pick anything up. That's to be expected.  Outside that location, everything worked perfect.  Easily linked up with the Streets & Trips.

A lot of details have already been given about Streets and Trips itself. I have used Garmin's software--both their North America Streets version and their Western National Parks/Forests version.  I've also become quite a fan of google maps, with occasional use of the other versions.  The major benefit, of course, to Streets and Trips is that unlike Google or the others it doesn't depend on an internet connection.  The major benefit, of course, of another Garmin or other type of GPS is that even this version packaged with the GPS is significantly cheaper--if you have a laptop already.

The software is easy to use and intuitive.  I need to poke around more but I've been pretty satisfied so far. The list of interesting places is very good, as is the overall maps and associated tools. I've not used previous versions of Streets and Trips, so I can't compare this particular version to previous ones.

The one big issue I have with it, that has me using Google a lot in short, one-stop trips is that there doesn't seem to be a way of rerouting the directions.  With Google, a little cursor click and move can shift the route to something that might be preferred for whatever reason. Living in the LA area, as I do, there are a lot of ways to get from here to there, and a lot of reasons why what might seem on paper to be the best isn't at all the best.  The only other downside isn't to do with the software, but instead having to bring my laptop with me places.  Meaning this really is something that I'd use a lot for longer trips, but not as much for the shorter ones.

- Stability is poor.  The system frequently blue screens (crashes) or, more commonly, hangs.  It's not a hardware problem, because both systems experienced these issues, and neither system has any issues running XP.  Vista Media Center slowly degrades over time (one of the computers is my living room DVR) until it is unusable without a hourly reboot (seriously!)
- Speed - I play a lot of games, and Vista is consistently and significantly slower on every single game I've tried.  The difference is significant, even WITH the very latest ""Vista Certified"" video and sound drivers.  Then, there are games that crash on Vista, but have no issues on XP.  You can say ""Well, they were tested to work with XP"", and you'd be right, but I'd rather be running an OS that games were tested with.  And the DirectX 10 effects, which only Vista supports, are very ho-hum - they're not worth the performance hit, in my opinion.  For an example, check out the Crysis DirectX 9 vs. DirectX 10 comparisons on the net.
- Hardware support - this really is not Microsoft's fault, but it is still an issue.  Many hardware manufacturers quietly refusing to release drivers for their existing hardware, in an effort to force people to buy new hardware for Vista support.  That's totally not Microsoft's fault - but make sure your devices are Vista compatible, BEFORE you buy Vista.  Microsoft has a  good compatibility guide on their website for this.  Scanners, printers, music players, phones, and wireless network gear are the gadgets with the worst Vista driver support, as are notebooks not specifically ""designed for Vista"".

I'm not saying you should NOT buy Vista, but if you do, be prepared for the problems you will encounter.  It might be better for a business user who is buying all new Vista compatible hardware.","Stability, speed, hardware support are poor",1218240000,3.0,

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

2922,4131,4131,3.0,False,"11 12, 2009",A1QOK9LU90ACF7,B002ABMVD6,,Centriculous,"QUICK SUMMARY:  A richly-featured, low-cost program is a great introduction into animation, but the program doesn't do much to help new users learn the craft of 2-D animation.

I selected Anime Studio Debut mostly for my kids' sake (teen and pre-teen).  Since earlier this year, they've all enjoyed using a digital camera and Windows Movie Maker to create movies, especially Lego-based movies using Lego-built characters, vehicles and movie sets.  Anime Studio seemed like something they'd enjoy using.  Okay, and I'll admit I was intrigued, too.

In reality, I think the program offers a lot of value for the money, but the implementation for a ""Debut"" program -- one where no prior knowledge of animation is required or expected -- left a lot to be desired.  Although the makers offer a very thorough tutorial to help new users explore the program, I found it to be tiresome switching back-and-forth between the PDF-based, 41-page tutorial document and the actual program.  I prefer the more elegant way of learning a new program where the program itself uses wizards to hand-hold me through the learning process.  For instance, when I learned Sony Vegas Movie Studio earlier this year, its wizards got me using a program that is certainly no less complicated than Anime Studio, and perhaps is more so.  Whereas I continue to enjoy learning how to use Vegas, my enthusiasm for Anime Studio waned quickly.

My older, pre-teen daughter and I were both frustrated at the lack of context-sensitive help or menus in Anime Studio.  I like programs that let me right-click anywhere I happen to be, and a context-sensitive menu pops up with appropriate suggestions for what I'm doing at that moment.

I will credit Anime Studio Debut as being a ""fun"" program.  My pre-teen daughter especially has enjoyed manipulating the template characters that come with this program, giving herself and her siblings a lot to laugh at.  My daughter hasn't tried using the Users' Guide to learn the program -- her learning so far has been by trial-and-error.  If the authors of this program could see my daughter interacting with their program, they could see why a PDF Users' Guide tutorial isn't what's needed for this ""Debut"" program.

I am concerned that Anime Studio crashed a LOT while we've used the program on an otherwise stable Vista laptop computer.  If you install this program, I suggest monitoring the Reliability Monitor (in Vista and Windows 7) to see how reliable your computer currently is, and again how reliable it is after you've installed and begun using Anime Studio Debut.  (To find the Reliability Monitor, click the Start button, then type ""Reliability"" in the Start Search textbox to find the monitor).

SUMMARY:  I think Anime Studio Debut offers a lot of value for the money.  I've spent nearly as much money on stupid kids' games that weren't nearly so interesting to play with.  The functionality of this program is pretty deep.  Where the program comes up short is not on the functionality it has, but in how new users must go about learning how to use those functions.  For a ""Debut"" program, there is a lot that can be done to make learning Anime Studio Debut easier to do.","An arduous learning curve, it's suitable only for the highly motivated",1257984000,47.0,

There are many customizable options in the Bitdefender interface.  None of it is confusing, but there are a lot of options.  The software operates simply, though.

Tresca,"I was new to Vista when I received my new laptop, so I wasn't aware of the changing software landscape that seems to be a hallmark of Microsoft products.  Although I did get the Microsoft Office Suite, it now excludes Outlook.  This made me very, very angry.

When the opportunity to review this latest incarnation of Outlook came along, I jumped at it, because life post-Outlook is pretty awful. And, now that I'm back in the warm bosom of Microsoft's email program, I can breathe a sigh of relief.

This is the same Outlook you either love or hate.  The programs still seem to be developed independently of each other. There's also junk email scanning which is semi-useful if you don't have spam blocking on your server side. The Reading Pane is omnipresent but removable and there's this irritating tendency to group messages into, well, groups, as if the entire world thought that would be a good idea for message sorting.  News flash: It isn't. Fortunately, it can be turned off.

The calendar is the same as other Outlook calendars, only a little more graphically appealing.  You still cannot easily import data from one of the Outlook programs to the other; dragging and dropping emails preserves body and header.  Similarly, you can drag an email to your contacts, but that only drops the email name into the contacts list and dumps the entire body into Notes field.  In other words, there's no smart way to navigate content between the various sub-programs within Outlook.  This is something that's sorely needed.  The electronic signature at the bottom of emails is becoming the de facto business card, and it'd be nice if we could just import that content right into Contacts.  But alas, Outlook's not about to be THAT innovative.

The other new thing that hangs around, waiting for you to notice it, is the To-Do Bar.  As if navigating the myriad of Outlook programs who don't really like each other wasn't difficult enough, you are now expected to navigate sideways.  From a space perspective, this makes sense; there's more real estate on the horizontal axis of most monitors.  But it is counterintuitive to the rest of the Outlook design, which is top to bottom. The To-Do Bar is basically what used to happen when you clicked on your name in older versions of Outlook: it summarizes all your relevant information in one place. The problem is that it won't go away easily. It eventually goes away if you can figure out how to ask it nicely.  But apparently each application is treated like its own entity, so removing the To-Do Bar from say, email, means it still shows up when you're in Tasks.

Finally there's what's new in this version of Outlook, the Business Contact Manager.  It requires SQL server. This is most useful if you're running a business, and contains everything from projects to accounts, billable hours to marketing campaigns.  It's of particular use to freelancers and hourly consultants; as a consultant myself once, I ended up using the journal to clock my progress, but the BCM can do it better.  Being the new kid on the block, BCM is better integrated with all the other programs.

People ask me all the time what they should use, and I want to be able to really give them an answer. While this wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. It did catch spyware on a computer that had had antivirus protection beforehand! The main issue is how slow the software is. I didn't notice it really slowing the computer, but the scans were very slow.

The good:
1. Found spyware right away--now it was just a shopping toolbar, but it found it outside of a scan and gave me the option to take care of it right away.
2. The install was easy.
3. I found nothing in the menus that were confusing. The menus are set out out pretty well. If you have to do something (like click on a plus symbol for more info), it's usually said on the screen what you have to do.
4. Things were setup about like I would want them right out of the box. There is a game mode and it turns off after 4 hours by default.

The bad:
1. Took forever to install. I installed it on 3 computers: an xp dual-core, a vista dual-core, and a brand new windows 7 machine. It took over 45 minutes each time! I don't even begin to know why it took so long to install, and the bar fills up multiple times so there really is no way to judge if you can leave it for 10 minutes or 2 hours or what.
2. Full system scans take forever. If you leave your computes on overnight or whatever this may not be an issue, but they just take hours!
3. For some reason manual update is hidden away in the menus.

So overall, if you want your antivirus and antispyware package in one, I think you do get better antispyware protection with webroot. But because of how slow the scans are, I still suggest Norton Antivirus 2011 over this. If you need antispyware protection, the free version of malwarebytes or superantispyware works great if you're willing to run manual scans and their pay versions aren't expensive if you want scheduled scans.

So far out of 2011 software I've tried I rate them:
1 Star:
Bitdefender 2011--the file-sharing it does was a deal-breaker for me (beyond continued issues from previous version)
3 Stars:
This
Kaspersky 2011--catches stuff, but not well designed
AVG free--works ok, not the best at catching everything, tries to install it's annoying toolbar
4 Stars:
Norton Antivirus 2011--not perfect, but works, fast, well designed
Microsoft Security Essentials--my preference for free. I do think that it's lightweight protection, but for value it's great.","Not bad, but slow",1290384000,,

Windows 7 to me is nothing more than Vista with window dressing and many of the old bugs Vista had; however, many reviewers find it to be the best thing since sliced bread.

 Recently I've been seeing incredibly negative reviews about Quicken Essentials for Mac.  Not only that, but I don't believe Intuit has seen a positive Quicken for Mac review in the last 6 years.  Something about Macs and Quicken apparently don't mix.

 Keep in mind I already have the negative mindset just from the other reviews so I'm expecting trolls to leak from my hard drive and wreak havoc on my accounts.  Sorry, no green, hairy trolls ever appeared.

 In fact, I was shocked.  For the intended purpose, this program does what you pay it to do.  It keeps track of your accounts, bank or otherwise and downloads updates as you request.

 True, it's a little quirky, but so are most Mac programs when compared to Windows equivalents and that's part of the problem.  Essentials is for Mac not for Windows so the comparisons are unfair.

 This isn't to say it's all a bed of roses for those coming from Windows.  Converting Windows based Quicken files is difficult and here's a clue - don't bother.  It just won't work and what you'll see in the end isn't what you had in the beginning.  If you've got 25 years of financial matter then you had better consider using a virtual machine or going back to a pc.

 By this point you've figured it's easier to just download your account information from banks and brokerages but this is where Essentials does fail the Windows user.

 You first have to download the information as a Web Connect file to your desktop and then drag and drop it to a box in Quicken at which point it's loaded as an account.  Sound familiar?  If you use Quicken's online equivalent at [...] this is nearly the same procedure minus the drag and drop.  This means you'll have to open a browser, go to your bank or brokerage, open the account, download the file to the desktop, close your browser session and then drag and drop the desktop file.  Once you delete the desktop file you've just completed seven steps to create an account.

 And who thought this up?

 However, once that procedure is done you've got your accounts up and running.  Minor inconvenience compared to the original Quicken I used many years ago that required manual entries and had nothing in the way of internet connection.

 Other complaints seem to focus on the lack of online bill paying through this Quicken, a feature I never used or appreciated in the Windows version because it wasn't free.  I've just used my bank's free only bill payment feature therefore I can't comment on what I don't use.

 Yes, you could use equivalents such as Moneydance, iBank or iCash but none offer online updating - Quicken has a lock on that feature.

 In addition, you can't lose with Quicken because of the 60 day unconditional money back guarantee.  If you don't like it, return the software for a full refund.  I've used the refund procedure one time (last year when a relative gifted me a Starter edition when I wanted Deluxe) and they do honor it.  Buy Moneydance or iCash and there is no refund since they offer a free trial.

 Overall I just didn't see much to be negative about with this program.  It does what it was designed to do and does it well.  It won't please advanced users expecting minute-by-minute stock updates and flashing lights, but it does an admirable job for the intended purpose.",Not Bad for Intended Use,1274832000,,

I have to declare myself thoroughly delighted with both of them.  I knew Trend Micro from 8 or 9 years ago when I got to know it as a free online system scanner.  I used it several times to rid myself of pesky viruses that McAfee could not deal with.

The specific thing I like about the Trend Micro is that it really doesn't slow the system down at all, while providing apparently great protection (I've had no virus problems that I'm aware of).  Some antivirus programs I've used really slow the computer down and make looking at pages on the Internet a drag.  But the Trend Micro has been almost invisible.

I have been very happy with the feature whereby it clears out the malicious cookies that are downloaded onto my computer through surfing the Internet.  Each day it deletes spybots and data miners without my prompting it.

I've been using Quicken ever since it came out, and Managing Your Money before that, and MS Money for a couple of years. I was satisfied with the 2008 version. There are some improvements in the latest version, most notably the faster updating and the ability for the update to bypass the frequent requests by some banks for answers to security questions. Additionally, I noticed a correction to estimated taxes. The Tax Schedule used to include the January 15th payment in the wrong year, but now you can identify the tax year involved and the report will be correct.

There are two complaints I have and that is the Tax Planner still will not allow you to choose the next year. It is locked on 2011. The other is the tax schedule lists interest by banks, but does not subtotal each bank. Your tax return requires interest be reported by each bank. If I discover anything more I will update this review.

Update:

I moved this review from the guide book to the product itself.

One change I do not like is the way the ""overview"" presents itself now.  Previously, the individual account holdings were shown and no other stock would appear, but now the complete list of stocks you have in your portfolio list shows and you must scroll through it to find the stocks that are currently in the particular account.  I have a long list of stocks, perhaps a hundred that I have bought and sold over the years.  Most are inactive, but they show anyway.  What a mess this is.  I liked the 2008 version of the ""overview"" far better.

I noticed a small problem.  When you reconcile an account you have the option to use a statement or the online balance.  Once you have chosen ""statement"" it seems to always return to statement even if you have subsequently elected to use the online balance method.  I have tested this many times by unchecking the statement choice and even going as far as removing the statement balance, then selecting the online balance method.  The very next time you reconcile it will choose ""statement"" for you.  It is an annoying inconvenience.

One other minor issue is the sound effects.  When you first open Quicken there is a very loud gong noise that will make you wish you had left the sound system off.  The remaining sound is like an old manual cash register ringing up a sale and is tolerable.  Due to the startling nature of the opening ""gong"" I went into preferences and turned the sound off.  My overall assessment is that this product is worth the price even at retail, but you can get a very good deal if you search for it.  I pretty much use Amazon because the prices are really good and you can trust them.  No, I don't work for them or own stock, but I wish I bought a boatload when it was at 32 cents a share!

Let me describe one huge advantage of getting frequent or daily updates.  You can check your credit cards for errors well ahead of the arrival of the statement.  If your card has been stolen you can track its use.  You can inform your issuer in detail about what is yours and what is not, and you can contact the stores where the illegal purchases have been made.  In other words you can stay on top of your credit card activity.  I have used Quicken this way for years and have discovered duplicate charges, and erroneous charges by businesses within hours of the charge being made.

Update:
Do not import data from Quicken into tax software without realizing that there will be errors.  When interest for December is credited it normally gets posted in January therefore when you create a tax schedule it will include the previous year's December and not include the current December.  So, when you make the tax schedule you must do a custom search avoiding interest posted in the wrong year and capturing data for the current tax year posted in the following year.  I recommend waiting for the tax forms from your financial institutions before submitting your tax return.","Quicken Deluxe 2011, yes I own it.",1308182400,,

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: Nancy Drew is off to the City of Dreams? [Is that right?] No? Anyway, she gets to rub elbows with a Soap Opera Star in the Big Apple. Oh yeah, there is the confusion; isn't this supposed to be in Hollywood? Well, it's all about climbing the ladder of goodwill and what better way than through the entertainment industry, right?

INITIAL SCORE: 85

CHARACTERS:
Mattie Jensen: The girl of the hour. Stick with her and you'll go far, kid. Well, all she did was sit around rehearsing lines, but that is the life of an actress. I did see her one scene she had acted which wasn't bad. No, I don't think she's the culprit. Why is she dating around so frequently like that? Ick.

Mille Strathorn: That silly old bat. Loved her riddles [half have been done before in other venues]. I think she is getting a little senile, but I don't think it was enough to be considered the culprit, especially since she owns the place.

Lillian Weiss: Man, she needs to get la.... wait, this is a family show. She was just a mean girl, but her abrasiveness was so strong that I doubted she was the culprit.

William Pappas: I only heard grumblings from his office. If he don't physically appear in the game, he ain't the culprit :P

Dwayne Powers: This guy was just falling apart! [Financially, second-guessing his relationship with Mattie, etc.]  I am glad he cast me as an extra! Yaahhh!

Rick Arlen: He was a smooth talker and a couple of his one-liners made me smile, but I had him firmly in my target sight as the evil villain.

Phone-A-Friends: This has got to be the 2nd best interplay in the relationship of Nancy/Ned aside from the Captive Curse argument. They said they loved each other! That was amazing only Adventure # 2 into the series since I don't believe I have heard it since. By game # 31, is the romance getting stale? This version of Bess had an odd accent and I believe this particular game was the most helpful George has ever been.

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 87

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
The background music was a little blander than other games, but it didn't detract from the ambience. You have to forgive the cartoonish graphics from 1999.  Overall, it was fine.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 87

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: Like I mentioned before, the riddles were intriguing since it hasn't been done again in the series. There were no mini games. :(  In fact, I think HER went with plot and culprit motivations over cheaper filler material, which makes this game stand apart from the later adventures in the series. [And that got fans to trip over themselves with praise for the good old days.]

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 85

GENERAL IOTAS: A lot of little bugs involving linear plot being halted unless you were perfect with clue discovery. I think this frustrated fans and the later games featured this process less.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84

ADVENTURE ENDING: It was ridiculous in the scheme of things how bland it was. I am not necessarily complaining, but compared with other endings, this was definitely bottom 3 for HER all time.

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 82

* PART 2 *
I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me four days [7 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 81

My Strong Points: The games I was given, I mostly aced.

My Weak Points: Swung and missed on the culprit.

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 82 + 81/2 = 81.5 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: Cracks the Top Ten! Not bad considering the problems with computer programming in the late 90's. Just goes to show that story can outclass most visual and sound appeal. Perhaps HER can Remaster THIS. The poorly released Secrets Can Kill didn't really deserve the Remaster even though the nostalgia of the opening game was understood.

It seemed more stable then the previous antivirus programs I've used, so I went ahead and updated it to Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 after about two weeks of use. Worked the same for a while until I started really noticing the difference between these programs and my last antivirus program, Spyware Doctor.

When I first installed Bitdefender Antivirus 2010, it found a couple of problems that Spyware Doctor didn't. However, since then it's found almost nothing, which is strange... when I used Spyware Doctor, I would scan every night and find four or five minor problems (tracking cookies, etc) over the course of a week. This program hasn't found anything in the last two months. I finally reinstalled Spyware Doctor and came up with several minor security risks that Bitdefender ignored. My definitions are automatically updated, so that isn't the problem.

After about a month of using it, I began having strange problems. First, Bitdefender's firewall suddenly began causing problems with programs that were normally allowed to access the internet. I tried removing them from the exceptions list then re-adding them, but nothing worked. I finally gave up and disabled Bitdefender's firewall and everything worked fine again. I emailed their support, but never received a response.

Second, around the same time I began having computer lockups... my computer would stop responding and run EXTREMELY slow. At the same time, the Bitdefender icon in the taskbar would turn grey with the message telling me that Bitdefender encountered a problem and I need to restart the computer. It usually cleared itself up within a few minutes, but would reoccur randomly. Sometimes it would go several days, other times it would happen two to three times in a single evening. I finally had to shut down the real-time monitoring, which seems to have cured this problem.

Well, after shutting down the process scanning and the firewall, and not being happy with the daily system scanning, what's left? Email scanning is flaky at best (will suddenly mark a single email in the middle of an entire conversation with a friend as 'spam'), and it's extremely slow (2-3x as long to check email). I also hate the fact that every time it finds a spam message it gives you a pop-up. I haven't found a way to shut these off, but by now I've given up and have moved on.

If you are an advanced Mac user, you probably won't need this product. Go with a dedicated and strong anti-virus instead. Most of Trend Smart Surfing's features are better provided elsewhere, such as at the hardware router/firewall level, which you can configure to provide stronger protection across your entire home network. With a good router/firewall, all your networked devices are centrally protected and can be managed at a single point of entry (through the router's web admin interface), instead of having to be installed and configured one computer at a time when you go with a software protector. This product can work in tandem with a well-configured router/firewall, but if you already have website filtering rules on your router and other security features enabled, Smart Surfing becomes redundant.

Problems:
---------

There is no separate admin password for this software, so if you intend to use this to protect your kids, you may wish to think twice. The password is linked to the Mac's system password. If your kids have the password, they can turn this off. Worse still is that this software provides step-by-step instructions when it blocks a site on how to turn OFF the blocking, instead of a simple ""Access Denied"" message.

As for the malicious website blocking/phishing protection, I never encountered it being triggered, except for pop-ups from one ad network ([...]). I tried a variety of ""normal"" sites as well as some adult ones and warez serial number sites. Nothing. Modern email providers such as Yahoo and Google automatically filter out spam and other malicious emails, so I could not test the anti-phishing feature. I did not have any phishing sites to try out. Google has also been providing a phishing block for a while now.

As for virus protection, it is unclear if this product is an anti-virus/virus scanner. I believe it is not. The description is vague about this, perhaps intentionally: ""Defends against viruses, worms, Trojan horse programs, and other everyday security threats."" File scanning appears to be very slow.

Conclusion:
-----------

For casual users, this product is probably ok, but there is no substitute for safe web usage habits and awareness of personal data security. It does not take a lot to be informed about how to stay safe, and there is no better remedy than knowledge. Know what phishing scams, spoof emails, and malicious attachments/links look like. When in doubt, do not click any links or attachments in emails or IM's, even if they are from people you know. Usernames and emails can be easily compromised or spoofed. If you have children, lock them down at the router level and set up filtering rules there.

For power users and technically advanced Mac owners, skip this product. I do not notice any difference after having installed this and trying out for 3 days. The product is only 50 MB installed, so uninstalling won't take long.",Product is of dubious benefit to advanced users,1245974400,3.0,

However - for Vermont, where there is a property tax ""prebate"" that residents must know to apply for...TaxCut does not have the forms one needs AND they do not tell you you need the forms.  SO - I would never  get the $550 ""prebate"" that I was entitled to this year, except that I knew about it from previous tax filings.
Also, it bothers me that in order to get my ""prebate"" I had to fill out downloaded forms by hand after searching for needed information in my files and using a calculator to get some needed totals.  To me, this is NOT what I should have to do after spending over $65 for a Fed./State/e-filing program!!!
Besides, if Turbo Tax can fill out these forms automatically and have these same forms in its State of Vermont Tax Program - what is wrong with TaxCut doing the same thing???  (I chatted online with TaxCut's customer support about this problem and they told me (a week ago) that there would be no updates to their Vermont program and that they ""do not include all needed forms"" in their program.)

PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.

Pros:

Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.

Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)

The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.

Cons:

The reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 (the first time I've done that with this series) is because there are several places where what you have to do to move on is illogical, and for these same areas, there isn't any hints to let you know what to do.  As a result, I wound up having to consult ""UHS Hints"" (a really good website where you can find hints to all the Nancy Drew games) a lot more than I would have liked...

""Shadow Ranch"" is situated in the Arizona Desert - and the graphics of this area are great!  The mystery surrounds strange happenings that are occuring on the ranch - such as a phantom horse riding through at night, always accompanied by a major mishap at the ranch (a snake bite, power lines become downed, pump house floods).

Nancy finds out early in the game that there are rumors about an old bank robber who had hidden a treasure for his sweetheart - who used to live at the ranch.  So your job, as Nancy Drew, teen detective, is to 1. find out who or what is behind all of the strange mishaps - are they linked to the phantom horse, or does it just appear that way?  And 2. find the treasure - if there is one...

In order to get around the desert, you get to ride a horse - be sure to look around at everything you can find about riding horses before you begin, or you just might find yourself falling off a lot!!!

Overall, I found this game to be fun to play, although it did become quite frustrating at times...  If you find yourself having difficulty as I did, I'd recommend going to the ""UHS hints"" website - they allow you to choose how many hints to take, and you can always get a few before you're given the full answer - this way, if you just need a push in the right direction, you don't have to see the full answer and ruin the fun of figuring out for yourself.",Another Good Game!,1134864000,13.0,

Fortunately, the customer service rep was able to figure out the problem and I was able to finish the install. It works as advertised. I have been using Quicken for over 15 years and find it very reliable. Most problems I have had have to do more with operating system errors. I am using windows 10 and Quicken 2016t works well.",A rough start but now works well.,1453248000,,

The second installation the computer entered chkdsk and replaced alot of files.  At the desktop the product wanted to reinstall itself.  I declined.  I have had computers for 25 years now, never had software act so alien to a computer.  I purchased it from Bestbuy, they declined a refund because the package was open.

I was inside a Big Box Electronics store looking to buy a piece of software when the Geek Guy said to me, Don't waste you money, use what we do..... CCleaner.  He said download it for free!  I did and sure a heck it worked!  Took care of my issues.

Since that day I learned the free issue as good as it may be can even be better with the Full version. (Paid version). Note: If you have more than 3 PCs/Laptops, then look for the Unlimited License version. Sold here on Amazon too.  I only have two laptops and one PC and this was on sale at that time.  Just thought I help you out if you need more than 3 License.

What this does is schedule runs, auto updates itself, and more.  I captured screens of the process in motion today for you.  The last screen shot has a few highlighted arrows in red so you can see what is available in the paid version.

Hope this helps you decide.  It is Highly Recommended!","Works Great!  Auto updates in background, set it and forget it.  You will love it!
