12029,12029,5.0,False,"05 2, 2016",ACHTDPEQYSEQL,B01CS8RSIS,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},mhnstr,"Cyberlink PowerDVD 16 Ultra is a media player that supports not only Blu-ray playback, but also 3D Blu-ray playback as well as being capable of playing a host of different audio and video formats.  While there are other players such as VLC which are more affordable (free!), there are Blu-ray discs that VLC can not play.  For example, I could not play Spectre using VLC, but PowerDVD played the disc without hesitation.

Setup
Cyberlink learned from the complaints about version 14 and now you are asked if you would like to associate video, music or images with PowerDVD.  A choice of extension for each media type like how VLC does it would have been nice, but at least you can choose what types of files you want to associate with the program.

Upon start, the program begins scanning your computer for images, music and videos.  To stop the program from snooping through your files in each of media files, you need to under settings / preferences / media library and there you can select the folders that PowerDVD will scan.  To stop the scan, simply remove the folders from the library.  I can understand why the authors would set the program to scan common directories without first asking, but I wish that there was a better way to stop the scanning if you didn't want it to happen.

PC vs TV
One of the first screens that pops up when you start the program is a screen that gives you a choice between PC mode and TV mode.  Both have the same functionality, but the two modes present the menus differently.  PC mode is the classic interface with lots of options and menus.  The TV mode has much simpler menus to reduce screen clutter to make it easier to navigate.  The interface in both cases is smooth and easy to navigate.

Library
The media library is a very nice feature.  The user interface looks clean and handles smoothly.  There are also options to customize the interface.

The photo viewer handled different file types and perusing through images files is much smoother and faster than with the Windows Photo Viewer, for example.  Having all of the video files in one place is very convenient.

There is the option to use YouTube and Vimeo files within the library as well which is a nice feature.

Media Support
The ultra version of PowerDVD 16 is the only one of the three versions that includes Blu-ray 3D Disc support.

Casting
A nice feature is media-casting support which allows you to stream audio and video to Apple TV, Roku, and Chromecast devices on your network.  However, for this to work you must have one of these devices and it doesnt work with Blu-ray discs.

Performance
I played mkv, m4v and avi files with both PowerDVD and the free VLC player.  Both handled the different files types competently.  The video enhancement features of PowerDVD were set to sharpen detail, enhance lighting and optimize color (50%) and to enhance audio (50%).  I didn't seem much of a difference when playing both players side by side on my computer (see the image that I have uploaded of the comparison).

I found the playback of Blu-ray discs to be very nice but not spectacular.  However, for discs like Spectre neither the VLC player nor Blu-ray player that came with Nero 12 could decode the disc whereas PowerDVD did it with ease.

Power DVD allows you to change the enhancement features and to play side to side versions of the same image so that you can see the effect which is a very nice feature so that you can tweak the enhancements to get them just as you want them.

Overall
Is it worth investing in PowerDVD if other programs such as VLC handles videos or Windows Photo Viewer allows you to scroll through photos?  The interface of PowerDVD is much slicker than the other programs and PowerDVD can handle a lot of different files types.  What makes PowerDVD better is the support of Blu-ray discs, especially 3D discs and the video and audio enhancements that the program offers.  Plus you don't have to worry about tweaking the program to make it play certain discs.  PowerDVD handles them all.  So if you are looking for a media center to handle all of your media, then PowerDVD 16 Ultra is a very good choice.",A media center with a smooth interface that handles almost all types of media and media files.,1462147200,2,

Its main problem is that Windows XP is also a superb operating system, and most users will have difficulty understanding why we needed more than an incremental upgrade from XP. To the extent that the Vista interface deviates from the XP menus, I mostly have found this to be simply irritating.

The main flaw with Vista is that it deliberately did not have backwards compatibility with many earlier-version Window drivers.  Some printers and other devices flat out would not work with Vista.  This was an outrageous decision by Microsoft and it ultimately doomed the operating system with many users and businesses as word of this incompatibility got around.  Windows 7 essentially corrected this fatal mistake years later.

That having been said, Vista with SP1 is very solid and reliable. In my experience on my Notebook computer, however, be advised that it runs a LOT faster and better with plenty of DRAM. It seems to need more DRAM to run well. My new Intel dual-core Notebook came with 1GB DRAM, which was usually enough in Windows XP (except for most imaging software, which needed at least 2GB). However, I splurged and upgraded the computer to 4GB DRAM, and the difference was literally night-and-day. Vista could get doggy with 1GB. With 4 GB DRAM it literally screams on my Intel dual-core machine.

One unforgivable lapse on the part of Microsoft with Vista Home Premium is that it does not include Fax support. In this day and age, this is truly astounding. This represents a very obnoxious decision by someone.

The Vista interface is prettier. What more can I say?

One thing I think that Microsoft needs to watch is the security options. Security features are all well and good, but at the end of the day the beauty of a microcomputer is that it frees most of us, most of the time, from dependence on the IT crew in the white labcoats. XP and Vista have so many security protocols that in some instances it is rekindling this dependence.

Overall, I am satisfied with Vista, and I would not hesitate again to buy a computer that came pre-loaded with it. The upgrade learning curve from XP is really not all that great.",Flawed due to poor driver backwards compatible.,1217808000,,

 They delivered tremendous value for the money even though they were often unstable.

 MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2016 isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. The Plus version for a few dollars more is a better selection.

 Stability on an Intel i7 box running Windows 10 was okay: I had no crashes, though I didn't work the program really hard.

 If you've used other video editing programs, there really isn't a learning curve. If you'r enew to video editing, download the manual from the Magix site and the trial version and grant yourself the time to work through it. Don't assume that you'll instantly be a competent video editor.

I used a freeware FastStone Capture, it does a lot of of image captures, editing and adding annotation text.

There are multiple ways you can do in capturing contents. The software also give you an option to save as personal profiles for different combination of capturing configuration, so you don't have to repeat those mouse clicks that you use the most. Sort of a mini macro.

Capturing images also give you a built in editor.

Even with minor tweaks, Office 2010 offers essentially the same user experience as Office 2007.

Installation of Office 2010 on a desktop computer(4 GB RAM, 3GHZ Intel dual core processor) running Windows 7 Professional (and with an existing Office 2003 Professional version already installed) took about 20 minutes. Installation was trouble-free. Although the document history entries in the Windows start menu were erased after the install, the recent documents history were available within each of the Office applications. I don't use Outlook for email at home, but do use it for calendaring. All of my existing calendar entries and display/printing preferences were preserved and displayed immediately in Outlook; it also recognized my preference to start Outlook in the calendar view).

While the interface is familiar, application launch time is slightly faster, and there is improved feedback to users on recent files accessed in a navigation pane that appears under the File tab.

So, with a familiar interface, a problem-free install and apparent improvements in navigation and responsiveness...why 2 stars? Because the Office Professional suite is very expensive. The only reason I'm doing this review is because I had access to a deeply discounted purchase price via an educational licensing agreement.  But if you are currently running an earlier version of Office, I can't offer a single compelling reason to sink anywhere from 220 dollars (for a product key to activate the trial versions on new PCs) to more than 400 dollars (for a version delivered on DVD) for the consumer retail pricing. This suite is overpriced no matter how you slice it, and the lack of an upgrade price and package --which Microsoft touts as ""simplified""-- makes it more so.

If you have very basic productivity suite needs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) you can consider the stripped down&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/student-version/dp/B00337D8U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""student version""</a>&nbsp;instead for much less...if your needs don't include Outlook, Access or Publisher. Alternatively, if you have an affiliation with an educational institution that has an academic licensing arrangement, you should have a access to a very reasonably priced Professional version. Many businesses also have arrangements for ""use at home"" versions at deep discounts. Consider this also.

Otherwise, unless you're just a ""current version junkie"" who enjoys having the latest and greatest version of every application, I can't offer a good case for spending this much on a set of tools that looks, feels and performs almost exactly like its predecessor.","Nothing new here: familiar interface, steep price",1308355200,2,

3455,3455,4.0,False,"09 24, 2009",A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE,B001AFFRM0,,Ravenskya,"Where to even begin - First my major frustration.

I have drooled over this software for years and when it finally arrived I tore open the box to install right away.  The box is nice, the included booklet and materials are also nice, well made and useful.  The installation went well, no trouble at all, until after completing the install from the disc and moving on to the update from their website.  The update downloaded and started to install - then froze.  Confused I discovered that Windows had ignored my telling it not to automatically download Windows updates and had instead downloaded one and was attempting to reboot my computer in the middle of my Rosetta Stone install. I sat for over an hour telling Windows not to reboot the computer while waiting for the Rosetta Stone update to complete.  Finally I had to go make dinner and left the computer to its own devices.

When I returned my laptop was dead - completely... so I called Dell and they did some magic to tell me that my hard drive was kaput.  I now had to wait 3 days for my new hard drive to arrive (thank goodness for Dell's Warranties).  Once I had the new hard drive and had put my computer back together, I tried the Rosetta Stone install again.  This time it went much faster, and the update went off without a hitch.  Then I read in the agreement that the software can only be installed a total of 2 times.  So I called Rosetta Stone - The told me that it was indeed true, that heaven forbid I buy a new computer, I cannot move it to the new one without contacting them ahead of time to deactivate the registration on the old computer.  I was upset because I had wanted to also install it on my children's computer so that they could try it as well - but I was informed that unless I mailed them proof of purchase and leapt through a few other hoops, that they could do nothing for me.  If my current hard drive dies - I am out $500 software.  That fact alone would make me as a consumer very hesitant to shell out the kind of money they are asking for.

Now on to the product -

I like it.  I set up 3 students on it; me, my son, and my husband and only myself and my son have tried it.  He loved it but could not do the speaking recognition since not only has he picked up a strong southern (read ""redneck"") accent - but he's also 8 years old and it had a hard time recognizing anything he said.

What I like:
1) There really isn't any English in the program, you start it up and boom - there's a picture of a little girl with the word in German above it and a lady saying the word out loud.  There is a lot of clicking to identify what is being said to you, picking out the picture that matches the words or repeating what has been said to you.
2) The pictures are very pretty; the flow of the material is presented in a very attractive manner.
3) This is incredibly easy to use; my 8 year old went along for a while using it and having a blast with no trouble or instruction at all until he hit the speaking part.
4) Others have complained of the headset - this is the only one I have ever had for the computer and it hasn't given me any trouble at all.  It even survived a road trip with quite a bit of abuse.
5) This method of teaching me the masculinity/femininity of the articles and different words actually seems to be sticking.  Which is funny because I've taken (and failed) German classes and had a hard time remembering them before.

What I didn't like:
1) The biggest one is the issue with only installing it twice - ever.
2) The speech recognition was going great for a while, but then would suddenly not understand me in a simple syllable.  I spent 3 minutes trying to pronounce ""com"" the way it wanted, ending with a string of curses and lots of beeping in my ear - perhaps I have a southern accent as well.
3) I would really have liked for the pictures to have gone with the culture of the country whose language I am trying to learn.  Why am I learning the German word for Woman while looking at a picture of a Chinese Kabuki Dancer?  I understand the multicultural aspect and that they probably just have stock pictures used for all of the languages - but for the money they want for this product, put pictures from German speaking cultures in it.  When I buy the Mandarin version THEN give me the Kabuki pictures.
4) I personally don't believe that I will be fluent in the language through this method without finding a German in real life to converse with.  I am currently almost done with phase 1 and although I now recognize the words, I don't know that I will be able to formulate conversation through this method.  I will update when I complete the entire program.

It is my belief that this software will allow you to probably pass German 1 and 2 at a college level with at least a ""B.""  I also think that you could go over to Germany, be able to order a meal, ask for directions and get around with little to no problem.  I DON'T think that you will be able to discuss politics or pass as a native.

Is it worth the money?  If you take out the install limitation - the software itself is great.  I do recommend it, but you have to know ahead of time how badly do you want to learn the language and how much are you willing to pay to learn it.  The cost is about the same as a college class and would cover both German 1 and 2 at the college level so in theory it's cheaper then taking the two classes in it.  If you have a hard time in classes then this may be the way to go.",Great product with shoddy licensing regulations,1253750400,3,

The tipping point was to be told in October 2012 by Intuit not only that there is still no full upgrade to Quicken for Mac 2007, but also that as I'm not a US resident Intuit would not even provide me with the Mac OS X 10.7 Lion-compatible version of Quicken for Mac 2007 from the PowerPC version (16.0.2.- R3) I had been using!

I was a long-term user of Quicken, with 14 years of financial data recorded in it from June 1998 to October 2012.  I had been using both Macs and PCs (Macs preferred) since 1984. I migrated my financial data to Quicken in 1998 from an earlier Mac personal accounting application called Dollars & $ense, from a company called Monogram which went out of business about the same time their product succumbed to the Y2K bug.

Intuit long has had a popular and evidently well-supported financial software range for Windows, but its product development and support for the Mac platform went into terminal decline after 2007. Its support and customer service for Mac users now have degraded to a point of non-existence or uselessness. What totally impenetrable thinking led Intuit to this incredible outcome?  The answer is a mystery. Would Microsoft throw away its market advantage by failing to maintain cross-platform compatibility between Mac and Windows versions of MS Office, or Adobe its cross-platform compatible market dominance in imagery and PDF processing? No way!

When the initially excellent Quicken for Mac 2007 started showing its age, Intuit engaged in some two years of beta-testing and consultation with the Mac-user community.  This was among the largest scale, most hyped beta-testing and consumer consultations ever for any Mac product. It turned out that the long promised, much hyped Quicken Mac upgrade was nothing but vaporware. The only result was a dumbed-down standalone product, so-called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], the exact opposite of everything that the Mac-user community told Intuit we need!  Is it any wonder that we Mac users feel that Intuit has treated us with contempt?

Intuit's failure to build on its market potential with Mac users is a tragedy and farce. I highly recommended Quicken for Mac 2007 in earlier times when it was justly the market leader. Now, sadly, I must strongly recommend that Mac users avoid the product and its makers.

More than seven years now have passed since this last release of Quicken for Mac, in August 2006. Intuit never updated this out-of-date product -- merely patched it two or three times when its bugs and incompatibilities stopped it working in new versions of Mac OS X. Since 2010 Intuit has not even updated its only other personal finance software for Mac, the absurdly named&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], a downgrade of Quicken for Mac which has even fewer essential features than its obsolete predecessor.

What on earth has been going on at Intuit that it has abandoned Mac product development? My best guess is that some totally unrealistic and irrational feedback, typically from a small number of noisy Mac personal finance users, has convinced Intuit that we Mac users are just creative types and airheads with no grasp of the mathematical logic, rational thinking and work discipline required to use full-featured personal financial accounting.

The unreasonableness of some customer negative feedback on personal finance software would be enough to alienate the most helpful software developers. Typically, the noisiest unreasonableless ranges across complaints about non-core, third party functions like bank downloads; blaming software for user error, or the consequences of user failure to read user manuals or to follow simple universal accounting principles. Has this unreasonableness convinced not only Intuit, but also other personal finance software makers, that we Mac users are financial and computer illiterates not worth their time and trouble? Could the impossible-to-satisfy high maintenance demands of financially illiterate customers also explain why even Microsoft never released its former personal finance product, Microsoft Money, for Mac -- and discontinued it for Windows in 2009?

I have almost 16 years of continuous, detailed, accurate data in iBank. This is the best move I ever made in personal finance recordkeeping -- but the most unrealistic, unreasonable and absurd remarks I ever have seen about personal finance software continue to flow in attacks on iBank. Among the most absurd claims is that either of the two outdated Quicken personal finance products is as good as, or better than, the state-of-the-art iBank software, which has had more feature-rich updates in the past year than both Quicken Mac products in their combined lifetimes. This is not a matter of opinion or taste: it is objective fact about all the long list of capabilities iBank has, which are lacked by the Quicken Mac deficient duo.

In these days of widespread fake review writing, star ratings averaged from total positive or negative reviews in Amazon are less trustworthy than ever for product evaluation.

- Editing Masks
- Graphic overlays
- Color correction & brightness
- White balance & tone adjustments (very useful for indoor photography)
- Video rotation
- Ability to add flash animations to your video
- Chroma key functions
- Surround sound mixing
- Stretching audio duration

From my tests and reading of the manual these functions seem to be relatively easy to use.  However, the quality of the program is always found in the production process and the final output.

To test VideoStudio Pro X2 I imported a 30 minute avi file and had VideoStudio segment this clip into segments.  Next, I placed these segments onto the storyboard and cut out a few unwanted clips at the start and end of video.  Next, I trimmed the opening and ending clips using the clip trim handles.  Finally, I applied an audio fade at the end of the video and burned the production to a dvd.  All of these functions worked perfectly and quickly on a Pentium 4, 3ghz machine with 3 gigabytes of ram.  Impressive!

However, VideoStudio does exhibit some unstable behavior upon exiting the program. VideoStudio has given me a couple error messages upon shutdown.  Strangely, neither of these error messages affected the editing and production process.  My guess is that VideoStudio is not fully releasing the memory it was occupying.

Corel is close to having a class defining video editor.  Hopefully, Corel will issue an update to fix some of the small but irritating bugs.

P.S. If you are looking for a slightly less powerful video editor that is even easier to use you might want to check out Serif's MoviePlus X3.  Both of these programs appear to be far more stable than my old Pinnacle Studio versions 8, 9 or 11.",Productive Program with a few bugs,1225584000,123,

Previously I used Kaspersky Security Suite and I didn't like it mostly because of the annoying firewall. As an antivirus I was always happy with it.

This package includes only the antivirus and is pretty solid. It installs without problems and it works. If you are worried about having on the CD an earlier version (build) that might have installation issues, you can always download the latest from Kaspersky and activate it with the serial number provided.

Kaspersky is a well-known name in the security software community and it always has one of the top places when somebody does a test on multiple security suites or antivirus programs.

The load on the system is not slowing it down, at least not on my machine, but maybe on older computers it could be a problem.

The only issue I have with this software is again the Kaspersky firewall. Since the firewall is not part of this package it is indirectly affecting it. Like most users, I would like to have a security suite rather than individual products made by different software vendors. In this case, I cannot have the anti-virus without having the Kaspersky firewall, therefore, no matter how good the antivirus I will not use that in combination with say Norton Firewall. This makes this product of limited value for me and I will probably not buy it by itself. The only use I can see for this as a standalone antivirus is on a test machine when you want to scan your suspect files with different antivirus programs.",Solid product but ....,1245801600,,

Setup was fairly easy and it was running in 15 minutes. The interface is the first thing I noticed, and the main reason I won't be switching over to Sage from Quickbooks.  It is clunky and looks dated, and reminds me of old versions of Microsoft Access. There is a large focus on text based links, and there are tabs and screens all over the place. I initially liked the left-justified menu, but opening up additional menus brings up a lot of columnar cells and tables that are not nearly as streamlined or elegant as Quickbooks.

8863,8863,4.0,False,"04 7, 2014",ACHTDPEQYSEQL,B00GDF83SM,,mhnstr,"Why file compression?  The basic idea is to decrease the space needed to store data so that you can add more data to your backup device.  Also, file compression decreases the time required to transfer the data and allows you to email more data if your email service limits the size of attachments.

WinZip has been around since 1991, but it is not the only compression utility available.  Other popular compression utilities include 7-Zip, WinRAR and MagicRAR.  All of the  compression utilities can handle ZIP, the most commonly-used compression format, along with a number of other popular formats such as 7z, RAR, TAR, and GZIP.  WinZip does not compress into CAB, RAR, TAR, 7Z, or LHA/LZH.

Performance
The speed with which WinZip 18 compresses files depends on your processor.  Toms Hardware benchmarked several different compression programs using different processors and found that the choice of processor could half the time required for compression.  You can speed up the compression even further by choosing the OpenCL under preferences.  WinZip 18 claims to be the fastest version yet, but I haven't noticed great increases in speed as compared to WinZip 17 on my Core i7 machine.

File Formats
WinZip 18 can compress into six file formats including: Zip, BZ2, ZipX, PPMD, LZMA and WavPack. WinZip can not compress into CAB, RAR, TAR, 7Z, or LHA/LZH.  However, it can extract files from 13 formats including ZIP, CAB, RAR, GZ, ISO, TAR, TGZ, IMG, ZipX, BZ2, PPMD, 7Z and LZMA. This is very useful if you share compressed data with people who use other compression formats.

Zip to the Cloud
WinZip works not just with local files but also with data stored o the most popular cloud sites.  WinZip 18 supports Box, CloudMe, Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive and the newly added SugarSync as well as ZipSend, WinZips sharing service.  WinZip 18 can retrieve files from the cloud or send data to the cloud in compressed form saving space and the time to log into your account.

Installation
I downloaded the latest version from the internet with the intention of then entering my license code from the product box I received.  During installation, I was asked if I wanted to add a toolbar to my browser and to improve WinZip by sending WinZip your usage data and the default option is to send the data.  I didn't want to do either and WinZip never bothered me about these things again.  So be careful when you install the product that you don't get third-party tools that you don't want or need.  Especially since I have gone back to find out more about the program to make WinZip better and I can find the settings turn this on or off.

Once WinZip was installed, I needed to enter my license code and then validate it online.  Here is where I had trouble because I kept getting errors.  I Googled the error and it turns out this is a common installation problem in Windows 7 64 bit.  It turns out that The Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista operating systems have security rules and User Account Control settings that restrict writing data to certain protected files and folders.  So, Windows was preventing the validation.  I tried following the workaround offered on the WinZip website which required me to delete a folder from my computer, but this turned out to be useless.  However, I could complete the installation by simply right clicking on the icon WinZip put on my desktop and running the program as an administrator.  Note that this method will not work if you don't have administrative rights on your computer.

Express Add Ons
One of the new features of WinZip 18 is the ability to add Express Add Ons.  These are programs for Windows Explorer, for Photos, for Outlook and for Sharepoint.  However, be aware that with the exception of the Add On for Windows Explorer, you have to pay an additional fee for the Add Ons.

The Add ON for Windows Explorer is free with the WinZip 18 license.  The Add On provides fast access to the key features in WinZip: compression, encryption, file conversion and watermarking, sharing via social media or email and uploading to a cloud service. All these options are present in a single window and achieving the task involves just a few clicks.  The benefit is that you don't have to launch the main WinZip program when using the Add On.

Summary
Overall, WinZip is a very good file compression utility with a lot of features that allow you to do more with the files you compress.  The ability to upload and to view files on the Cloud through the program are nice features.  I found the default options for adding AVG and performance enhancers to be annoying during installation, but since then there have been no other annoyances.",Very good compression software.

My only complaint is that Smart Photo Fix applies the ""suggested fixes"" before I can make adjustments.  Because of this I have to undo the ""suggested fixes"" and then apply my fixes.

Smart Photo fix works very well in dark environments but it does not work well in bright climates.  Everything is way overexposed!  The technology appears to have been developed in Russia where the sunlight exposure is much lower than the southern U.S.

This same overexposure problem affects ""One Step Photo Fix"".  Corel would be well advised to return to the ""One Step Photo Fix"" from version 9.  My clients were absolutely amazed by the one step photo fix in version 9.

Jaguar has a cleaner, faster interface to work in. Start-up is much faster. It's a more stable system than OS X (which is saying something, because OS X was already the most stable Mac OS).
The Mail client is also improved immensely over the previous version.
Jaguar includes iChat (instant messaging software), Mail, Address Book, and downloads are available for iSync (basically allows you to port your info from home to work and back seamlessly), iCal (scheduling software), and the new Safari web browser.

The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.
Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.
Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.
Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with ""Clear Type"" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.
PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.
This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.
Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great. Compatibility goes back to Publisher 2000, which is a draw back for users who might be using Publisher 98 or under.

It lets you put together good looking, functional video and slide presentations with basic transitions and music. Adding music is extremely easy, just import the file.
Then it uploads those to social networking sites if you want it to. Be patient when you first do this, it takes these sites sometimes 5 minutes or so before your media is available. That's true no matter what software you do or don't use. I like that this software also lets you convert between popular file types.

It is extremely intuitive and I think most users will be able to use it with very little 'figure it out time.'

There are added benefits by purchasing Office 365 Home Premium;however, you are renting so if you decided not to renew you no longer own the rights to having Office 2013.  I had already purchased Office 365 Home Premium prior to the copy I received in the prime program.

The benefit of the subscription is you are allowed to have Office 2013 installed on 5 computers.  It is important to note that you will need to use the Microsoft account you used to register the software to install the software on the 5 computers.  There is no option to send other household members a link to install the software.  You do not need to stay logged once the software is installed.  It is also important to note that you will need Windows 7 or 8 to install Office 2013.

If you are already using Office 2010 I do not see any major improvement to move to Office 365. Office 2013 is very similar to Office 2010 but integrated with the cloud.

Here some of the biggest issues I have with Office 365 Home Premium.  I reached out to Microsoft support to verify my findings. I kept the complete chat log.

All these so called benefits / add-ons are only good for the person who signed up for Office 365 Home Premium.

20GB Skydrive, Skype Account, Office on Demand only apply one account.  There is no option to create a sub-account for household members. Your only option would be to share your account and password information. While I have no issue providing my spouse my information but I will not provide my credentials to my account.  You can sign them up a regular Microsoft account, so that gets a 5GB skydrive, Office Web Apps that integrates with Office 2013

That being said as the primary account holder you do get a good value. Microsoft recently added the Office App for Android and IOS.

I had a skydrive when they offered 25GB, so I now 45GB of cloud storage that I can sync between by laptop and desktop with a Skydrive install.

I rarely used Skype in the past and that will most likely continue even with the included minutes.  I still have not used the Office on Demand, so I cannot provide an opinion

You have to decide if Office 365 Home premium.  If there was more flexibility with household accounts I would rate a minimum of 4 stars.  If you are XP and Vista user you should not purchase this product.

If you work at a company that has an active Microsoft Enterprise Agreement you should check with the EA Administrator because you may have access to the Home Use Program which allows you to purchase Office 2013 for $10

Office was a victim of its own success. Office 2003 is superb, it does everything I need it to do and more, and it does it well.

From a protection standpoint, the software is pretty good, but by no means a panacea, and things do slip through.  Personally, I suspect there are some memory leaks somewhere in the software, as my machine is unresponsive to the point of being unusable after a full system scan.

I went to an AV suite after running without one for years, but finally got hit with a virus that required reflashing and a ground-up rebuild.  Given the performance problems running AV software, however, my current thinking is that I might be better off simply taking a conservative approach with data security and redoing the build once a month.

As a user of Paint Shop Pro since version 4.14 in the 1990s, I have long endorsed PSP as a great, alternative program to Photoshop for graphic artists on a budget. As of this version, I can no longer endorse this product.

Words cannot express how much I hate Paint Shop Pro X4. As I stare into the screen with multiple confusing tabs and screen-hogging image indexes, please know that only one thing remains certain: that I hate PSPX4 with every tired muscle in my graphic artist body. Until X3, the changes they made were minimal, and contributed to more and advanced features.

However, Corel has now ruined it by trying to simplify it for amateur photographers when they should be developing it for professional artists. It's impossible to tell if this is meant for photographers, graphic artists, scrapbookers or for coloring books. It's like all these multi-function ""smart"" devices-- they do a lot of things, but they don't do anything really well, and you have to become an expert on the device to get anything out of it. PSPX4 tries to be all things to all people and fails miserably.

Corel is also trying to pull one over by claiming to have new features that have been available in the program for years. Moving a feature around and calling attention to it does not make it new--it makes the company irritating, as well as making the program difficult to for long time users to find, and difficult for new users to learn in the first place. What was once a contender to compete against the mighty Photoshop is now a glorified app for removing red eye and endless tabs and indexes. X4 is finally showing the strain of executive meddling and has jumped the shark. I have spent more hours than I care to count trying to make X4 functional and have only emerged frustrated beyond all reason.

I would advise others to stick with X3 as well as earlier versions. If you must try this program, download the demo before making a financial commitment. Better yet, I would recommend users invest their time, money and effort in Photoshop, since Corel shows no interest in making a better graphics program and only wants to make a buck from an uninformed amateur photography base.

I will not stop using Photoshop until Corel comes to its senses and stops trying to overtake the plumbing. As it is, with PSPX4 it's too easy to stop up the drain. I have never given any version of PSP a bad review, which makes me hate PSPX4 that much more. PSPX4 is ultimately penny wise and pound foolish, but mostly I won't use it because I hate it so very, very much.

I find XP easier to navigate, but perhaps it`s because I`ve had years of experience with XP and have only recently been introduced to Vista.  I am sure I will get more comfortable with Vista in time.

Vista does run very smoothly and I love the desktop sidebar, to which we can add numerous little gadgets, like a clock, calendar, weather reports.  So handy.  I wonder why they didn't think of that earlier.  I had been desperately searching for such features for my XP before running into it on Vista.

My only complaint about it is the compatibility issues I'm having with a few things.  I am sure that eventually, this will cease to be a problem.  I cannot install my Palm desktop to sync my Palm T/X.  I cannot use my American Greetings subscription to print out cards.  I cannot install the XACTI camcorder software.  It's frustrating, because it seems like everything can run on XP.

Not everyone wants or needs to use parental controls, but I happen to like them.  I finally have controls not just on browsing, but on the whole computer experience, down to how much time is allowed on the computer, what age rated games may be played, which websites can be visited.

Overall, Windows Vista is easy to use and has some terrific new features, like parental controls and the sidebar, but some compatibility issues still need to be worked out.  The Movie Maker has potential; but I just can't use it easily, because it doesn't support mp4 files.  I recommend waiting, if you are buying Vista as an upgrade.

I decided to try this software, as I wanted to get out of the dark ages and get on board with the latest technology. So far, I do not believe I have accomplished either very well. While I did not experience any major problems with installation that many people have, neither have I used many of the features that this software has available. So, for the average person just needing a family tree, I think this software works just fine. In fact, I would say that if you do not need any special features, you might just be better off looking for a less complex, less expensive piece of software. Since I have not used this program to interface with Ancestry.com, I am not qualified to review that portion of the software. Just to let you know, my PC is still running on Windows XP, so that is the operating system that it was intstalled on.

While no product is perfect, I personally think TT is pretty consistently a good piece of software at a reasonable price.  Intuit (like many other companies) plays games with licensing and features and versions, which annoy me as much as anyone else, but that doesn't make the product terrible.  BTW, if you have a tax situation that is more complex than you can handle, tax software isn't going to help you figure things out.  You'll either need to educate yourself (books & IRS website), or find a tax accountant.

As I do every year, I'll try to write a balanced review based on my own experience.  Note that I've been a user of tax software for many years, and have in the past used the competition's products as well.

Initial Review 6 Dec 2015

This is my first report, which I will update down the road after I've made more progress.

Initial download from Amazon and installation was completely trouble-free (Windows 7 64-bit).  No problems with warnings, glitches, updates, or anything else.  The only oddity (minor) was that after the initial updates it failed to automatically start the program, after saying it would.  When I did start it up, it quickly found the various copies of my 2014 tax files (I save versions as I go, in case I make a serious error and need to roll back).  Imports from the file I selected were clean and trouble-free.  My tax situation this year includes self-employment income, investment income, foreign income (not just mutual funds), itemized deductions, college expenses, 529 fund payouts, and Roth conversions.

The interview hasn't changed much that I noticed.  I switched back and forth between the interview and the forms view, as I often do, to understand what was going on under the covers.  It didn't take too long for me to enter all my current numbers (many of them estimates, of course) and get a sense of my full tax picture.  For state taxes, TT had already started on my state return (based on my home state), but asked me to confirm that it was the free state I wanted to use (extra states have additional cost, e.g., if you live and work in different states).  The state tax return was also trouble-free and looked correct.

Two glitches to report so far, hopefully these will be corrected.  Both are related to college costs, and both can cost you real money.
(1) My son's college charges a required fee that it doesn't include in the 1098T.  It's a qualified expense for the 529 fund, and there's a place for it on the form, but TT doesn't ask for it or allow it during the interview.  You sort of have to know the mechanics and go into the right form to add this item.  Not user-friendly, and can lead to higher taxes than you owe.  Bad.
(2) The ""optimization"" of the various education credits is terrible, and can lead to bad results if you let the program do what it chooses.  In my case TT reserved a huge part of the 529 funds withdrawn for the AOC (don't worry if you don't know what that is), which led to some of it becoming taxable.  There was no optimization -- I was able to do much better with simple trial-and-error.  Bad.

One other thing I noticed:  there doesn't appear to be a simple way to find and correct the health insurance figure (in the business income section).  It's hard to find in the interview, and I couldn't find a way to change it in the forms (ran into a circular reference between two forms each saying go change the other one).  This part of the program hasn't changed from last year.  Not a big problem, just something to be aware of.

Overall, I'm satisfied.  Still a reasonable program for the money, still does a decent job at reducing my tax computation and filing hassles.

Update 22 Feb 2016:

Overall I'm still reasonably happy with TT.  Some specific comments:

(1) The college fees issue I mentioned above is still in the software, which I think means that it will ""never"" be corrected.  It's important to enter this data correctly, obviously.  Further, it might affect your state tax as well: in MA, it matters in the computation of the college tuition deduction.

(2) The optimization of the American Opportunity Credit is now corrected, it works the way it should.

(3) I had a problem with the MA tuition deduction calculation works -- in my first run in December this wasn't done correctly by TT, so it over-indicated (by more than $2000) how much I would gain from this.  So now I find that I'm paying the state instead of getting a refund.  Would have been nice to know that before I had to pay my Jan estimated tax installment.

(4) The handling of Form 1116 (for foreign tax credit) is very poorly implemented.  TT prompts you during error checking to fill in some required ""explain this line"" forms, instead of doing so during the interview.  Also, the explanations are usually so simple that TT has the information needed to pre-fill these in, instead of asking the user to hunt down where the numbers came from.  Also, if you're not careful, Form 1116 might calculate your foreign tax credits incorrectly, by excluding certain foreign income.  I've found that one MUST review this form manually and make corrections directly in the form and in the relevant 1099 forms, in order to make sure everything is done correctly.  (I've been doing this for years now, there's been no improvement here.)",TT remains a pretty good tax prep software package,1449360000,56,

I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.

Plus, there is a great new screen caption feature, to capture video straight from your screen.  The possibilities are endless for creating videos and presentations whether for work, school, or play.

Plus, with traditional media, i.e. discs becoming ever less popular, the product is now marketed as ""The ultimate digital media toolkit.""  Toast will convert your video files, perhaps from your digital camcorder as an example, to formats to play back easily on your iPad, iPhone, or Apple TV.

Essentially, when you are going to be working with media on your computer, needing to author a disc, share media content, copy your home video file, or do conversion of the content, Toast wants to be what you turn to first.

I've been happily using Windows 7 for a couple of years and really not had any problems. It's faster and more stable than previous versions and relatively simple to use. Windows 8 on the other hand branches from all previous editions, forcing a tablet interface on laptops and desktops that's inappropriate, confusing, pointless and impossible to avoid. While you can still see a ""Desktop"" mode, it doesn't boot directly and there's no way to turn off the endlessly moving carousel of brightly colored squares that practically give me a seizure every time I want to find an application.

Much like the way Microsoft foisted the universally hated ribbon on its audience in Office 2007 and beyond, Windows 8 grants us all the demented ideas of their questionable UI/UX team and to hell with whatever their customers wanted. I have to dive all over the screen from corner to corner to do basic operations and almost anything from ""Shutdown"" to setting up a printer involves more clicks, confusion, frustration and exasperation. It's really, really terrible in every way. I've used Windows all my life and know almost every little feature - but now I know how my Dad feels using a computer as I stare hopelessly lost at the screen.

While Google and Apple products are getting simpler to use with every subsequent iteration (check out the Chromebook), Microsoft is headed in the opposite direction of trying to confuse all levels of its audience from amateur to expert. For some reason, MS is convinced that we're all going to be using touchscreens on our desktops so instead of moving a little mouse 2 inches at a time I have to flail my hands all over my paper-piled desk in a simultaneous effort to find a lost file and induce carpal tunnel syndrome.

As for stability, it's a staggering leap back to the flimsy days of Vista, with a newly revamped blue screen of death to brighten your morning a few times a week.

Installation was a breeze and went quickly. Startup is relatively fast, and once in the program you're presented with  multiple ways to get started, tutorials, etc. Help bubbles are on by default, which is helpful.

As far as functionality, the program just works. Once you get your head around how to use it (there are plenty of tutorials out there to help) the workflow makes sense and things move along quickly. It handles all relevant formats, including 4K video, which is fantastic. The included filters and plugins are extensive and useful, and really I can't see most users outgrowing this software unless you're moving into a professional setting.

Then you've got music - which is a huge bonus. In addition to Sound Forge, which is an incredibly solid and useful music editing program, Acid Music Studio is included, which makes it relatively easy and fun to create your own music for your video projects.

I remember the days of when a new PKZip came out, you re-compressed everything because of better compression rates. Over time (and especially once Windows came into being) PKZip stagnated, and I eventually moved to WinRAR instead of WinZip when that came out, as the early WinZips were nothing to write home about. Later on, when PKWare introduced the new zipx format, I switched back. Have been there since.

That brings us to this one, WinZip 18. I love some of the nice small interface features here. All your modern compressors integrate with the OS well enough, but it's the little ""touchy feely"" things that make it work for me. For some reason I love the end of compression summary screen on this software. It's nothing special, but as a guy from the ancient days of BBS's, I loved seeing those minimal increases in space savings by using the latest, and this screen speaks to that for some reason.

A lot of what is in this software goes way beyond simple file compression. In this day and age when Windows has ""compressed folders"" built in, they have to diffentiate themselves.  To me, that is their zipx compression routines.  These compress files a lot smaller, however, it could be viewed as a different file format.  The tried and true old school zip file is not compatible with zipx.  Given I rarely share my zip files, I use zipx exclusively on my system.  However, I have to share, I need to pick the older compression format so other programs and other people can read them. The newer compression methods (zipx) will actually compress jpg files - something that up until relatively recently wasn't possible. They do this without data loss to the image, too. But this stuff has been the last 3-4 major revisions to WinZip anyway.

Some other stuff that you can do with zip files in this Pro version that you can't with standard old Windows Compressed folders is..

* You can zip and encrypt file attachments in email
* You can schedule certain files for periodic zipping/archiving
* Password protect your zip files - Windows ""Compressed Folders"" can't do that.
* You can preview images inside Zip archives
* You can add watermarks
* You can convert things to a PDF
* You can share files to Facebook, Linkedin, & Twitter (!)

Something else v18 is a big drive to cloud based services such as Box, SkyDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, CloudMe, and SugarSync.  The last two I've never even heard of, but they're trying to make WinZip into a file server of sorts that will take your files and send them to these services by itself.  For me personally, I have no use of that, but I can see where some would.

If you use these services a lot, Winzip could be used to automate/batch process files on your system and send them there.

However, for me personally, I use it pretty much for local file archiving and organization.  In this day and age, one doesn't really need to save tons of space when one has multiple terabytes of storage on their system.  I use it to archive directories into single files mostly - things like old web page archives where you have 4000 files spread out over 150 sub directories.  It's easier to store in a single file, and for me that's the reason I use WinZip mostly.  Yeah, compressed folders could probably do that, but not nearly as nicely as WinZip does.

So yeah, if you're in need of archiving/moving files to the cloud that goes beyond the basics of what built into Windows functions can do, then you'd probably benefit by looking at this software.

I give it four stars over five, as I'd actually prefer it to be a bit simpler, while there's a lot in here, there's also a lot I'll never use - it's got that ""shoot a squirrel with a 357 magnum"" feel somewhat.  Yeah, it can do some things, but I'll never use them.","Very feature packed software, goes way beyond simple file compression",1397606400,2,

What I like about this software...

+ You can install it on multiple Windows PCs. Despite looking for the answer on the Cyberlink website, I've not found that there is a limited number of installs you can make with the included PC disc. There's also a link to download and install the software with the code on your PC disc if you have a laptop without a disc drive. I've put it on (1) Windows 7 and (2) Windows 10 PCs without issue.

+ You can extract audio from video and save it to a file. So if you want a sound bite, or a song from a movie, you can do it!

+ The PowerDVD Remote by Cyberlink for iOS (iPhone) and iPod Touch) works well and the app is free.

+ Installation was easy and completed within about 1 minute. The prompt to view tutorials was very helpful as in watching them you are introduced to the software's features and how to get started.

+ 30 GB FREE storage on the Cyberlink cloud. (Not sure for how long though?)

+ Compatible with Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.

+ Great DVD player on a PC! TrueTheater enhancement does make a positive difference. Both audio and video are better than expected.

+ Auto memory for where you left off in a movie or a slideshow is a wonderful feature.

+ Comprehensive video and audio format support!

+ It's easy to navigate whether in PC or TV mode.

+ 4K and high frame rate video playback is supported, meaning you don't need extra software for playback.

+ Casting to Roku, Chromecast and Apple TV devices - my favorite feature! If you have stuff you want to share, bring your laptop with PowerDVD 16 Ultra on it and a Chromecast device to your location and you're set.

What I wish was better...

-/+ The price is on the high side for not also supporting installation on Mac computers.

-/+ During installation you are given the option to have this program associated with opening video, photos and music by default. Be sure to uncheck the boxes if you don't want the program to take over these functions automatically.

-/+ PC mode and TV mode... why two modes that essentially do the same thing? The menus are slightly different and I'm guessing it has something to do with the integration of the remote app.

-/+ With Windows Media Player and a TV tuner in my PC I was able to use my hard drive as a DVR. I don't see how to do this with this software, but perhaps it's there and I just don't see it? There's a lot to learn about this software.

In ""Message in a Haunted Mansion"" they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasn't horrifying.

Story-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that she's renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.

Graphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.

Sound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.

Gameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.

Length-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.

I had previously been using a free anti-virus solution on my Windows 7 desktop.

I've seen previous versions that consumed considerable resources and really slowed down a computer.  In this instance, I did not see a drop in performance this time around.

I'm still okay with the Win 8 desktop mode but I'm now officially in the hate camp on the metro, New Windows Interface, or whatever that rubbish is called.  Before anyone gives me grief, hear me out.  I've given metro more than enough chances to win me over.  I just can no longer take this Frankenstein version of Windows trying to be all things to all people, tablet and PC.  It's a gimmick and one with irritating repercussions.  Take a recent email for example.  I had to send an immediate response to someone with attachments.  I replied in Windows mail (since it was conveniently there), went to insert attachments and found there was no way to do so.  I did my usual edge of the screen mouse hovering and saw everything from charms, to running programs, to the metro option, but nothing for attachments.  I had to back out of mail and search the web for the answer.  I learned I have to right-click an empty area of the message to bring up a sub-menu on the bottom (not even the normal context menu) that has more options, including inserting attachments.  If I had a touchscreen, all I would have needed to do was swipe.  Therein lies the problem.  Microsoft spent so much time catering to the tablet and touch crowd, they ruined a lot of the traditional desktop functionality in this mode.  What was previously a fast paced mouse clicking, keyboard shortcut typing paradise has been turned into a mess.  I really wish they gave us the option to choose between whether or not we want all that touch garbage installed at all.  I definitely would keep it off my PC and save the space.  It's just not worth the aggravation.  Sure, it's cutesy and all, with it's colorful tiles and live content, but navigation, usability, and usefulness are minimal.  I live in the desktop environment and that's all I want.  So to that end, I'll be going back to Windows 7 for as long as Microsoft supports it.  Just in case this is the new permanent mindset of Microsoft, I invested in a backup.  After being primarily a Windows user for over twenty years, I bought my first MacBook this past fall.  I'd tinkered with OSX and Linux here and there and even own an older iMac, but after trying the release previews of Windows 8 extensively, I figured if I had to learn a radically different OS design, I may as well make the switch to the least radically changed OS. Looks like my gamble paid off.  I am neither an Apple lover (because believe me, they have their issues too), nor a Microsoft lover but I definitely have to agree with Tim Cook's quote, a spot-on assessment of Windows 8:  ""I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don't think it would do all of those things very well.""  In trying to compete with both the iPad and iMac in one swoop, Windows gave up their biggest advantage.  This can only help Linux and OSX.

That sums up my feelings of Windows 8 exactly. It tries to be a tablet and traditional PC combined but the end result is not very good.  I also wanted to point out, in my initial review I spoke of boot times and claims of incredibly fast boot times from people.  Well, I've recently started experiencing these short boot times myself and discovered it's because Microsoft has implemented a new shut-down scheme.  It's not really a ""shutdown"" in the traditional sense but more like an advanced hibernation mode.  I didn't initially experience these superfast boots but have been noticing them more and more lately.  I'm assuming it's because I'm no longer installing programs and other tasks that extend my boots/reboots.  At first, I thought I was somehow accidentally selecting sleep instead of shutdown.  I checked my event viewer and saw that it never mentions shutdown anymore, only sleep regardless of whether I select ""power off"".  I knew something was up, so I did a little digging and found info about the new boot mode.  There are parameters you can use to perform a true shutdown but once again, MS is forcing a PC to behave like a tablet.  I already have a tablet, so Windows 8 is not really necessary.  My advice, if you have a traditional PC and you're happy with Windows 7, stick with it.  If you primarily use your PC for web browsing, playing games and social activity, then Windows 8 isn't a bad choice, but if you're a power user and use your PC in a more traditional manner, you're likely not going to like it.  By the way, I'm STILL missing a couple drivers.  Last time that happened was Windows Vista.  That brought an interesting thought to mind; see if you recognize the pattern:  Windows 95/98, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.  Notice a trend?  Long time Windows users will notice immediately.

So, I installed this past weekend and have been playing around with it since.  So far, my feelings about it are mixed.  I do feel that the uproar over metro (the purists will have to forgive me for calling it that, but it has no real distinguishing name, so it will be metro for this review) vs the desktop is much ado about nothing.  I spend 90% of my time in the desktop and have no problem getting there via the big ""desktop"" button on the metro screen or hitting the Start+B buttons.  The start menu is also overblown.  Yes, I was pretty upset at how Microsoft initially hid the programs and all the steps I had to take to get to them, however, once I figured out how to use charms, navigation became as quick and easy as it was with the Start menu.  Also, just to avoid any confusion, the taskbar is still there.  Yes, the date/time and little icons are all still on the right and your quick-launch shortcuts are still on the left.  Only the Start menu is missing.  Although I'm no fan of the metro interface, it does have its moments.  I like seeing mail, calendar, and other events in real-time live tiles.  Comparing the traditional desktop to metro is like the difference between iOS and Android.  Although metro is useful at times, I'd still prefer the choice to not use it so much.  Speaking of live tiles, that's another concern of mine, security.  From what I've read and heard, be very careful what content you put on the computer, especially photos.  I'm honestly leery about placing any photos or other super sensitive info on my PC now that Windows is so cloud-centric.  It's one thing to know that yes, there is a possibility your system could get compromised and your data illegally stolen; It's quite another when your computer is knowingly advertising your content.  My biggest likes of Windows 8 are increased functionality, better security, SOME features of IE 10, like spell-check (welcome to the 21st century, finally IE...), the mail and calendar integration (No Outlook necessary!) and the live tiles.  Another plus is that you don't ""need"" a touchscreen to navigate either interface.  I find navigating with the mouse to be relatively easy and think I'd prefer it even if I did have a touchscreen, other than the hot spots I'll address in the next paragraph.  So, that's pretty much it for now in the like column.

On the flip side, my list of dislikes is quite lengthy.  First, despite running the Windows Upgrade Advisor and being told many programs and drivers were compatible, many were not.  The funny thing is, Windows installed native drivers for devices it claimed needed updating and did not have native drivers for others it claimed were compatible.  After a lot of searching high and low, I found almost all of the drivers but I'm still missing one driver.  Several of my ""compatible"" programs either wouldn't run properly or wouldn't install at all, despite being listed as compatible in the WUA.  My second gripe is with the navigation.  Although you get accustomed to it, some long time Windows users will be pretty miffed at the changes because most are counterintuitive. Quirky requirements like hovering over random edges of the screen to bring up menus and the lack of traditional navigation options.  Also, some features that should be pretty straightforward take a little detective work to figure out, like how to add additional accounts after mail is set up or how to close metro apps like mail, calendar or even the metro version of IE, which is noticeably different from the desktop version.  They also took away some ease of use such as advance settings in networking.  They made it pretty much like a tablet to configure networking. Speaking of tablets, the merge of desktop and metro touch-oriented OS is a little convoluted.  For instance, there are apps that will only work in one or the other.  An example of this is an application I own that I've used in Windows for over a decade.  Well, they also now offer an app store version.  My desktop version only runs in the desktop mode (even if launched from the metro interface) and the app store version only runs in the metro interface, leading me to believe that the app store version (along with many other apps are really geared toward tablets).  If you thought distinguishing phone from tablet apps was hard in Android, wait until you have fun trying to figure out which apps are geared toward tablets versus PCs in the Windows App Store.  Although this is the last complaint I'll type, the list goes on.  My final complaint is the installation process.  Technically, for an upgrade, you must have a previous version of Windows already installed.  I installed on a clean wiped system (my preference always) and was unable to activate Windows after installation.  I called Microsoft and a nice gentleman assisted me with getting it activated via an alternative method.  I hope Microsoft intends to change this in the future because I do not wish to install a prior OS every time I need to rebuild, nor do I trust their ""erase everything and reinstall Windows"" option because if a nasty enough piece of malware hits you, I don't think any part of your disk is guaranteed safe, even hidden restore partitions.

Overall, I don't regret the upgrade but had I not been pressed into upgrading now or losing the free media center, I likely would have stuck with Windows 7 for the foreseeable future.  I haven't personally observed any of the claimed performance gains nor any of the alleged sub-ten-second boot times, although I think the fast booters were booting from sleep mode and not a full power down.  Despite the aforementioned software and driver issues, I have not yet experienced any stability issues but I also haven't really stressed the system yet with some hardcore encoding or gaming.  Once I've had a chance to work out the kinks and truly test the OS, I'll be certain to report any and all issues encountered.",Headaches with few benefits,1359417600,3,

BACKGROUND:  I've used Paint Shop Pro for years.  In fact, I began using PSP back in the days of Compuserve when I could download a few shareware programs and my employer paid for any that I wanted to keep.  I'm not a graphics artist, but when I need to do any kind of image editing, I can usually find my way around in PSP to do what I need to do.

WHAT I LIKE:

- Installed easily, boots up without issues
- Seems speedy for the amateur that I am
- Has a full set of functions and features

WHAT COULD BE BETTER

In the old days, making a simple web graphic was easy to do.  PSP is so sophisticated now as a Photoshop replacement, it's sometimes not easy to create a simple graphic.  I wish that there were a rich set of wizard functions that would start with a goal in mind, and then have the wizard walk through all the steps involved.  Sometimes I have a simple goal in mind, but it's hard to know where to begin.

These new features are fitting for the current economy and will appeal to buyers to view their shrinking net worths and help them get out of debt.  Genius marketing and product enhancement! ;-)

This review is for upgrading from Quicken 2011 to 2012.  In summary don't expect a lot of feature enhancement, and 2012 appears to be a (mostly) stable release.  I'm a long time Quicken user who upgrades annually.  I use Quicken extensively and my data file is 125Mb with accounts which have thousands of transactions, some dating back to 1993.  The upgrade and conversion from Quicken 2011 to 2012 was seamless.  All of my connections (mostly Direct Connect) to financial institutions worked as they did before.  There are some cosmetic enhancements to the user interface.  I noticed some but not significant performance improvements (I use Quicken on Windows 7 32-bit running on a mid-performance dual core laptop with 4GB of RAM).  Interfacing to financial institutions and downloading transactions appears to have some stability improvement.  There are still some bugs from prior versions which I have learned to work around.  Occasionally Quicken crashes or hangs-up; however, I have never lost transaction data in this version or prior versions.  I can't comment on the enhancements to budgeting and debt cutting tools as I don't use them.

The software is probably getting long in the tooth and requires significant changes to its core architecture.  Quicken was originally designed as a replacement for the checkbook and not managing thousands of investment transactions.  For instance a 401(k) account with an asset allocation among several funds and an employer match which makes purchases each pay period results in thousands of downloaded transactions over a few years.  In the portfolio view, Quicken is painfully slow when displaying an account with many transactions.

With a shift towards cloud computing and use of tablets/mobile devices (and Intuit's acquisition of mint.com), Intuit is unable to significantly invest in the architectural changes required for the existing desktop version of Quicken.  I don't envision significant changes in the future to the desktop version but bug fixes and minor enhancements.",Quicken 2012 Upgrade vs 2011:  Don't expect much!,1318723200,46,

Occasionally they have made disastrous mistakes, and although the underlying program still does its job, the additions or subtractions sometimes get to be appalling. Some update changes were made about 4 to 5 months back (at the very least) which has resulted in an update capability that works something like iTunes. Norton Internet security has basically operated at its optimum with Internet Explorer; this is rather  unfortunate since there are several browsers which are perfectly good, but I'm not NIS compatible.
  The majority of exploits, malware, and virii that afflict Internet Explorer, usually turn out to be self-imposed problems (someone clicked on yes to load an add-in or a toolbar, when they should've clicked no), or the most common source of those selfsame problems come from advertising servers that go to safe pages, and you have no control over the exploit that is going
to be loaded, but Norton catches the issue. A new browser, currently titled AVIATOR, is now out, and once it has a Windows version, it will obviate at least some of the tasks that Norton Internet security has been doing. I  will not comment on AVIATOR, except to say that I would suggest you check it out. Since the constant updating of the core of NIS has been instituted so that it has ""always up-to-date"" engines/programs (not just the standard signature and heuristic updates) I have had way too many technical issues on multiple Windows platforms. It's annoying, and potentially of big problem, but since I need to use Internet Explorer, I need to use NIS.
  The one part that had worked very well up until NIS 2012, was the page login for individual websites: the big change in NIS 2013 was to make the so-called ""vault"" database located in the cloud. Personally, I preferred the local PC to have my database for individual websites, but now I am forced to use the cloud. This issue for me is basically the dealbreaker, since they offer no alternative to a cloud location of the vault , and so once I can satisfactorily find and implement a local webpage login (it looks like KEEPASS will be the choice) I will go for the most immediate Internet security suite that is on a par with Norton Internet security, and in many respects (as far as I have tested) much better. The other two things that you need to have running to either compensate for the new and definitely not improved Norton Internet security, is switch on shadow copy if you have a Windows system, and run Norton Utilities regularly. I definitely regret giving Norton/Symantec a bad review, but the product at this point is not something I can safely recommend if you want to have good security.

UPDATE 3_30_14: I have to give some credit where credit is due. One of my laptops yesterday was affected by an unusual download, or an access through a web page. It was basically close to inoperable. I tried to run the utilities I could run and nothing worked except for  Norton Power Eraser. I was not in the habit of using this for a while and it ran a Rootkit scan and a registry scan, and it fixed ALL of the basic problems that had the Laptop crippled. I have Norton still running with all the heuristics and checked it afterwards. This was an amazing fix and it was quick.

Download time will depend on how long it takes your broadband provider to deliver the 665 MB executable. This is the only variable out of Microsoft's control. The things they could control don't add up to a compelling reason to upgrade from any earlier version of Office.

The interface is essentially the same tabbed interface from Office 2007 (that probably still stumps previous users of Office 2003 and earlier suites).

Installation on a desktop computer(4 GB RAM, 3GHZ Intel dual core processor) running Windows 7 Professional and with an existing Office 2003 Professional version already installed took about 20 minutes. Installation was trouble-free. While the document history entries in the Windows start menu were erased after the install, the recent documents history were available within each of the Office applications. I don't use Outlook for email at home, but do use it for calendaring. All of my existing entries were preserved and displayed immediately in Outlook; it also recognized my existing preference to start Outlook in the calendar view).

While the interface is familiar, application launch time is slightly faster, and there is improved feedback to users on recent files accessed in a navigation pane that appears under the File tab.

So, with a familiar interface, a problem-free install and apparent improvements in navigation and responsiveness...why 2 stars? Because the Office Professional suite is very expensive. The only reason I'm doing this review is because I had access to a deeply discounted purchase price via an educational licensing agreement. But if you are currently running an earlier version of Office, I can't offer a single compelling reason to sink anywhere from 220 dollars (for a product key to activate the trial versions on new PCs) to more than 400 dollars (for a version delivered on DVD).

If you have very basic productivity suite needs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) you can consider the stripped down ""student version"" instead for much less...if your needs don't include Outlook, Access or Publisher. Alternatively, if you have an affiliation with an educational institution that has an academic licensing arrangement, you should have a access to a very reasonably priced Professional version.

One of the biggest complaints that I read about Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security is the cost.

Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, I'll use the rebates to do the same.

With Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.

Symantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as lon as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers I've managed: usually 5-7 at one time) I'll stick with Symantec.

Personally, I feel this is an over-the-top lock-in, so to say. They should be more like your anti-virus subscription, letting you know that your subscription is about to expire, giving YOU the option of renewing instead of them just automatically renewing.

So if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage. So you better know right off the bat if you are ready to make a true commitment to using Sage 50 Accounting software, because that is truly what it is... a commitment!

As I stated before in my 2013 version review, if you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget and can absolutely commit to using this software. However, if you do not need the the Payroll & Tax software, then this is indeed a wonderful and premium accounting and inventory software.",A Great Accounting & Inventory Software,1375574400,,

Banking:
Finally, a ""print check"" button - no more searching through lists of what to print.
Electronic Signature - now you can scan in a copy of your signature and have it print directly on the checks! No need to sign hundreds of checks anymore.
Account Reconciliation - now uses a lighter font to show you the ""cleared"" items, so you can actually tell what items you have clicked to clear and those you haven't.
Enter Bills Section - now has a sidebar that shows recent transactions (which helps eliminate duplicate entries), open balances, and any notes you've created.

Reports:
Report Center - vastly improved with a scrolling visual selection of report options. Now you don't have to open a report to see what it actually contains. You can look at each report and what it tells you - as well as adjust dates, all before you pull it up to view!

General:
Back-up status is right on the front page. It tells you the last backup date and time, so you know when you are up to date.
QB Help Center - a realtime help bar with frequently asked questions in the form of a member forum. Find quick solutions from people like you who are using the same software.
QB Connect - access your company data, record payments, and make invoices from any internet device - even a smartphone!
Clean-up Company Data - lets you enter an ""as of"" date to clean closed transactions and enters them as monthly summary journal entries, to greatly clear up your company file.
Search Feature - tons of options to find exactly what you are looking for, and fast!
List Import - import lists from Excel, including customer and vendor lists with address and phone number.
Attach Feature - Allows you to scan directly into QB and attach to anything with the paperclip icon. Scan in a cancelled check copy and attach it to the paid bill; scan in important documents and attach it to an employee file; scan notes on a project and attach it to a vendor/customer.
Before closing - QB gives you a ""are you sure"" prompt to prevent accidental closure of the software.

First  minor problem on a Windows 10 PC didn't run autorun, had to manually double-click SETUP on the CD. On starting the setup first thing it does is check the version to let you know if there is a newer version online (optional if you do not have internet connectivity at the time of install). Crashed part of the way through my first install, but worked correctly on the second install.

Second minor problem, software asks for a activation key which is not labeled or listed anywhere on the package, instructions, or DVD. In fact while it asks for an activation key, it wants you to type in what is called a ""SERIAL NUMBER"" on the back of the DVD envelope. How hard would it be to actually have the software call it a serial number of label the number on the DVD envelope the same as the software description (activation key). Kinda amateur in my opinion. It is what you'd expect to see in a $5 download not a $90 product.

My DVD works fine to convert *.mp video from cell phones or from AVCHD (from a video camera -- in my case from memory stick or USB).

I'm not a software designer or a computer expert but am reasonably adept and skilled on the computer and can for the most part fix nearly every problem I encounter. I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.

The problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause. At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.

Low and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.

The new interface, to my way of thinking, is not as good as prior versions. Installation itself can be an adventure in frustration as it was for me. Worse, taking the damn thing off presents unique problems as well.

I told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear! He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning. My uncle called me yesterday. He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton. He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing. He told me he should have acted sooner thereby saving him all sorts of problems and heartaches.

I've replaced Norton Antivirus with Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and Zone Alarm both of which are highly regarded. Other highly regarded antivirus programs that are NOT resource hogs and do not cause the multitude of problems caused by this bloated pig of a software program are AVG antivirus from Grissoft and Avast! antivirus - both work great.

If you are having unexplained problems with your computer that your anti-virus program and spyware programs are not solving and if you have this bloated pig of a program on your computer then you need to delete it.

Norton is busy destroying its franchise. I will not put ANY Symantec software on my computer. They are quirky, resource hogging, intrusive garbage which are nearly impossible to completely uninstall from your computer.

The product came along just as our 10 year old grandson was beginning to create a video of his own, and wanting to edit it.  What a great opportunity, I thought, to see just how easy it is to learn and use.  To be honest, it's a bit confusing because there was no instruction manual or even a help button that was apparently available, yet it says it has over 500 features.  I'm big on documentation, and this was lacking.

We decided to turn it over to Mr. Brilliant (the 10 year old), and he dove in an intuitively figured it out and seems to have mastered it, or at least used it quite productively.  So, asking him how it was, he just said he likes it.  From him, that's a big endorsement.  And literally, we could not pull anything else out of him about it - he was too busy using it.  Even later, he was ""too busy"" to discuss it, and just reiterated that he liked the program and it worked fine for him.

So, if a 10 year old (admittedly bright beyond his years) can figure it out easier than an adult with plenty of experience using a computer, perhaps that's a great endorsement.  I only hesitate to give it a 5-star rating because I simply haven't had a need (or the time) to personally sit down with it and try to plow through all its not-so-wonderfully documented ""500 features"" to do a really thorough assessment of it.  Unfortunately, there's a time factor involved with producing Vine reviews in order to stay active in the program, so I wanted to at least get something useful up on the product.  And quite honestly, the more I thought about it, the more it did seem significant that if a 10 year old boy could sit down with it and get it up and productively running to edit his own videos, it can't be a shabby product.  It just might have been nice if Cyberlink took care of us ""old folks"" that never had computers when we were kids (I started with punch cards and Fortran IV, back before floppy discs and monitors had even been thought of).

I would highly recommend you go through the tutorial that comes with the software (it takes about an hour), as it gives you a high level introduction of how to use it.

There is a slight learning curve of what you have to do when you're adding chapters, text within the chapter, etc. and if you're like me you have to go to the online forum where your question has probably been answered.  However, its all pretty straight forward and you can edit / switch stuff around to your hearts content.  One of the many useful features is the ability to store your research material / notes / trash files electronically for reference (but they won't translate over to your final eBook): thats very handy as you're going back to your document either to finish it, refine it, or as in my case updating for a new edition of a reference guide.

After going through the tutorial, compiling an existing book that was originally in Microsoft Word didn't take that long at all.  What I particularly liked was the automatic generation of a linkable table of contents for Kindle-compiled books, but what I wish it had was a way to hyperlink to other pages / sections of your eBook.

If you're considering using this for compiling a Kindle-related book, you will need to install the free Kindle Gen software from Amazon.  It takes all of 15 seconds or so to convert a text into the Kindle format, ready for uploading to Amazons platform online.

At just $40 for the download here on Amazon (as well as from the Literature and Latte website), this will save you a heck of a lot of time.  If you are a self-published author and want to compile your books into the Kindle format on your own vs. hiring someone, Id highly recommend trying the free 30 day trial period before purchasing a license to see if this is for you.

""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing.

OpenOffice not doing a good enough job for what you need? Are you put off by Office 2013, which doesn't offer three product keys for your trouble? Are you even more put off with Microsoft turning Office into Software as a Service with Office 365?

Well, you're going to have to accept some compromises, namely the hated Ribbon and not having all the Office apps. But there are Z number of people who have late Windows XP/early Windows Vista era PCs that are perfect for secondary production running Windows 7 from a retail upgrade disk-and when you do the clean install upgrade for Windows, which you will eventually have to do due to Windows rot, you are going to need Office and you may never get up the budget to where you want to invest in Office 2010 or later for such a low-end often barely Aero-capable PC, so this is perfect as long as you temper your expectations.

With properly set expectations and a legal copy of Office 2007 Home and Student, you can now get down to how it works.

It works by running basic Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote tasks  It's not going to wow you like a new version of Office, but a common thread I've read in hundreds of reviews for various versions and editions of Office is why do they break what works in the previous version when they release a new version? Well, by buying an older version, there are no surprises as regards what Office can and can't do, because it's been around for however many years it's been since the date the version in question (Office 2007 Home and Student, which is 7 years as of when I write this) was made.

What can it actually do? Well, Word's fully featured (as long as you're using it for home or student use.) Excel is fully featured as regards the base program (again, the same caveat applies.) PowerPoint will get your presentations done, although you'll miss some of the customizations of later versions. OneNote is fully featured, and it along with PowerPoint have the caveat that they're for home or student use. The only thing that really lacks in Home and Student versus let's say Ultimate (which I use for troubleshooting through over-engineering), is the Microsoft Office Tools-you can't expect fancy things like Business Contact Manager and the accompanying copy of SQL Server 2005 Express.

In case you're wondering, I'm reviewing this for my aunt and uncle, who sat there and bought a PC in May of 2009 and thanks to a certain ability I have to troubleshoot combined with them buying retail Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade through the Best Buy fulfillment of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option that was current at the time along with retail Office 2007 Home and Student that they beat out of HP's customer (dis)service-albeit with having to pay for it, I get to (and thoroughly enjoy) troubleshooting their PC whenever it is having an issue because I'm on a mission to keep them off of the crack Windows that is Windows 8/RT/8.1/RT 8.1/Windows Phone 8X/Windows Phone 8.1x and I thoroughly enjoy every time I can fix their PC that uses this software.

Office 2007 Home and Student was a change for them at first from the WordPerfect Office suite they were using on their old XP computer, a Dell Dimension 2400 (They replaced it with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 7750+ 4GB RAM 500GB HD HP Pavilion Slimline S5120Y. But then again so was Vista and then 7-they didn't have too much trouble with Vista, but Windows 7 Home Premium combined with this version of Office makes them able to do everything they would ever want to do with Office and a PC. When that changes, they will upgrade-and so far it's not changing.

I just think that Office 2007 (whether lowly Home and Student or mighty Ultimate or something in between like Professional) didn't deserve the reputation it got as regards the Ribbon. People were (and some still are) so angry about the Ribbon that they don't like Office because of the Ribbon. I know I am not as qualified as some people to speak due to my aversion to command line interfaces, whether of the old school DOS/Unix variety or whether of the newfangled Windows PowerShell variety, but I know this for a fact:

Once I properly configured their PC with Windows 7 Home Premium Retail Upgrade on a clean install and reimported their programs, files, and settings, they were using it productively as could be until a virus hit that forced them to pay someone way too much to repair their computer. I was able to set it right and from the moment I first showed them how to do basic things like bold, underline, italics, margins, indentation, in other words showed them where Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student put the tools they were using in WordPerfect Office, they've been happily using Office with the Ribbon.

I hate to discount those who have had negative experiences with Office 2007, because I don't like most change-especially not the licensing restrictions growing ever tighter since 2000, but I haven't had any problems with the Ribbon either.

So with the Ribbon discounted for us and our family, we can now move on to infinitely more pressing matters. Which is how does Office (specifically 2007 Home and Student) perform in real world tasks? Well, it doesn't make you have to renew the usage rights to it every year, it supports the .docx/.xlsx/.pptx trio, and it has a user interface that aside from being different is actually usable (if you can figure out what each button on each section of the ribbon is for, which ToolTips really help with that and they're on by default).

In summation, for the reasons outlined above, Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student is worth the money if you can get a legal copy. I recommend it as long as it's needs match up well with what you need out of (specifically Microsoft) Office,

Take this as you will, 2 families' experiences with Office 2007, one Ultimate, one Home and Student, which is positive and we continue to use Office 2007 to this day.","It's maybe behind the curve, but you can still do a lot with it.",1391817600,,

With some many products on the market, which  one do we choose.  If you anything like me, you have multi pcs in your house and they all need protection.  So AVG Internet Security, when it comes to this I think of couple of things.  Will it really protect my systems, how much will it slow down my PC. I've always looked for a balance of both.  These products will either bring your PC to a halt while its protecting you or will not slow your machine at all and provide minimum protection.  So Let give AVG a try.  Since we all know about these products I will get to the point and let you know exactly what you need to make your own decision and A/V products.

Installation is a breeze, though it requires a system restart. During installation though you have the option to install their toolbar, which has some security benefits.  From looking around at some independent antivirus labs, they gave it a pretty good score. It had good malware detection, the linkScanner blocks exploits (love this feature for my babies), malicious sites. Antiphishing component less accurate than IE alone so I wouldn't use this feature.  I would let IE handle this.  Free identity theft recovery service,  includes tune-up utility which will only run once, you will have to pay extra for this feature (which stinks!  you can perform a single tune-up for free or unlimited tune-ups by purchasing the $29.99 product.  I had assumed that those who purchased the full suite would also get full access to the tune-up tool. I assumed wrong. Even if you've bought the suite full access to the tune-up tool requires a separate purchase. Do go ahead and run it to take advantage of that one-time performance tune-up, but make sure to do so when you can spare some time to try the other features during the 24-hour trial period. Accurate spam filtering.  Small effect on system performance (which is HUGE for me).

AVG's security suite offers three things the free antivirus doesn't: a so-so firewall, an accurate spam filter.  The paid version is a bite more stable than than the free version.  There's so much protection in the free product that it's hard to justify paying for the suite.  AVG Internet Security 2011 is a good security suite, but on a practical level, I feel it really needs to be revamped and simplified. The antispam and firewall settings in particular include way too many settings that users simply should not touch. And the main window that tracks fourteen distinct security components could be streamlined to better inform the user.

A huge portion of the suite's components are available in the free antivirus, and the value-add components don't impress. The firewall is so-so,  the antispam is very good, but many users don't need antispam. Surprisingly, the tune-up feature requires yet another payout for full functionality. And for the market sub-group who want parental control in a suite, AVG is a no-go.",For the Price I expected better.,1316649600,,

CorelDraw would be an ideal solution for a small business or organization that does a fair amount of advertising-creation and publication design in-house. With one application (well-priced when compared to buying both Illustrator and InDesign), the content creator can achieve very professional results.

The app is also friendly to first-time users. It offers more than 80 customizable document templates that will be useful to newbies. While there is still a learning curve for new users, the app has an intuitive interface that will help get the user up and running relatively quickly.

The problem for CorelDraw is that Illustrator has become the default vector app in the design/pre-press community. Professionals should still start with Illustrator and Quark and/or InDesign -- they're the industry standards. While CorelDraw is very good, it would need to be awesome to unseat Illustrator, and that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

CorelDraw has new file formats that enable docs to be shared between CorelDraw and Adobe apps. This is handy, but also shows which format and apps are the most common -- Adobe's. If you're in a design situation where you're going to have to worry about your files working in Adobe formats, you should just go ahead and use Adobe products.

Another thing: Because the Adobe products are the standard, there are numerous training DVDs and books to purchase that can help you get the most out of your apps. With CorelDraw, not so much.

I feel bad for good apps like CorelDraw. I wish I could talk just about the app itself and not bring in a discussion about Adobe's competitive products, but given the way the design industry works -- or any technology-based industry, for that matter -- you always have to bring the front-running application into the mix.

That being said, if you're not a graphic designer or a pre-press operator but are instead a multitasking, Windows-based employee at a company or organization who has been put in charge of creating brochures, pamphlets and the like, CorelDraw will answer your needs very well. If you're someone who doesn't need to share files often with design colleagues, publishing clients or service bureaus (who are most likely using Adobe apps almost exclusively), then you have no worries.

BTW, if you're already using CoreDraw, it's worth the upgrade. The font-identifying tool alone makes it worth it, at least for me.",A great solution for non-professional designers,1219881600,4,

The learning curve was so high and even today... still hate it.  Then Office 2010 came out and it was a step in the right direction but again, still hard to find things.  Whomever their experts are that says that the RIBBONS are awesome... must have been power users and not the average person.  Now we have Office 2013 and Office 365 which are basically the same thing, minor differences.

Office 2013 is yours.  You own it.  There are no additional fee's beyond the initial cost of the software.  There is one thing though, which was just pointed out to me (The reason i'm editing this review.)  Office 2013 Retail... is not really retail at all.  It's really OEM.  What that means is... you can only install Office 2013 on 1 pc/laptop and that's it.  Period.  End of discussion.

The reason that's important is because Office 2013 is licensed not to YOU the buyer... but to the PC it's installed upon.  So, if you ever sell that PC or scrap it for a new one... the copy of office goes with it.  You cannot uninstall from that machine and then install/transfer the license to another machine.  If your computer/laptop crashes and you have to put in a new hard drive and then restore from backup/reinstall everything, technically this is now a new machine as the Hard Drive has changed.  It's not the original pc anymore and therefor your copy of Office 2013 may not work any longer because it will detect that there was a change and the license specifically states that it's licensed to the original computer...  (so, if your pc changes, it's not original and goodbye office 2013).

This is huge... because Microsoft Office 2013 is very expensive... and now thanks to Microsoft... they are totally ripping off their customers.

So your choice is this... you buy 1 full retail version of Office 2013 for big huge bucks... you install it and then that's it... when that PC crashes or is retired for a new one, tough.  You will have to buy a new copy of MS Office all over again.  OR.... you can buy Office 365 but make sure you keep reading below about it's drawbacks with the primary one being... Office 365 is subscription based... if you don't pay EVERY YEAR... it will stop working and then what do you do?  (and... trying to keep the checks and balances... what happens when Microsoft starts goosing the renewal prices up every year, just like your landlord does?)

Office 365 is a rental.  Every year you have to pay to use it.  The benefit here is that you can install on up to 5 computers/laptops (vs. the boxed which goes on only 1 machine) and the benefit is that any time there is an office update (like when 2015 comes out) you automatically get the updates on all of your pc's.  So you're always using the latest and greatest.  Plus, 5 machine is only $20/machine.

So there are pro's and con's to each.  The thought of RENTING software I hate.  I try very hard that when it comes to software purchases, I go with lifetime subscriptions.  Office 365 is literally ""renting"".  Every year you must renew your license or it expires and you're left in the cold.  All of your office programs will eventually just stop working.

Anyhow, I like Office 2013.  I love Outlook in particular.  I see there's a few bugs, but that's ok.  They are minor and this software is what, a month old?  I like how you can reply from the preview pane, I like the layout and I like how I can customize things better.  I also like word much better than previous versions.  I'm still working out the menu's/ribbons because I freaking hate the RIBBON that Microsoft keeps telling me how great it really isn't.  :)

That all said you need to go read on the difference between the retail box and the 365 subscription.  Regardless of which way you go... I can say that for the first time in a long time, I'm much happier with the Microsoft Office product as a whole.

As you will see with comments about my original review... even I did not do as much reading as I should have... for I totally missed the part about the full retail Office 2013 being licensed to the PC and not the individual and therefore, if the PC crashes or simply gets to old... then too bad.  You buy another Office License.

This version is a 2 year subscription and while the free does antivirus scanning there are a lot of ""features"" that are well worth the cost, and with so much spyware/adware trying to sneak into your Windows PC's these days you really need a top notch program protecting your PC and your sensitive data.

AVE has done a great job in their anti-spyware scanner, and they have a linkscanner which is very useful. In fact they have this on their free version as the AVG Toolbar for your internet browser. It tells you which links are safe, which are known threats and which ones you should be cautious with.

So while a lot of the 'unique"" features are in the free version, the paid has the added protection of adware/spyware which really these days its more likely you get spyware/adware over a virus so you really need the protection. And from my experience with the big name companies and AVG I have always opted to choose AVG. It's what I run at home and have total confidence in and love the fact you never even know it's there except for the icons running in the task bar. If you want to view the menu's you can pull them up, but with the autmated scans, updates and repair features you install it and can forget it if you aren't the type that wants to tweak it.

I tested Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 on a custom-built desktop PC running Windows 7 (64-bit) with AMD A10 processor, 16 GB of RAM, two 480 GB solid state drives, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 graphics card.

As others have mentioned, a major annoyance with this software is that it tries to install bloatware (Simpliclean) as part of the default installation. This should be an immediate red flag. I normally tell people to throw away any software that tries to install useless bloatware like this, but I wanted to review this software to see how it works. In any case, you can click on the option to avoid installing Simpliclean, so it's not too terrible.

Like most modern software, you have to register online before you can start using this software, which is annoying because it means you have to give the software developer your email address and they can start sending you spam emails ... but that's unfortunately the way that just about every software developer works.

After you finish the installation and online registration Magix Movie Edit Pro is remarkably simple to use ... especially if you've used other video editing applications. One of the nicest features of this software is the ability to watch live playback of the video during the editing process; which works VERY well here. Granted, I might have enjoyed unusually smooth video playback during my edits because of the 16 GB of RAM and the high-performance graphics card in my desktop, but I've used other video editing apps on this desktop that can't playback video like this during the editing process.

It's nice that you don't have to render (finish) the video edits in order to watch the entire video ... this makes it easier to spot problems with your editing and fix those problems before you finish.

Other features that work particularly well in Magix Movie Edit Pro are the object tracking and stabilization (if you are shooting 1080p HD or 4K video and your video is ""a little"" shaky then you can smooth out some of the shaky camera movement in the final video). The important basics are here too; like timeline control over multiple audio tracks, transitions, images/slides, and picture-in-picture. The option to slow down or speed up a section of the video during the editing process is also here.

In short, Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 has all the stuff you need to edit a quality video for YouTube, but there are a lot of other applications with similar (or better) features that cost less (Corel VideoStudio Pro for a one-time cost of $40-$50) or you can find more professional software for a little extra money (Adobe Premiere Pro via Creative Cloud for $20/month).

My biggest concern about this software is that it tries to install bloatware by default during installation and it requires you to shut down various other applications (like Microsoft Office) in order to complete the installation ... which makes me worried that this software is messing with other applications that I've previously installed on my PC. If you aren't paranoid about what Magix Movie Edit Pro might be doing to your PC in the background and you just want video editing software that is easy to use then this gets the job done.",It works!

I would not consider this to be a product on the level of Adobe Premiere. Granted, that should be something of a no-brainer, but it helps to have proper expectations. As reasonably-robust video-editing software at a fair price, Nero 2014 works well. The Blu-Ray viewer works wonderfully, saving the need to purchase other stand-alone software. The burning process has, in my experience, worked flawlessly. I don't have any coasters, but I can't say I've burned more than a handful.

I also don't understand why people get this because they need Office compatibility. I opened a document from Word 2003, and in Pages it looked like the original, but in Word 2008 the margins were different and words showed up on different lines.

The program looks nice with its blue glass, but to tell you the truth, iWork looks more elegant and has its good looks without sacrificing intuitive use. I mean, in iWork you can have the text formatting toolbar always show, but in Office you always have to choose between one kind of toolbar set or another (in a side-window). For people used to using Office 2003 on Windows (like me), you'll actually feel less at home in Office 2008 than in other programs (like iWork or even the simple OpenOffice.org).

I have Office 2008 and iWork, and while I can highly recommend iWork, I keep the Office icons out of the Dock. I even find myself opening Word documents in Pages more often than in Word because its just more reliable and it loads the documents just fine.

I can't explain that.

In my testing it's a toy application.

I have a large iCal database with about 6,000 events living on a G5 iMac running OS X 10.5.5. This is a relatively large event collection (though it would not stress Outlook at all) and my hardware is dated -- so I expected a few performance issues.

I did not expect dreadful performance. Minutes to open the Bento (SQLite really) database. A minute to add a single event record. Inability to add a record when viewing a query (filtered list). No drop down for calendar names ...

If you've used any database you'll be surprised to learn you can't emulate a join; you can't find common names in two lists for example.

For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).","Expensive, but worth it! painless and powerful",1099440000,2,

For me (someone who understands the ideas of accounting, P&L, gross vs. net etc., but does NOT have professional bookkeeping experience), the simplicity of QuickBooks, its easier transaction editing and reporting, and its use of (mostly) real-world terminology was what I wanted in an accounting package. The more professional packages were just a bit too confusing for non-accountant me.

However, times have changed. It's no surprise that if you are more comfortable with traditional bookkeeping techniques, or require a more robust feature set, Sage 50 (which used to be Peachtree) may be the way to go; what is a surprise is that Sage 50 is now accessible enough to an average business person that I'm comfortable with it.

The terminology and setup in Sage 50 are more traditional (from a professional bookkeepers perspective) than QB's, which means when my accountant asks for something specific I can deliver it without translating his request into QuickBooks terminology.

And the feature set on the Premium edition of Sage 50 is excellent. Inventory support includes Average, FIFO, LIFO unit-specific costing. You're also allowed up to 10 pricing levels per item, which is HUGELY useful to me as I manufacture and sell at both retail and wholesale levels to multiple customers with varying discounts.

Reporting is excellent, and there's more customization available in the dashboard as well as in reports. Invoices, order, and other forms are also customizable.

After some time with Sage 50 I've found I like it better than QuickBooks. I prefer the interface, I like the customizable dashboard, I prefer the inventory options, and love the multi-level pricing. I'm also a bit burned out on QuickBooks' business policies: too much advertising within the program, features that I think should be there that need to be purchased (or don't exist), buggy operation at times and poor (in my experience) technical support (on that last topic, I have NOT called Sage for tech support but HAVE heard good things about them).

A few years ago, the useability gap between QuickBooks and the more ""professional"" accounting programs was quite large: large enough that I always worked with QuickBooks. With this version of Sage 50 though, that gap has closed enough that I've found it may be worth the time it takes to relearn a few things to be able to use what feels to me like a more robust, more professional solution.

Yeah, I'm that guy.  Now that I've (finally) discovered Norton 360, I'll be spending less time with the relatives once they buy copies.

I've used Norton Internet Security for years and have recommended it often, particularly in recent years when Symantec made it run faster and leaner.  I never went for Norton 360 before receiving a review copy because frankly I couldn't really understand what it was from a quick glance.

Norton 360 does everything Norton Internet Security (NIS) does, and more, but with a different interface.

It includes firewall and antivirus protection as well as Identify Safe, identical to NIS.  (Your NIS settings and Identity Safe vault all migrate if you switch to 360 from NIS.)  Identify Safe is primarily a password manager, saving and entering your passwords for you under the protection of a single master password so that you are more likely to use appropriate, complex and site specific passwords for the web sites that you visit.

360 includes features in two areas beyond NIS:  Backup and PC Tuneup.

The PC Tuneup portion is where I jump for joy for its ability to save me from spending time cleaning up computers for friends and relatives.  It automatically does the things that I do manually to their machines, including:

1. Removal of Windows temporary files (no more searching %temp%, %tmp% and all of the other places that these things hide)

2. Removal of Internet Explorer temporary files

3. Startup Manager - controlling the many hidden programs that launch when you start your computer.  Way easier than running MSConfig, the Norton 360 Startup Manager lets you mark non-essential startup items as ""delayed"" - so that your computer starts up in a jiffy, and then these things are launched somewhat later (reported to be 5 minutes) by 360 itself.  For example, there is a Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader item in most people's startup group.  These allow Office applications and Reader to launch faster when you need them, but at the cost of slowing down the time before you get control of your mouse when you start your computer.  With 360, you get your desktop sooner - and these things can still get launched, just a little bit later.  (Or you can disable them - which has no affect on the functionality of Office or Reader - just makes them launch slower.) Etc.

4.  Registry Cleanup - the Windows Registry is a single, huge database that all software on your computer stores settings in.  The bigger and more cluttered it gets, the slower the computer runs.  360 can find entries for software that has been uninstalled and did not clean up after itself and tidy things up.

5.  Internet Explorer history cleanup - nothing special, other than it can be scheduled to run at times you choose

6.  Disk Optimization - defragmentation is essential to fast disk performance on Windows machines.  The defragger that comes with Windows itself is fine, but must be run manually.  The Norton 360 one can be scheduled to run automatically, eliminating the issue on most computers of the user either not knowing how to defrag, or continuously forgetting to do it.

All of these tune-up activities can be set on a schedule to keep things running smoothly.

Finally, 360 adds a Backup service that can backup via the internet to the ""cloud"", or to local media. This is useful and adds to the completeness of the product, but the user interface is so poor, that I take one star away in this review.

Symantec gives you 2 GB of online storage with your Norton 360 registration.  You can purchase more, but at a hefty charge relative to competitors.  You can access this storage through a Norton product or the n360.backup.com web site;  you would have to upgrade your license annually to maintain this 'cloud' backup.  But, the backup service can run automatically, incrementally uploads only files that have changed, and knows where they came from if you need to restore a file right back to its original location.  This is an excellent option for off-site backup of really important files that would make your life miserable if the disappeared in a  fire or explosion.  But, of course, it is slow to transfer large files.

Note:  your files backed up to online storage are only as secure as your Norton account login password - hackers could try to access your files via the web interface which is accessed purely with your Norton account login credentials.  And, the web interface can be outrageously slow.  It just took the site 30 seconds just to display my My Documents folder which contains a single (test) file.  On the plus side, the web interface to your online storage has a search function so that you can quickly find the file you're looking for.

You can also backup to thumb drive, optical media, a hard disk, or a network location (mapped to a drive letter).

The negative about the backup system is that  you do not have a normal Explorer-like browser tree to select or exclude the files to be backed up.  Instead you have a horrendously ugly long scrolling list of full path names to files - no enclosing folder, nothing, to make it easy to browse and find files that you want to exclude/include.  There is not one person who I help with their computer troubles who would have a slight clue as to what these long file path names mean relative to their data.  I just don't know what Symantec was thinking of, putting this in a program otherwise designed for everyday Windows users rather than tech geeks.  It is not just this list, but the whole backup process which would confuse my less techie friends and relatives - they need a wizard to lead them through the process.

One last thing I like about 360 - which is at version 5.1.0.29 as I write this (an automatic update) - is that in the Activities and Scans window, there is a checkbox to shut down the computer when activities are complete.  So, there's no excuse not to save energy when you leave the computer for the night - let 360 download updates, do backups and Tune-up activities, and then shut your computer down when it is finished.",Norton 360 is the way to go,1310601600,3,

This software has a wide range of applications built into a single user interface - not just file compression anymore. I admit that I don't have a pressing need to use zipped files except on rare occasions to attach photos and other documents to emails.  JPEG files are highly compressed already.  The typical reduction for me is about 20% overall.  I compressed several text documents and the compression ranged from as much as 90% down to about 24% depending upon the file I chose.  Compression is very fast - only a few seconds typically.  But I have a very fast CPU running at 4.6 GHz.

Conversion to PDF files takes a little longer, but still very fast. It seemed to take longer than it actually did - still measured in seconds of maybe 10 to 15 seconds depending on the file size and content.

I've somehow managed to get by without compression software for thirty years. Hard disks have very high capacity and are relatively cheap these days.  But now that SSDs are becoming ubiquitous in laptop computers, the need to compress files has returned - along with the need for encryption of very sensitive data that most people have loaded on their laptop computers, especially worrisome when traveling. And this software application package includes encryption.

The price is somewhat high for pure compression software, but since they bundled numerous extra applications, the value is fairly good. The included conversion to PDF documents is very useful. Cloud storage can be particularly sensitive.  I for one have avoided cloud storage - very cautious what people might be able to obtain through hacking.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: A shot back into time as we are on the cusp of the Great Depression [1930] in Nancy Drew's latest adventure mystery.  What can we learn from this era? What timeless things are ours to explore in the town of Titusville [in the midwest]?  I found fascination about this time warp, but actually learned nothing unique as I used the tools and ideals brought out from that decade.

INITIAL SCORE: 85

CHARACTERS:

Emily Crandall:  Nancy is out to learn from a friend of a friend what is upsetting this teenager and soon is on a two-part mystery that involves theft of family jewelry and a possible forgery of an estate will.  Emily was definitely distraught as she dealt with insecurities of being financially defunct, her mother passing away a month prior, her odd new guardian, and strange things happening to her [moving framed pictures and voices in her room].  I never got the sense she was insane; just tense. Emily did lose a bit of control at the end when she verbally attacked Nancy; I didn't take too much offense in that, although I probably should have.

Jane Willoughby: This is Emily's mother's best friend and she got under my skin right from the start.  Her Minnesota voice was out of place I felt and the strange lingo of ""What's cooking?"" irritated me to the fact that I avoided her if I could.

Richard Topham: Spitting image of John O'Hurley http://images.playbill.com/photo/o/h/ohurleycue200.jpg  and the resident ESP paranormal psychic that continues to practice on the grounds.  He was close colleagues with Josiah Crowley, the eccentric rich man who owned the Lilac Inn and is now the direct benefactor of the will that is now being contested.  I thought it a little arrogant to have him infer I needed to pass a test in order to converse with him, but I also found it fascinating since I aced it!

Jim Archer: This banker was my #1 suspect, because there was something about his financial dealings he won't making clear to me and he seemed friendly in a bizarre way.

Carson Drew/Bess:  This was the most grown up I have ever heard from Nancy's dad as compared to the later versions where he sounds less gruff and slightly younger in his views. Bess was the same delight as always.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
Totally different from any of the other ND adventures which is quite obvious. I didn't say it was an excellent score necessarily, but I give HER points for bringing out the era's style.  Graphics were decent, though learned nothing new about the era except perhaps the roadster and black/white photos of the early 20th century after the first World war.  Sound effects and detail of the ladder being sprung in the barn were fantastic.  The businesses and residents of Titusville were hugely entertaining as you delivered telegrams in the adventure. I loved Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farms, haha

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 86

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The golf game was strangely not as fun as I would have imaged, although I loved the golfball color challenge. Also not as enjoyable as I thought was the conversation cue ESP test. It took me a long time to integrate the sentences Richard spoke with the traditional card symbols. The Hobo puzzle was easy and okay. I like the test in the parlor involving the slider Shakespeare characters.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 86

ADVENTURE ENDING: I wasn't totally compelled with the plotline, but I wouldn't necessarily say I was bored neither. Thank God that the telegrams weren't a required evil the entire time as that would have made the game extremely tedious.

CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 87

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me three days [9 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 75

My Strong Points: The games were completed at a steady pace and I rarely needed help from the walkthrough although I had trouble finding out where to continue the adventure after being derailed mentally sometimes.

My Weak Points: I did not guess the culprit!!!  I didn't think I was that off-base, but I WAS so I have to give HER a bit of credit for stumping me [something they hadn't done in the last seven adventures thus far].

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: Cracking the Top Ten says a lot for a Franchise that is pushing to get its first A level type game, but at least we know that HER is trying to stretch its boundaries. Good Job and keep going!

I first encountered this while looking for good software for my coworkers to use to edit short web videos.  These are people, myself included, with regular office jobs who just need the ability to edit video one or two times a year and we keep one computer with graphics software for those occasional times when someone needs it.  We already has access to Adobe Primere, but it is far too busy an interface for someone who does not have a big amount of time to invest at the very beginning in learning how to use it,  In contrast, the Pinnacle Studio line of software has a good balance of having the tools to allow me to do lots of projects while still keeping the interface clean so that it is intuitive and easy to figure out how to do something.  If you want to do serious editing but haven't done much editing before, then this is a good product to get.  Most of the time when I know in my head what I want to do, it is easy to figure out how to do it or to search online and find instructions on how to do it,

Pinnacle makes three editing programs: Studio (in the 60 dollar range), Plus (in the 100 dollar range), and Ultimate (in the 130 dollar range).  The biggest difference is that Plus and Ultimate let you do screen capture as well as editing.  That's a nice feature.  Good basic scree casting software is a must for me.  Another difference that matters is that Ultimate has added features to clean up audio quality.  Other differences don't matter to me as a casual user.  For example, Plain old Studio not Ultimate not Plus only lets you work with 6 tracks at once, while Plus is 24 tracks and Ultimate is unlimited.  That limit doesn't bother me because I'm just doing short web videos and usually just deleting bloopers or doing a little audio clean up.  Pinnacle has a chart on their website comparing the software features.  The most compelling reason to get Ultimate is that that way if you google for instructions on how to do something in Pinnacle Studio, then those will definitely apply to something your product will do.

Overall this is a really great piece of software if you want to do some serious video editing but that is not your full time job.  I can do what I need to do to clean up short web videos, and the interface is intuitive so that it saves me time figuring out how to do what I plan to do.

Windows 7 righted the fiasco of Vista and hopefully by October of 2013 ""Windows Blue"" aka Windows 8.1 will right Windows 8 or Metro without additional charge.

What is good about Windows 8:

In one word: fast.

What is not so good about Windows 8:  (oh boy...)

1.  The Metro interface is a mess for use on a desktop! Touch screen and the Metro interface is fine for tablets and phones, but for a desktop, most people want ease of use and they just want it to work.  Perhaps for a touch screen all in one computer, it might be ok.  For a desktop with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor - Windows 8 is a nuisance.  For many users who are upgrading, it is unfriendly and downright unusable.  Unless you are a power user or someone who embraces new ideas quickly, Windows 8 in it's present format is probably not for you.

2.  Microsoft doesn't seem to understand the basics of customer loyalty.  It is a big mistake to take away something you gave in a previous O/S.  Microsoft's ill conceived plan to leave out Windows Media Center and try to charge extra for it in Windows 8 (after the initial limited time give-away) is a huge mistake.  There are indications this will be corrected in Windows 8.1 as well.  Let's hope so!

Now for the big question:  HOW CAN YOU FIX IT?

One way to overcome the Metro interface is to use a free and relatively simple program which restores the desktop interface.  You can research these products by reviews on PCWORLD magazine online.  (Like any other program, you use it at your own risk!)  I chose a program called CLASSIC SHELL by the open source people at Sourceforge.  I am not affiliated with them and I cannot make any statement as to its suitability for you or your computer.  However, they are the people who have developed the popular open source programs VLC and 7-Zip.  The program is working very well for me.

Anyway, if you upgraded or bought a new pc with Windows 8, don't panic!  Once you get the desktop interface back, it is a reasonably good and stable O/S. Hopefully Microsoft has heard the outcry of their customers and have seen the plummeting sales of Windows 8 and new computers and will restore the ability to boot to the desktop interface and restore Windows Media Center as part of the O/S as well.

Happy computing!

Update:  July 14, 2013.  Although the Windows 8.1 update will be free, I still cannot recommend Windows 8 or 8.1 for the following reasons.

First, let the user decide whether they want to have a desktop or a mobile pc experience.  This means fully restoring the desktop menu system rather than providing a semi-functional start button.

Second, Windows Media Center needs to be part of the operating system and not some very expensive extra cost add-on.  Home theater computers are very popular and a great way to enjoy movies and music.  Windows Media Center must be restored as a standard feature to Windows 8.

Unless Microsoft wakes up, the rate of adoption of Windows 8 will remain very low.  It is much easier to migrate your Windows 7 operating system to the new computer rather than put up with the cumbersome mess that is Windows 8.",An unfortunate misstep once again for Microsoft,1367625600,8,

Given the mass of ""instant satisfaction"" commercials on tv, it's easy to write this product off as another one of those scams to relieve people of their hard earned money.  It was sort of with this attitude that I approached Rosetta Stone.  I've had a mild interest in Japanese for some time and so, decided to take the plunge with the Japanese version of Rosetta Stone.

Rosetta Stone comes with the software for installation on a computer, audio cds for use to practice while on the go as well as a headset for use with the software itself. Installing the program is easy enough, and then one gets into the nitty gritty of using it. The program is fairly well laid out and intuitive and it's easy to get started.

As others have described, Rosetta Stone's main goal is to encourage users to speak the language actively.  Immersion is undoubtedly the most effective way to learn a language as it forces the speaker to use the language and converse in it under practical circumstances. As one who's taken a few language courses in my time, I can say that while book study has its uses, to actually learn a language for practical use, speaking and hearing it is absolutely vital.

Rosetta Stone attempts to get as close to that experiance as possible with its teaching style. Do do this, it uses images, spoke words and a return responce method. The user speaks into a microphone to respond and the program has the facility to ""listen"" to one's pronunciation and correct it when off.  For a tonal language such as Japanese, pronunciation is absolutely vital to avoid translation errors.

The Rosetta Stone method is quite effective in helping to train a person's mouth to make the correct sounds and get used to saying the words. Japanese is a language quite unlike English, so this is a real benefit of the program. I found that it really did work in helping me retain vocabulary, though I did struggle at times.  The progam is fairly well designed from a flow standpoint, with various lessons occasionally repeating themselves as you progress to help reinforce retention of the material.

In the end it's not a perfect method, but for the self studier, it isn't terrible.  The down side is that Rosetta stone uses a call responce method and so a person does not get the conversational experiance that builds confidence and teaches in its own right. Practical conversation is unexpected and fluid, something that a computer program cannot emulate. I could see that this program would be a godsend if used in conjunction with actual classes where one could practically apply what they've learned. Repeating rote phrases is a lot different than actually speaking.

Another thing I noticed is that Rosetta Stone's focus on speaking actually has a downside in that it seems a bit weak on teaching proper grammer. It uses the language method of teaching by showing differences in gender and verb conjugations and the like as you go through lessons, but it's not very deep and a lot of it is inferred. For someone like myself who has taken numerous language classes over the years, I was left wondering if learning vocabulary and grammer in this way was really enough. Given that all I know about Japanese is what I was taught by Rosetta Stone, it's hard for me to say.

The use of Japanese characters is another aspect of this program that threw me. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers here and studied some of the Hiragana on my own to avoid using Romaji (latinized written japanese). It was good advice.

A word to the wise, this is a pretty in depth program. While commercials and the like seem to imply that this is the ""easy"" way to learn a language, it's like any other method of learning a language. It's work and a real investment of time. Daily study will make this program its most effective and probably push a student deeper into the language than basic classes would.  But it's likely to take months rather than weeks to progress to the point where one has a deeper grasp of the language.

I didn't use the language CD's (which cover the lessons in the program), but I could see that if someone was in a hurry to learn even more quickly, these might be quite useful for usewhile in the car on the go.

From personal experiance, I learned more Japanese more quickly from this program in a couple months than a comparative spanish when taking a couple years of that language.  That's saying something.",The next best thing to immersion and classes,1234137600,,

Apart from the expected map updates, GPS navigation has been upgraded with text to speech capabilities. Unfortunately, it uses a raw Microsoft Anna speech engine, which sounds HORRIBLE. For example, instead of route ""US 51"" the software says ""us 51"" (as in the objective case of ""we""). Same thing with ""SR 51"": the program says ""senior 51"". The intonation is all wrong as well, making it extremely hard to understand (unlike dedicated GPS navigators). Microsoft Anna was never developed with route directions in mind, so I think that MS should have spent some time to adapt it for this software.

BUT, bad text to speech is better than no text to speech at all. For example, you CAN understand highway exit numbers, so if you frequent a lot of highways you'll find the text to speech useful.

Another nice little improvement is automatic rerouting. If you miss a turn from the route, you won't hear Anna repeat ""Off Route"" indefinitely (like in the old edition), but instead it will automatically recalculate a new route and supply you with the new directions. Extremely useful!

The interface has been improved to a certain extent as well. The buttons are now larger so it's easier to use while in a vehicle (of course, you still need to pull over when you need to make major changes, or when you want to find a point of interest).

And yes, you can use the old GPS receivers found in previous editions with absolutely no issues.

Also, the ability to create very high quality charts and graphs that seamlessly integrate with Power Point and Word is fantastic. I've been able to make nicer looking reports in less time than ever before. Excel is the biggest overall improvement from 2003 especially in the visual department. The addition of a wide variety of visual styles for reports is welcome and very useful.

Another great change to Excel is the detailed descriptions for each command that are available in the help section. There is still some streamlining that is missing; too much of the program is still dependent on old macro commands that no one but long time users of things like Lotus Notes have a vocabulary for.

Power Point is also a nice improvement. Adding images and then tweaking them is easier than ever. As I mentioned previously, taking charts and graphs from Excel to PP is very easy. You can use cut-and-paste, or import them directly. The resulting PP files are also smaller than the previous format, which is great for e-mailing them to people.

The much maligned DocX format was initially a real gaffe for Microsoft; not making it immediately usable by Office 2003 users was simply moronic. Although they've released several patches that do allow full implementation between 2003 and 2007 versions of Office, these updates are large (over 50mb) and while businesses most certainly have updated, it's far less likely that your friend, brother, etc., has. Sending a DocX file to those without the patch can create a bit of chaos.

This install was an upgrade from PP12 because it had been reinstalled too many times, causing blockage by Nuance.  I could have called them again but it was time to get the latest version.

I am a home user, who started with PagesPro then a Xerox product.  I like the product, particularly the image printing to PDF and the PDF editing features.  I use them regularly.

Unfortunately, with this edition, after a clean re-install of WIN7 Pro 64-bit the image printer driver refused to install -- the main program installed fine.  I called Nuance support, no 800 number available, was on hold forever and the best they could do was say try reinstalling with the firewall and anti-virus disabled.  That made no sense, the main program was installed and registered.

My  problem was with the printer driver install only.  There are a lot of us with that problem.  I read their posts.  I tried many workarounds with no meaningful help from Nuance.  Finally, I found a utility in the image printer driver's program folder for reinstalling the printer driver after an OS upgrade -  WORKED LIKE A CHAMP. To bad Nuance did not know enough to tell me to try it.

ALSO, there is a known bug in the standard version of PP14's update program.  It does not report any update!  There are many workarounds on the web for that as well, however, none worked for me.

Here's my review. .  . .. .

I have been using this product, off and on, for a little over a month now.  Here's my take on it. . . . If you are either a slow typist, or have a disability which does not allow you to type, then I think that this software is probably going to be helpful for you.  The box says that most people type no more than 40 words per minute.  I type over twice that.  I use this software when I want to send a letter to a friend.  I would not use this for business purposes.  You spend a lot of time correcting and ""training"" the system.  I find far fewer mistakes when I'm typing it myself than when I'm using this software.  But again, I type relatively fast.  Having spent a LOT of extra money to purchase the ""Preferred"" edition, I really wish I had stuck with the ""Standard"" edition.  Using it for Excel (not available on the Standard edition)  is cumbersome at best, and being that often times numbers are so important in spreadsheets, it's quite ""error prone"" and correcting a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet is not fun.  Again, I'm not really knocking the software.  I think it does a relatively good job overall, and I'm sure that if you take the time to make all of the corrections it gets better. .  .. but. . . I think if you type fast to begin with, you're probably not going to be too happy with this software.  Unless the above ""extras"" included in the Preferred edition are really worth a lot to you, I would recommend the Standard edition and save yourself some $$.

My major use of the suite is WordPerfect. I've been a WP user for over two decades, and I briefly trained people on the program in a large company in the late 1980s. There was a time when I was a power user but I am out of practice with some advanced features.

The below comments reflect Windows on a 64-bit system. Some of the problems (especially search) reflect Windows, not WP.

Good features of WP: Reveal codes. Much more control over tables than in MS-Word. Foreign character sets. Mathematical formulas still better than MS-Word, but the interface has gotten steadily worse over time. WP imports and exports MS-Word documents very well, but the reverse is not true.

Bad: Too many crashes. It doesn't remember your open files when crashes or if the system forces closure. Search didn't work until the latest Service Pack. I can't save user-defined page sizes with all of the attributes, but I have to reset each time. Over the years Corel has made the macro function worse. Not competitive with MS-Word on collaboration, such as ""comments"" and tracking changes.

Other items in the suite: QuattroPro and Excel are essentially interchangeable for an intermediate user such as myself; advanced users may distinguish the two.

Over the years, I've gotten used to using Presentations for designing graphics but I use PowerPoint for public presentations. I'm likely to keep that habit, as Presentations works better with WordPerfect, my primary word processor. However, I often give PowerPoints from someone else's computer, and it's easier to use the software of the Evil Empire in those cases.

They invest their all into a fine application - which this is - but the market is inherently limited to those who want to produce 3D renderings. There are many people who would love to do that, but it is a difficult undertaking.

 So the marketers claim it is an easy thing to do, that learning how to do it is simple. They laughed when I sat down to create a 3D rendering of a woodland nymph . . . and they were right.

 Creating 3D renderings isn't simple, though the folks who publish Poser try to make it easier with each new version. I own several of the earlier versions and, speaking generally, would give up in minutes.

 Poser 9 is an excellent product, but it has a fairly steep learning curve and possessing artistic talent is not optional, it is a requirement. They include a ton of content and the interface is usable. There are a couple of books about using Poser and picking up a used copy of one for an earlier version is a good investment.

 If you have the time, though, and the discipline to work through each step, you can master Poser 9.

 Personally, considering the low level of my skills, I prefer Reallusion iClone and Daz Studio: they're not necessarily as capable as Poser 9, but they are somewhat easier for novices to approach.

 But, as I said, if you can devote the time and energy to learning Poser 9 and practice, practice, practice, you can turn out truly exquisite work with this application. I just wish I could.

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",Great Array For The Price,1332720000,,

 On a recent trip, I was navigating. In a car moving at expressway speeds, the results in the search box were impossible to read because the type is so small. The address I was looking for is a house that was built in 1993. Neither it nor the surrounding community are to be found on the these maps.

 Such inaccuracies are unacceptable.

 For route planning, I would strongly suggest using Google Maps as your primary source or at least to check on the accuracy (or lack thereof) of the Microsoft products.

 Data mapping capability, on the other hand, is excellent. You can use "". . . an address, ZIP Code or postal code, census tract, city, metropolitan statistical area (MSA), state or province, or country. You can aggregate data by importing or linking data at one level (for example, ZIP Code) and displaying at a higher level (for example, State).

 Importing is a relatively smooth process and you can use Excel, Access, Outlook contacts or any of several text formats.

 You can create territories from data or manually. Pushpin styles are limited, compared to the last version, but you can add your own.

 Once the data is mapped, you can massage it in a variety of ways, including creating routes between multiple pushpins.

 Overall, I think both Microsoft mapping products have taken a step backwards from the most recent versions. Neither MapPoint 2009 nor Streets & Trips 2009 have any features compelling enough to make the upgrade and the maps appear to be the same. I'd hold off for the next version or consider competitive products. By all means, try out the Microsoft evaluation version before you purchase this product.

I have to admit that when it comes to running security software, I have never practiced what I preach.  For example, I installed antivirus software on my parents' computer years ago, but I almost never run it on mine.  Why?  Because I've grown tired of software that slows down my system, but my parents care less about performance, so it's not a big deal for them.

Without exception, over the past several years, every time I've attempted to put security software on my own computer (antivirus, firewall), the impact on system resources has been frustrating.  I think it's dangerous to be without such software, but every time I try, my system comes to a screeching halt.

So, after roughly another year of ""living on the edge"", I found a good price on Norton Internet Security 2012 and decided to give it another shot.  I was absolutely amazed at how unobtrusive their software has become!  NIS 2012 has actually changed my attitude about Symantec (a major culprit in the past in my battle to protect my computer's CPU and RAM).

Here's what I noticed:
+ Installation went very quickly!  I didn't time it, but I'm pretty sure the process took less than a minute.
+ Updates went very quickly!  It turns out that event though I bought this 2012 version, I was eligible to update to the 2013 version for free.  This process was simple and quick.
+ Though I know it is running in the background (and as an add-in for my Google Chrome browser), NIS 2012 (and 2013) has been barely noticeable.  I am able to go about my business-as-usual with no apparent issues from Norton.

About the only time I observe Norton doing its work is when I download a file over the internet.  Norton politely pops up, checks the file to see if its safe, and then disappears moments later when it is done checking.

So, as long as NIS continues to quietly protect my computer in the background, I plan to stick with it!",No longer a resource hog,1349136000,,

The old dates for updates and failed update file were not present in the version I downloaded.

All in all, this package is the gold standard for computer based will creation. It walks you through all the steps required to create a will, as well as document for health care directives, final arrangements and a basic letter to survivors. Of course, the documents are not of much use without getting notarized. Thankfully this is usually pretty simple (and cheap), and only involves going to a notary public with the documents, ID and 2 witnesses. You then all sign in front of the notary, then you can pick where to store it.

Storing the will you created is important - do not store it in a safe deposit box as it may be impossible to access after death. If you have an attorney, some may store it for you for a reasonable fee. There are also online services that do this. This package does come with a one year living trust, but only with one year of access to it. If all else fails, purchase a water and fire proof safe, and store it there. Make sure the important people noted in your will know where to find it in case of your death.

All in all, this package is well worth the money (now it works well) - it includes the online living trust (for 1 year), an online downloadable version of the Nolo basic law guide, the legal answers book for families (in the box, 222 pages) and updates to the software for one year. Like most Quicken products, this product will become obsolete on 12/31, which means you may need to buy a new version next year if you didn't finish this one on time.

Bottom line - if you don't have the money to get an attorney to make your will, and you don't have any overly complex situations (like major investments, multiple properties or complex distributions of your wealth), this package will suit all your needs - as long as you put a bit of effort into it as well.",Now updated to fix bugs - this package will serve all of your living will requirements - as long as you put some effort into it.,1424563200,12,
3121,3121,3.0,False,"10 10, 2008",AMUP8DYE7EAN2,B0013A5GGE,,mateo52,"In theory, 360 2.0 is a comprehensive all-in-one security package that frees the user from the need to remain cognizant of maintenance needs, especially if one has multiple PCs to be serviced, and for newer units with mid to upper range capability that is the case.

After months of ambivalence (and waiting for the supposed automatic offer), I decided to upgrade from version 1.0 to 2.0 on three computers: One desktop with 4 GB of memory with Vista Ultimate, a laptop with Vista home premium and 2GB memory, and an 8 yearold but highly reliable CPU with only 256MB memory. Version 1.0 ran adequately on the first two units and from all appearances this version 2.0 is not as resource intensive as the earlier version however, LiveUpdate remains an annoyance.

Similarly to version 1.0, it appears the only other Norton product that is compatible with 360 is Norton Ghost.

In the case of the older unit, performance of Norton 360  was consistently problematic so I was not surprised to encounter difficulties with the upgrade however I had no inkling of the extent of encumbrances I would face in what from a cursory view appeared to be a rather benign installation.

Like security suites offered by other vendors version 2.0 includes virus protection (unfortunately still updated via LiveUpdate whereas NIS 2009 is migrating to real time updating) firewall, spyware and intrusion protection, email scanning, parental controls and anti-spam filtering. The latter mentioned features are available as add-on packs accessible from Symantec's website. This version also enhances network monitoring capabilities and expands supported media for backups. Curiously, and incongruently, while network attached storage devices like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Netgear-RND2150-ReadyNAS-Duo-500-GB-Desktop-Network-Attached-Storage/dp/B0013G04AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Netgear RND2150 ReadyNAS Duo 500 GB Desktop Network Attached Storage</a>&nbsp;are discovered by network monitoring, automatic backup to the same device is not supported. It should also be noted the only qualitative difference I can see between the standard version and the premier version of 2.0 is the increased online secure backup storage of  10GB in the case of the premier edition. Standard edition availability is 2GB and in my opinion neither is sufficient. As an all in one product, some compromises in user control could be anticipated however it would have been an advantage if the user was offered the capability to backup individual files rather than continuing the limitation to classes of folders. Essentially, while backup to ipods is intriguing, I see little advantage to employing this backup facility over the functionality existent in both XP and Vista operating systems.

The network monitoring feature is beneficial but is flawed to the extent multiple devices connected to a single access point  like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NETGEAR-HD-Gaming-5-GHz-Wireless-N-Networking-Kit-WNHDEB111/dp/B00126R3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111)</a>&nbsp;are not individually distinguishable. Only the mac address of the access point is identified therefore from my primary computer I cannot fully monitor a second PC or my NAS.

This version also includes registry cleaning as a component of the PC tune-up facility and ""identity safe security"" of personal information like social security, bank account and credit card numbers. The phishing filter is an improvement over version 1.0 however it still lacks the comprehensiveness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Site-Advisor-Plus-2009-1-User/dp/B001EJQTUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Site Advisor Plus 2009 1-User</a>&nbsp;in as much as it does not offer advice search engine results. Significantly, the phishing filter does not work with Safari or Google chrome.

And then there was the upgrade on my older PC...

In spite of Norton's representations, I would not recommend installation on any PC that meets only minimum system requirements. At every step, I encountered difficulties that severely constrained the process and after 24 man hours devoted to installation the process is still incomplete.

First and foremost, upgrade is not automatic. Although 360 offers three PC licensing, I could not download the upgrade via my existing account. Only after email inquiry was I provided  an address that facilitated download to my second and third PCs. In the instance of my oldest unit I made the mistake of running the recommended system scan before installation. It occurred to me as well, this does not generate a great deal of confidence in Norton if in fact one is upgrading or replacing an existing Norton anti-virus program. I received a message indicating this version was incompatible with Windows Defender so I had to remove that program before proceeding. I did not pre-scan with the other two PCs and no compatibility issues were identified nor I have experienced any since the upgrade or have I ever encountered issues in the two years I used 360 version 1.0.

Although during install procedure on my first computer I was advised existing add-on packs should be backed up using another program that must be downloaded from the Norton site, the same message was not received for either of the later installs and the add-on pack itself appeared on my desktop upon completion of the preliminary stages, but I get ahead of myself. The install aborted three times because LiveUpdate was running in the background and could not be terminated even manually via msconfig or the task manager. When I finally managed to disable it, I later discovered another version initiated by Norton Ghost could not be removed, so I had to uninstall Ghost before proceeding. Degradation of system performance was clearly evident as at least five hard stops were required and in each case the difference in boot times was visually perceptible without Norton running. Eventually, the install was completed but start up would not progress past the call to explorer.exe which was visible but the desktop icons were never painted...another hard stop via task manager and restart.

Finally, the configuration wizard appeared and I was able to setup the program...only to discover Norton had identified un-removable cookies,an un-repairable virus and my virus definitions from version 1.0 had not updated via LiveUpdate for more than 8 months. Following program instructions to contact online support for more information, I reached site catch 22 as the more information could not be gleaned until I defined the problem inhibiting installation...After removing the cookies with spybot and determining the virus was most likely Norton Ghost LiveUpdate, and  running a new version of LiveUpdate for more than two hours to acquire all of the missed updates, I received an email from support advising I should download a software removal tool to wipe out any residue programs, which of course would also wipe out my latest install and render 14 hours of effort pointless.

So now, I have version 2.0 installed and running with significantly greater degradation than version 1.0 as it applies to response time for Explorer or Firefox so I'm using Safari as the default browser and it performs with blazing speed even on this under resourced box with Norton installed. Of course...my install of Microsoft Office suite has been damaged so I have time to type this on another computer while I wait for the re-install to finish...",The Dickensian install,1223596800,,

The easy editor does step you through the process and by adding the special effects you can have a very professional looking video. I also like the slide show option. I made several slide shows of book covers. The special effects, particularly the 3D give you very interesting effects. The one caution I have is to check how the special effects crop the pictures. My book covers have portrait orientation. The balloons option crops them as though they were landscape which made the book covers unreadable. However, there are plenty of other choices.

Much as I like the software and will keep using it, there were some problems. The manual is difficult to use. It reminds me of my camera manuals which take a bit of study. This is fine for the advanced effects, but I think an instructional video for beginners would be a help. There are excellent instructional videos for the advanced effects, particularly 3D, on the website.

The other problem I had is that the software locks up a lot. You can cure it by shutting down the computer but that gets frustrating after awhile. I also had trouble consistently loading my videos into the editor. To be fair, this may be due to the way my videos are stored. My camera is the Canon HR10, which stores the video on small discs. Sometimes I could load a file perfectly. The next time, the same file wouldn't load.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

I choose deactivate quite a few since many of them (i.e. email protection) was not needed as I do not do these activities over the system.  I simply wanted some antivirus protection against trojans that can attach themselves to the system unknowingly.  The menus were relatively straightforward to figure out how to select things without having to refer to another source.  This is as a brief summary appears below the screen when you point your mouse to a selection box.  Nice.  I particularly enjoyed the option of disabling the splashscreens and any update/news notices.  This is important because when my system reboots automatically those kinds of splash screens can screw up my boot process which has a complex set of scripts that are timing-dependent.

CPU usage is a major consideration with any antivirus program so that was a concern to me.  Although my server doesn't max out its cpu use, I have done a lot to minimize electricity consumption of the system.  Wasted cpu cycles increase power requirements so I do not want wasteful software running all the time.  This is particularly an issue as my system processes several dozen files in batches every minute of the day for its tasks.  With active virus scanning enabled, these files are analyzed for viral activity.  When no file activity is conducted, it seems that the antivirus system consumes an average of only 1-2% cpu power.  With active scanning going on during the batch processes that occur, cpu usage climbs up to 6-13% for a few seconds.  This isn't too bad really, and acceptable (so far) to me.

As for updating the definition files, they were pretty quick to download, no complaints there.  The registry key is good for 3 computers for 2 years.  Although some may be dismayed at the 2-year figure, I am quite impressed that the company is honest about this.  Some other company's don't mention it at all and you may think it's an infinite lifetime license, but in reality it doesn't work that way as they will obsolete your license when a major version changes in the software.  Bitdefender deserves credit for their honesty.

Overall, it looks like I'll be keeping this antivirus program on.  I will knock off one point due to the install issues highlighted earlier.  They really need to let the user select the ability to disable the firewall during the install as many will install the software remotely.","Overall good product, had some install issues",1227139200,,

This version of Sage 50 (formerly Peachtree Accounting software) is their easiest to use yet with the best interface they have ever offered.

Some background: In case you don't know, Peachtree/Sage 50 has been the 2nd place accounting software for quite sometime now.  It has always been more complete than Quickbooks but not as easy to use nor as ""linked/connected"" to other items. In the old days if you showed 10 normal small business owners both products, after 5 minutes of playing around with both 9 out of 10 would select Quickbooks. (And normally that last person would have had more of an accounting background so easy to use wasn't as important.)

Quickbooks figured this out and started charging more, creating products that would basically expire and selling features that should be included for extra. Peachtree/Sage 50 kept on chugging away and enjoying their 10% until Sage decided to really work on ease of use and the clunky interface. Ever since then, Sage 50 has been slowing gaining customers and converting Quickbooks users. I love it when the underdog starts giving the pretty boy a run for his money!

Sadly, for me, I am still a Quickbooks user. Why you ask? Two reasons Costco and Quickbooks online. While it is now more expensive, for a while you could sign up for Quickbooks Online (which also includes automatic payroll functions) for $6.99 per month. To this date, that is what we still use because it is cheaper than purchasing payroll functions for Sage 50 or Quickbooks and our business needs are very simple. It is also hard to compete with the ability to pull up our account from any computer to work on payroll.

But if I was using a PC based product, it would be Sage 50 Pro without a doubt.

I have been running Norton products for many years, and they all work seamlessly, and the latest versions are even more outstanding than the previous, so I figured that this would follow suit.

Not so, at least for me.

At first, I tried to backup my basic photos, but realized that 25 gB doesn't go very far when you have a decade of photos to save.  (I have 90 gB!)  So, I decided to back up my documents...

When I ran it, it conflicted with my Norton Antivirus, and I had to call Norton Customer Support.  They walked me through a process where I had to delete one of my computer's backup through the Antivirus program to make it work.  I was told that I could just re-add it later and run a complete back up...this computer is my boyfriend's, and doesn't have a tremendous amount of data, so I didn't worry about that...

They walked me through the process of setting up the back up, but even with their help, it didn't work.  The could not figure out what the problem was, either.  It shows that I have ""increased"" backup through the Norton 360, but it's not accessible.  Crazy.

Top that off--we cannot get the deleted computer back onto the system where it backs up his data.  The Antivirus is still there, but it refuses to complete a back up.  NO clue why.  Customer Service doesn't know, either.

The interoperability with Office 2003 and 2007 alone makes it higher than that.  After all, people who get Office 2008 are commonly those who have used the Windows version of Office and need to continue working with those files.  Say what you will about iWork, it's not perfect in that arena.  When dealing with school work and business assignments that call for these features, it's just not acceptable to deal with anything but the best, and in those arenas, Office reigns supreme.

A lot of this is based on my personal experience.  It really boils down to four things.

OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY SLOW.  I don't even mean slightly laggy.  I mean SLOW.  TO the point you wonder if anyone did any QA on it before releasing it.  They're not even bloated apps either, not even Entourage, so it's boggling as to why the apps are as slow as they are.  Excel is by far the worst offender in the bunch.

OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY BUGGY.  I speak more to Word and Excel than Powerpoint or Entourage.  Excel is known to lock up after a fashion.  Word has frozen on me on more than one occasion, the latest being right at the closing stages of a book I'd written (obviously unacceptable).

OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY CONVOLUTED.  If you've used 2003, you know it's a matter of memorizing toolbar and menu positions.  If you've used 2007 you know it's getting familiar with the Ribbon, mostly.  2008, I don't know what they were thinking.  The Toolbox just takes all of the needed features and bulks them under a clunky structure that makes it difficult to get to the simplest of tasks.  I know they plan to fix this with 2011, and I certainly hope they take note of what they did with 2007 and 2010, because 2008 feels archaic even now.

OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.  Given it doesn't include a full flavor of Outlook, and how clunky, buggy, and slow it really is, and given the fact that iWork is significantly lower, it's confusing to me why Microsoft feels the need to price this so high.

IN summary, I recommend it for its interoperability, but ONLY if you need that.  If you're just trying to compile docs for school and your own files, choose iWork instead.  The only thing you lose is mail, but the built in Mail app is more than enough for the majority of applications.

Initially I had some difficulties with the program - first, it would take a very long time (upwards of 20 minutes!) to launch, and the program had real problems with Font menus. A few simple tweaks to Word, and to my font management software solved these issues. Now all my Office:Mac 2008 applications open swiftly and work smoothly.
A problem I had with the 2004 version of Word in particular was that there was a slight lag between keystroke and monitor update, so my typing was always a few words ahead of what was visible on my screen. With the '08 version, this has gone away.
If there is a flaw in the program, it would actually have to be that the new Mac-like interface has changed where tools and features are located, so I find myself having to learn my way around the program all over again. I hate to say it but I miss the old menu and toolbar structure.

Both worked well at times over the years, but the latest versions of both have been problematic for me. Norton has become a resource hog and the version of McAfee I tried a year ago would work for a day or two before the service would completely stop. The only resolution was to uninstall and reinstall McAfee.

I finally moved to Microsofts free Forefront Security that installs through Windows Update and that worked well, but I wanted a more robust, complete solution.

Id heard good things about Kaspersky, but had never before tried it. Nearly a month ago, I obtained the Kaspersky Internet Security Multi Device. That package came with a five user license that allowed me to install it on my laptop PC with Windows 7 x64, my desktop PC with Windows 7 x64, my Kindle Fire HD, ny Android phone running version 4.1.2 (Jellybean) and my Android phone running version 4.3 (also Jellybean.) With each device, the installation was quick and easy.

The software package came with a CD for Windows users and another for Mac users. I do not have any iOS devices, so I cannot rate its effectiveness with those systems. The Windows CD contained the Kaspersky software for Windows and provided links to the Google Play store so you can easily install the software on your Android devices.

One of the main reasons I wanted Kaspersky is because I need a solution that handles spam email when it is delivered to my Outlook client. Even the newest version of Outlook (2013) doesnt do a very good job of trapping spam email even on its most aggressive setting.

The first thing I noticed when I started using Kaspersky Antispam with Outlook is it began searching all of my existing Outlook folders for spam email that had come in long ago. I LOVE that. When I saw it doing that, I almost jumped for joy. Id been trying to tackle these older spam emails in my inbox when I found time but it is a neverending task. The idea that all I had to do is sit back and let Kaspersky handle all of that work for me absolutely made my day. All I had to do was retrieve the occasional email trapped erroneously, training Kaspersky on what I wanted to keep. Easy enough  especially when you can import a list of email addresses you want to mark as safe senders. All of this is great  in theory. The problem is that as my safe senders list grew in Kaspersky, Outlook started crashing. Within days, I was at a point where Outlook would crash as soon as it had loaded. I removed all of the safe senders from my Kaspersky Antispam configuration, but no luck. I finally disabled Antispam and had to perform a repair install of Outlook on both PCs that Id used Kasperskys Antispam on and was once again able to use Outlook.

Once I disabled Antispam, Kaspersky worked well on both of my Windows PCs. Ive not had any problem with it on any of my Android devices.

I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with Kasperskys Internet Security software simply because without the Antispam feature, I might as well move back to the free Microsoft Forefront Security software. I probably won't do that until the subscription on Kaspersky expires unless it begins experiencing issues, but at this point I don't see any need to pay to extend the subscription next year if the tool doesnt provide the full functionality I need.

Kaspersky is certainly much more reliable than McAfee is and it doesnt hog the system resources on my PC like Norton does, but given its failure with Antispam and Outlook, I cant rate it more than three stars. If I were rating just the antivirus tool, I would give it five stars, but the Antispam feature deserves only one star.

I have been a devoted Intuit ""Quicken"" user since the DOS days of the program way back in the early `80's.  I have strayed a few times--once with Microsoft Money, and another time with a program whose name now escapes me, it was so long ago.  In the end I have always come back to ""Quicken,"" a program I consider the best personal financial program on the market.  I like ""Quicken"" because it allows me to seamlessly track all of my checking and savings accounts, (almost all) investments, and home inventory in one modular, easy to use package.  And I use Quicken to bank on-line, an added convenience that has made check-writing, bill paying, and account reconciliation so much easier.

The last time I upgraded Quicken was in at the end of 2009; that is when I updated to Quicken Premiere 2009.  I did so because Quicken 2005 was becoming buggy, and rather than re-install the program I decide to upgrade.  Also, I never like to be more then two versions behind, and; finally I hoped there would finally be an easy way to track U.S. Saving Bonds within the program; better luck next upgrade.  And oh, yes, one last reason: I got the software fro free through work.

I decide to go with ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" this time around because employees of the company I work for are allowed to download the software from Intuit for free, and because my version was becoming dated.

Installation

If you have a previous version of Quicken on your computer, the installation process will remove it completely, so be forewarned; i.e. back up your Quicken data to a separate directory before you start the install process.  There is a caveat however, one can use keyboard shortcut keys to install the new version along-side the old version and operate both at the same time.  I do not keep my Quicken data in the same directory as the program files, so this was not a concern for me.  And I always back up my Quicken data after each session.

At the end of the install, the program prompts you to upgrade the just installed software, and if you have internet access, I recommend you do so.  After the upgrade I started ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" for the first time, at which point I had the option to either start a new file or convert an existing one; I choose the later.  My Quicken 2009 data file was converted seamlessly by ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" without the slightest bit of trouble, for which I will be eternally grateful.

First Impressions:

As I stated at the outset of this review, I track all of my finances through Quicken; i.e. checking, savings, 401(K), investments, Saving Bonds (I have to improvise, there is no way to directly track Bonds in Quicken), loans, etc., as well as a household inventory via the Quicken Home Inventory module included in the program.  Some of my accounts are electronic and this feature still works well under ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" although one of my major bank accounts still cannot download transactions automatically.

One of the first things you'll notice is the new desktop home page.  The lines have been softened, and there is a new logical flow that is easy on the eyes.  My accounts are laid out on the left hand pane divided into account types.  The account can be re-arranged to suit you individual tastes.  But really there is not much difference between this and the previous version of the software.

Intuit brings back the Projected Cash Flow under the ""Spending"" tab at the top of the screen underneath the menu bar.  Quicken uses this area to give you a snapshot of money coming in verse money going out, by automatically tracking deposits from all accounts and bills.  I pay little attention to the area; it is nice to look at but I find its use limited.  Below this area there are a further three tabs entitled Scheduled Bills & Deposits, Account Balance Graph, and Spending Graph.  Again I see very little practical use for any of the areas, but they can be customized.

Other tabs across the top of the screen include: Bills, Planning, Investing and Property & Debt.  Again, I found little useful information underneath these tabs, but they are colorful and if you have a 401(k) the Investment tab might find some use.

With ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" you can set-up several account types, which the program divides up into four categories: Spending which encompasses the following account types: Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts, Credit Cards, and Cash; Investments: Brokerage, IRA or Keogh Plan, 401(k) or 403(b), and 529 Plan; Property: House, Vehicle, and Other Assets, and; Debt: Loan and Other Liability (not a credit card).

Each account can be associated with a bank or banking institution and the usually account information added; e.g. account number, opening balance, bank website, interest rates, etc.

One-Step Update

Almost everything I do in Quicken involves the On-line Center (replaced by One-step Update in Quicken Premiere 2011).  Via the One-Step Update I can gain access to most of my banking and investment accounts from which I can download transactions in one step.  Once the accounts are set up, the account information is saved to the Pin Vault and thereafter I can download my most recent transaction into my account registers.  Once downloaded the transactions can either be accepted all at once or one by one.  This beats keeping a written register!

Conclusion

Is there a compelling reason to upgrade to ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" from previous versions of the software?  Not really, unless you need the specific functionality the software brings to the table.  There have been slight improvements to the interface and a few new features associated with business use, but overall the program is unchanged.  The minor changes hardly justify the steep upgrade price of $64.99 (Amazon.com price).

And where is my support for bonds, bonds, bonds?  Surely I am not the only one who buys and tracks bonds.  Bond, be they U.S. Treasury Department Saving Bonds, Treasury Bills, Municipal Savings Bonds, or Corporate Bonds, as an important part of any diversified investment portfolio.  Get it together Intuit!

Despite the continued lack of support for Bonds, ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" is still the way to go if you want to simplify your (personal) financial life without a lot of fuss.

It does have one nasty nasty feature...and that is Symantec's insistence in forcing a subscription renewal at the end of one year. The cost of renewal is ridiculously high, and the sudden loss of protection if action is not taken is unconscionable. Personally, I solved that problem when my subscription to NIS 2008 expired in March. I simply switched to the McAfee program offered free by my Internet provider UNTIL Symantec offered one of its frequent rebate programs, which allowed me to purchase NIS 2009 in May for a net cost of $[...].

It ticks me off that the scum prowling the Internet ruin it for the rest of us by making it absolutely essential to purchase protection.

This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drews arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbors past and making friends with a local legend.
Besides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour.
 Danger on Deception Island is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.
As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average.

To an outside viewer any foreign language can seem like a perplexing challenge to take on. It usually requires regiments of classes and years of complex study. When Rosetta Stone advertized itself as being able to teach foreign languages in an easy, concise manner, I was very skeptical. Now that I've spent a few months using this software in the small gaps that open up during my busy schedule, my skepticism has completely dissolved.

While I can't claim to have gained mastery of the Japanese language, I can say that I've learned quite a lot by utilizing this outstanding software. The program allows the user to work with a headset, in which you speak various words and sayings into a microphone. Feedback is given on how well you pronouce these words and compared alongside the audio samples of native speakers. The visual techniques employed by the software is also very effective; the mind is immersed in a catalog of recognizable images that methodically builds up a network of associations and helps to gently increase your powers of memory.

While most study involved in Foreign Languages can be ardous and painful, Rosetta Stone somehow manages to turn the ordeal into a pleasent experience. The program is very user-friendly without being overly patronizing, and it ran very smoothly on my system without any sort of technical problems. I was honestly expecting some sort of technical hiccup due to the complex nature of the programming, but one never presented itself.

But perhaps the greatest aspect of Rosetta Stone is it's casual-though-effective structure to teaching. I found that simply using the program for just an hour a day proved to show progress, with most lessons taking 30 minutes or less to complete. It doesn't force its users to dedicate large portions of their life time in order to make progress. The way the lessons are timed and structured, one could come closer to understanding a foreign language while still maintaining a full and busy life with career, friends, and family.

Overall, I found Rosetta Stone to an effective tool in learning Japanese. I've only had the time to get through level 1 of the course, but I'm already inching my way closer to speaking and writing the alphabets of Japanese, without sacrificing any time from my normal schedule. It is highly recommended to everyone.",Advanced yet gentle learning experience,1219190400,,

As far as I have been able to determine, no self-respecting techie will touch this programme with a ten foot pole, but it does have its uses as a self-updating cure-all for small home systems.

The thing is, Microsoft has enemies, and due to the dedication of this group, the company has developed its own security system to protect customers against viruses, Trojans, spyware, phishing and all the other bad stuff coming at you through the internet.

Live Onecare is actually a combination of lots of stuff that's already on your computer, plus a spyware detector and a firewall, all nicely set up in an idiot-proof interface. Basically, it's a simple way of protecting your computer and keeping junk off your hard drive, now in a self-cleaning and self-updating model.

Pros:
1. If you're not familiar with your computer's system tools, this programme makes things like Disk Defrag, Disk Clean-up and Backup easier to find.
2. Automatically updates once you're connected to the internet
3. Can be installed on three computers with one Windows Live ID
4. Works as your own personal IT Department, fixing some problems before you know that they're there.

Cons:
1. Seeing that this is a Microsoft programme that repackages and organizes existing Microsoft software to help Microsoft customers with Microsoft problems, it should be available as a free download for those who need it.  The annual charge is nothing short of super-highway robbery.
2. Existing anti-virus and firewall programmes have to be removed before installation.
3. It doesn't pick up new viruses as fast as other programmes like McAfee and Symantec
4. It doesn't protect network servers, if you happen to have one at home, that is.
5. No anti-spam protection
6. The plastic packaging is like a firewall, resisting entry by intruders like yourself.

Conclusion:
1. If you're a techie you don't need this

2. If you're not a techie:
a. Ask someone to show you the Accessories - System tools menu
b. Keep your existing anti-virus software up to date
c. Don't download files attached to e-mails from untrustworthy sources (strangers aren't sending you greeting cards, and Jessica Biel probably isn't really nekkid either)
d. Stop frequenting those adult sites
e. Do all of the above and you don't need this.

3. If you're really not into computers and you just use yours for e-mail, writing letters, and shopping at Amazon, you might find this programme useful as a one-stop hassle-free service center.

This time, however, I upgraded from Quicken 2012 Premier to Quicken 2013 Deluxe, primarily to use the new Quicken iPhone app. (I settled for Deluxe rather than Premier because I haven't found myself needing the extra features of Premier.)

Like last year, the upgrade and registration was easy and mostly automatic. It noticed and removed my previous version, and restored its data, saving a safety copy as it upgraded the data format for 2013. I also had no trouble setting up a new cloud account for use with the iPhone app. However, I did trigger an error message (org.hibernate.exception. LockAcquisitionException : An unexpected exception occurred.) when I asked to also have my budget synced to the cloud. So far as I can tell, the error was harmless, as I still see budget info on my iPhone 4 that matches what I see in the desktop app in Windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit.)

The mobile app shows the accounts I've chosen to sync with the cloud, some of which also automatically update themselves with the associated financial institution, and others of which are intentionally not set up to talk directly to their associated financial institution. (I particularly appreciate the latter group, as it's my impression that Quicken's Mint Web site only works with accounts that can be linked with the associated institution, and some of mine cannot be so linked.)

The mobile app gives me a quick overview of my current situation, both overall and in relation to my budget (which it automatically updates as my spending changes.) It also shows me the alerts I've selected, such as when spending in a particular category exceeds its budget by a specified amount, or when I'm charged a bank fee of $1 or more. (I wish there were an option to show bank fees above a penny, as I try very hard never to incur such fees.)

Overall, two hours into using the new version, I'm happy to have upgraded, and will update this later if I notice any thing else important about the new version. [Update: Still no further problems after another week of use. A Quicken survey this week asked me to check the accuracy of my Quicken Mobile data, and it even correctly caught that I'd incorrectly-entered the associated account of a recent check in my Windows version of Quicken. Be sure you are fully updated (to R6 at the moment), as that may be why my experience has been more successful than that of some earlier reviewers.]

This is the third of four programs (each offering something more) offered by Norton to protect computers. There is Norton Antivirus, Norton Internet Security, Norton 360 and Norton 360 Multi-Deivice.  Norton 360 Multi-Device allows you to add protection to smart phones and tablets as well as computers. Norton also has a line of mobile and tablet security.

Once you purchase this you get a one year subscription. After the year is up you can either buy another year of service from Norton or buy the product from a third party like Amazon. In my case I was given the opportunity to review this for free through the Vine program so jumped at the chance to do so.

One of the nice features with Norton is that once installed it will always update to the latest version of the software you purchased. As a result of this there is no pressure to try the new and improved version because you are getting the newest version of the software you purchased.

When you press the Norton icon you get a screen that has security, identity, backup and tuneup options.  Each option gives you a number of choices such as when to run scans or updates or how to manage identity protection. It is easy to use and ideal for people who are not computer experts.

Norton Safe Search will also appear when I search the Internet.  There is a search box and if you go through it Norton will let you know if a site is safe or not.

One of the things I like about Norton is there is 24 hour live free technical support available for issues with installation or product use in general. I had an issue this year that may have been virus related and I called technical support. The agent addressed my concern and thankfully it was not a virus issue.

Over the past year I have had a couple of warnings that a virus had been blocked.  I have yet to have a virus problem in the years I have been using Norton products.

When you buy a Norton product you get 365 days of updates to keep your computer protected from the latest spyware and virus threats.  I had four months of my subscription left and a Norton agent was able to add that to the year that came with this product.

When I first started using Norton many years ago I would use additional programs for added protection against spyware. I just use Norton now. I am confident that it will protect my computer from virus or spyware issues. Additionally when scans are running I can still work on my computer without everything slowing down.

I have used Norton Internet security, and then Norton 360 for years; it has served me very well. the 360 is very comprehensive as an antivirus and Network plus a password manager. It also has a feature when you do a search, for instance, to see which sites are safe, and which are known to be malicious, and shown with a green (safe) or Red (danger) icon next to the link.

 The upgrade procedure is a nightmare if you are trying to install it on to your PC as an upgrade, especially if you want to carry over remaining days from your current subscription of the regular Norton 360. quite a few reviewers here have complained about the same issue. The Amazon download purchase of this product gives you a link to Symantec's website, where you enter your logon credentials, and the registration Key into the form. So far, no problem. The norton downloader installs, which then downoads the Norton 360 Premiere install file. When it is done, it says it is complete, and you are given the option to activate it, which again askes you for your registation key. When you enter it, it gives you an error that it is for the incorrect product. Everybody has complained on this, and I thought I would be more successful, lol.
You wind up closing the window, and looking at your current Norton 360, and see no change, so you click on the upgrade link, where you can enter the reg key: same error. You look into the folder where the downoad went into (Premiere NEVER DID install) and double click the file, which then actually does something and tells you that it needs to first uninstall the old 360, and also gives your the very wise opportunity to save your user settings, like your password vault first. you reboot your PC, and all you wind up with is (No new Norton 360 Premiere), a little icon in the taskbar for the password vault. So you install it again from the downloaded install file and it is successful, and asks for the reg key once more.

Now, how do you get your remaining days back from your ""old"" subscription? You go on Norton's web site and finally find out how to start a Chat session, enter your info, and get put into the Chat que. I was number 104 in line to start. It took about 45 minutes to get a rep on the chat session.  I actually put this paragraph in the wrong place..  Before I even went to start the download and upgrade, I went to Chat first to be told the correct procedure, and the rep only said that before he can carry over the remaining days, I must first install and activate the Premiere product. He actually never told me HOW to do the above correctly.
He also gave me a case number to use after I activated the new product, so I could continue afterwards and get the days transferred. I did that this morning, and it took another 40 minutes to go from #44 in the que to chat with a rep. He got it done for me no problem.

As a photographer, I like to use photo editors for more than fixing the photo problemscropping, sharpening, adjusting hue, etc. If you primarily want to adjust your photosfixing them as photos including adding some color enhancements--there are several other very good, much less expensive programs like Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop Elements that do that.

This is a pretty expensive program and I wouldnt get it unless I felt it did something that I couldn't do less expensively elsewhere (or couldn't do at all elsewhere) or unless it made something much easier to do than a less expensive program did.

Painter 2016 doesnt make thing easierthe interface isn't horrible and the tutorials are goodbut it is not all that intuitive and takes a little patience. (I also found some of the Youtube videos helpful). If youve used Photoshop, etc. youll see a lot of the same concepts herethe layout of the workspace, the toolbox, palettes, brushes. You can use layers and adding one is just as easy as clicking New layer.
What I like is taking a photo and using it to make something that is less like a photo and more like a painting (obviously those who start from scratch can use the tools to create a drawing or painting from scratch. The dpi is good.) The cloning tool and tracing features are very useful. It will do underpainting for you automatically. You can choose the texture of your paper and between all the things youd expecta watercolor effect, pastel effect, charcoal, etc. Choosing the right brush is a big thing in Painter, but it isn't that hard to get used to.  In addition to the texture of your paper, you can control the brightness of it and  adjust the texture to customize it for your own needs. It was good for landscapes,  okay for portraits. There are some special effects filters, wood cut, kaleidoscope, glass distortion, and so onnot useful for me, but someone may like it.

If you want to make art, particularly from a photo, this is a good program for it. I found the graphic capabilities able to add the kind of artistic details that made the end product look more like something that had started out as a painting done from scratch rather than a digitally enhanced photo. If you understand what that means and want to do it with your photos (and have the time to do it--it's not like applying a filter, it's like actually making a work of art), you would probably enjoy this very much.

First, DVD burning.  Toast allows you to import all sorts of video files, and burn them onto a video DVD, for viewing in your set-top DVD player.  This is a great feature, if you have some Divx video files, on your hard drive.  Drag them into the video folder in toast, and burn a video DVD.

Furthermore, do you have some un-encrypted DVDs, perhaps ones made in your set-top DVD recorder with video camera footage of your family?  With toast, you can import titles from those unencrypted DVDs, and put them onto a DVD, with fun and easy to navigate menus.

New to Toast 7 is a great new feature that allows you to compress an unencrypted video DVD image into a size that will fit onto a single-layer disk.  This basically gives you the functionality of popcorn built right into Toast 7.

Data Backup - Toast works fantastic as a backup utility.  There is even an application included to schedule backups on a regular basis.  Toast 7 allows for disk-spanning backups, which allows you to backup many gigabytes of data over multiple DVDs or CDs.

Audio - Toast 7 will obviously allow you to burn music CDs, but you can also burn a DVD.  The DVD will load on a set-top DVD player, with menus, to select music, and a shuffle feature.  You can get gigabytes of music onto these disks, and then play them in your DVD player.

Pictures - Toast 7 includes an application called Motion Pictures HD, which allows the importing of photos to make great slideshows.  They can be in beautiful widescreen, or even high-definition, if you make a Divx DVD (note that Divx DVDs can only be played in special DVD players).

Import Analog Audio - CD Spin Doctor is included with Toast 7, so you can easily import analog audio via your computer's audio input.  You might input audio, from a VHS tape, cassette tape, or record.

Discus RE - Discus RE is a simple, but convenient way to create labels, for your DVDs.  It includes the templates, for dozens of the most popular DVD labels, so then all you have to do is design your label and print it.  Easy.

Its time to coin a new term for programs like McAfee Total Protection. My complaints against the program are only partially related to its ability to filter out viruses and keep a computer free of junk.

The real issue with this program, and many, many others is that it will constantly steal the users focus by popping up text boxes from the Taskbar in Windows. These can come at ANY time the computer is on. They alert the user to the fact that ""McAfee has installed updates,"" or ""It is time to restart the computer"" to the neverendingly frustrating ""Your subscription is about to expire."" These boxes can and will pop up while immersed in a full screen computer game, at times causing it to crash. They will pop up when you are working on editing digital photos, or watching a movie, or anything else that requires your full attention.

The term ""nagware,"" came to mind, and maybe it will stick. Feel free to put your suggestions in the comments section of this review.

I understand why they do this. It is intended for novice computer owners who need to be reminded of all of these things, and who don't consider having their 'focus' (the primary task the computer user is working on. For example, as I write this review, it is my primary focus) stolen as EXTREMELY frustrating. That wouldn't even be a big deal, except that McAfee in their infinite wisdom has provided no remedy for the power user. We cannot turn off these irritating messages. They come regardless of my desire to see them or not.

They are amazingly irritating, especially if they disrupt something immersive, like a computer game or movie. Imagine: you are watching your new blue-ray of ""The Dark Knight,"" and just as Batman is about to dispense with the Joker, a text box pops up with the message ""McAfee has finished installing updates"" in a gray box in the corner of the screen. Unacceptable in the first place, and even more so because you CANNOT TURN THIS FEATURE OFF! This gets unbearable when your subscription is a few months from expiring, and alerts informing you of that pop up literally every time you use the computer. Also, they don't just leave after they pop up, the user is required to click 'ok.' You cannot permanently disable these messages.

As a virus scanner, McAfee works relatively well. It will scan your system for viruses, and if your definitions are up-to-date, find them some of the time. However, it is pretty strange that after making virus software for so many years, they still cannot provide a reasonably well working Spyware hunter that is anywhere near as good as the free version of ""Ad-Aware"" offered by Lavasoft, or the retail version of ""Spybot Search and Destroy.""

Another major complaint is the sheer size of the system resource footprint that McAfee total protection takes up. If you have an older computer, less than 2gb of ram (4gb with Vista), this program will create a very noticeable slowdown in your computer's performance. Comparing to how it runs on my wife's laptop with 4gb of ram vs. some of the computers at my work with only 1.5gb, the older work computers are drastically slowed down by McAfee, while my wife's laptop with its 4gb of ram is not really affected. (I do not use this program on my computer for the reasons that I've laid out above).

In concussion, if you don't care about 1. Annoying pop ups that steal your focus and cannot be disabled, 2. Very limited spyware removal and 3. Slow and poorly written code that uses a large portion of system resources, you MIGHT consider buying this software.","Nagware: focus stealing, average quality virus protection.

First, as other reviewers have mentioned, you're required to install this program on your boot drive. I have multiple drives which I use for my main drive, app drive, games, etc. Forcing me to install on my boot drive is ridiculous and limiting. I contacted support and this was confirmed...

I normally use CyberLink PowerDirector for my video editing, which, for the most part, has been fine for my needs. Pinnacle Studio's interface is very familiar coming from PowerDirector, so I was able to get editing pretty quickly. I immediately noticed that various features seemed more cumbersome to access. Outside of simply dragging and dropping video clips, it seems all other features require one or two extra clicks compared to PowerDirector, which I found slowed me down considerably.

My biggest complaint would have to be the stability... on the very first project, I spent about 15 minutes putting a video together (about 12gb), saved it, then tried to render it only to have the program crash. I restarted my computer, opened Pinnacle Studio back up, reloaded my project, and again, once I tried rendering, it crashed. I was able to render it only after starting from scratch and doing the exact same thing...

Since then, it's crashed quite a few times, to my frustration, since the crashes seem to corrupt the project I'm working on. I tried using the on my wife's laptop, with the same results.

The Macintosh has always meant simplicity, ease of use, powerful utility and just plain fun. Panther continues the tradition and enhances the experience.
Should you upgrade? Panther works for all G4 & G5 based Macs and MANY G3 systems. (PowerBook G3 Wallstreet and original PowerBook G3, G3 Beige and some other G3 systems are excluded from the supported systems list.) Essentially any G3 or higher Mac with built-in USB is supposedly supported. Panther has proven to be extremely stable. If you have a G5, Panther is almost essential to keep you up-to-date with all the hardware features and fixes becoming available.
If you have a G4, you PROBABLY want to get the upgrade to be sure to get the latest enhancements and fixes. Many of the graphical improvements require high-end graphic cards to see the benefit, though.
If you have a G3, first check to be sure your system is supported. Go to the Apple.com web page and select the ""Mac OS X"" tab. Then click on the ""Upgrade"" tab then select the link for ""Check the system requirements"". If your system passes muster, you may want to consider Panther because of the latest updates. You probably won't notice too many speed improvements or enhanced graphics capabilities. However, since it is a stable upgrade and has a number of useful new features it is worth considering.
If you have Internet access, getting updates is as simple as launching ""Software Updates"" from the Apple menu. There are many new features, outlined in the Amazon review and detailed at the Apple web site, ""Mac OS X"" tab, ""New Features"" tab.
For me, my favorite new features are Expos and Fast User Switching. With Expos, hit one function key and all your open windows slide aside so you can see your desktop. Hit a different key and all windows are visble, in miniature and aligned. Click on one of them and it pops to the top of the heap.
Fast user switching allows two (or more) separate users to use the same Mac at the same time. Each gets his/her own desktop and preferences. Select a user name from a new users menu at the top, right of the menu bar and enter that user's password and poof, your desktop becomes the other user's desktop.

I don't believe the hype about having to sync it with iPads and iPhones. To me, the operating system is now officially junk. For extremely little gain you put up with endless hours of grief typical of older Apple OS problems in the OS 9 days.  I upgraded because Apple was getting rid of ""me.com"" and replacing it with iCloud, which I could care less about.  Os Lion was required to do that.  Pretty sneaky if you ask me. Of course Lion broke numerous software titles, not the least of which was Passwords Plus which held all my life's passwords.  At this time, that one can't be fixed even with DataViz's import program, which transfers the data to an insecure Excel document (if it had worked). This alone shows the incredible fallibility of putting passwords and bank accounts into computer programs. It's just not safe.  The woman next to me at the Apple store tried to rely on Apples TimeMachine backup to restore her computer, but it failed under Lion.  So nothing is safe around a Lion! I should have known..

Lion also broke Business Card Composer, Photoshop and other critical programs. This of course helps Apple, which charged me to go to iPhoto 11 so it could work with iCloud as well as its partners as I spend hundreds of dollars and numerous hours to upgrade applications that Lion broke. All for what, ""gestures?"" and other hardly worth it gimmicks?  Apple is definitely a pirate of Silicon Valley.  It pushes around its trapped customers today, just as much as it always has.  Pretty soon we'll have Mountain Lion.  I was perfectly happy with Me.com and my old OS leopard and all my applications. Apple is just another monopoly taking advantage of its trapped audience.  I don't like 'em and now that Jobs is gone, I wouldn't trust Apple, Inc. further than I can throw a stick.  Never trust any  99 cent company.  i.e. $499 vs $500 for an iPad.  Tricky on the outside always means tricky on the inside. Just another dirt-bag corporation.

By the way, the ""download only"" idea stank to high heaven.  It took forever, crashed and I had to go to the Apple Store to fix it.  I feel for folks that don't have an Apple store nearby that got stuck with that horrendous problem.  This was almost as bad as using AT&T as the iPhone's sole service provider.

Windows 7 to me is nothing more than Vista with window dressing and many of the old bugs Vista had; however, many reviewers find it to be the best thing since sliced bread.

 Recently I've been seeing incredibly negative reviews about Quicken Essentials for Mac.  Not only that, but I don't believe Intuit has seen a positive Quicken for Mac review in the last 6 years.  Something about Macs and Quicken apparently don't mix.

 Keep in mind I already have the negative mindset just from the other reviews so I'm expecting trolls to leak from my hard drive and wreak havoc on my accounts.  Sorry, no green, hairy trolls ever appeared.

 In fact, I was shocked.  For the intended purpose, this program does what you pay it to do.  It keeps track of your accounts, bank or otherwise and downloads updates as you request.

 True, it's a little quirky, but so are most Mac programs when compared to Windows equivalents and that's part of the problem.  Essentials is for Mac not for Windows so the comparisons are unfair.

 This isn't to say it's all a bed of roses for those coming from Windows.  Converting Windows based Quicken files is difficult and here's a clue - don't bother.  It just won't work and what you'll see in the end isn't what you had in the beginning.  If you've got 25 years of financial matter then you had better consider using a virtual machine or going back to a pc.

 By this point you've figured it's easier to just download your account information from banks and brokerages but this is where Essentials does fail the Windows user.

 You first have to download the information as a Web Connect file to your desktop and then drag and drop it to a box in Quicken at which point it's loaded as an account.  Sound familiar?  If you use Quicken's online equivalent at [...] this is nearly the same procedure minus the drag and drop.  This means you'll have to open a browser, go to your bank or brokerage, open the account, download the file to the desktop, close your browser session and then drag and drop the desktop file.  Once you delete the desktop file you've just completed seven steps to create an account.

 And who thought this up?

 However, once that procedure is done you've got your accounts up and running.  Minor inconvenience compared to the original Quicken I used many years ago that required manual entries and had nothing in the way of internet connection.

 Other complaints seem to focus on the lack of online bill paying through this Quicken, a feature I never used or appreciated in the Windows version because it wasn't free.  I've just used my bank's free only bill payment feature therefore I can't comment on what I don't use.

 Yes, you could use equivalents such as Moneydance, iBank or iCash but none offer online updating - Quicken has a lock on that feature.

 In addition, you can't lose with Quicken because of the 60 day unconditional money back guarantee.  If you don't like it, return the software for a full refund.  I've used the refund procedure one time (last year when a relative gifted me a Starter edition when I wanted Deluxe) and they do honor it.  Buy Moneydance or iCash and there is no refund since they offer a free trial.

 Overall I just didn't see much to be negative about with this program.  It does what it was designed to do and does it well.  It won't please advanced users expecting minute-by-minute stock updates and flashing lights, but it does an admirable job for the intended purpose.",Not Bad for Intended Use,1274832000,,

There is a table on the back of every box to help you pick which version you need. It has been accurate in my experience:

When I was young, I could get by with a 1040EZ, which is equivalent to TurboTax's free software.
As my career progressed, I graduated to TurboTax Basic.
When I married, our combined assets bumped us into Deluxe and then Premier.
We don't own a business, so we may never need Home & Business.

Prior to this, I had never revisited Basic. I was curious to experience how much I was gaining from using Premier. Without going into too much detail, the difference is night and day. I think they sit too far apart in the gamut for an honest comparison, like comparing a Corolla to an Avalon. But it is clear that our family will never get by with Basic. Thankfully, this was provided to me free of charge under the Vine program, but otherwise, it would have been $30 wasted. I'll stick with Premier.

6.  The one negative I have of version 3.0 has been corrected in 4.0.  That is the identity safe.  If you depend on it to remember logins (I do), you are then addicted to Norton.  The new version will allow you to export your safe contents so you can put it on a pocket drive and carry it with you.
7.  Norton support is really good if you have an issue.  I bought this product because it was cheaper than paying for another year of protection.  Current annual subscription rate renewal is $49.95.  You can find a low cost version on the internet and you can enter the key code to renew and never even use the CD.  The one problem I had was that I had time left on my current subscription and when I entered the key code I was given 365 days.  I lost 22 days of my existing subscription.  Support corrected this and added 30 days.  I would wait to the last day of your current subscription to avoid this.  Norton is pretty quick to recognize issues, so this may no longer exist as a problem.

Update:  I was wrong about Norton recognizing this issue.  I just renewed my subscription and I was 30 days early.  I lost the 30 days and had to go through Norton Support to get it fixed.  It wasn't so bad though, they gave me 60 days not 30.  I bought V4 at a good price, and used the product key to renew my subscription and upgrade to V5.

Update:  V5 fixed the optimization of Solid State Drives which do not need optimization, and generally, should not be optimized.  360 recognizes those drives and does not optimize them.  It also fixed an error in the registry scan which I had to disable in V4.  It would delete a necessary key to one of my programs.  One problem remains and that is it does not function well in the 64 bit version of Internet Explorer.

Update:  V5 does not count a Virtual PC installation against the 3 installation allowance.  I am running Win7 Pro with a free install of WinXP provided by MS.  It runs within Win7.  MS recommends an antivirus program be installed in the Virtual PC even though you already have one installed in Win7.

Update:  V6 has done away with keeping the Identity Safe on a pocket drive.  It must have produced a lot of risk for them and their customers.  I upgraded to V6 and expected my thumb drive Identity Safe to function normally, but I got a message only allowing me to copy the Identity Safe to the computer running Norton V6.

I have to declare myself thoroughly delighted with both of them.  I knew Trend Micro from 8 or 9 years ago when I got to know it as a free online system scanner.  I used it several times to rid myself of pesky viruses that McAfee could not deal with.

The specific thing I like about the Trend Micro is that it really doesn't slow the system down at all, while providing apparently great protection (I've had no virus problems that I'm aware of).  Some antivirus programs I've used really slow the computer down and make looking at pages on the Internet a drag.  But the Trend Micro has been almost invisible.

I have been very happy with the feature whereby it clears out the malicious cookies that are downloaded onto my computer through surfing the Internet.  Each day it deletes spybots and data miners without my prompting it.

If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.","If you've used TurboTax before, you know what to expect.",1388966400,,

Example of this would be remote desktop, an amazing feature that allows you to actually control your computer from another computer running Windows XP Pro. Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is ""awesome"", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The ""start menu"", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the ""start menu"" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, ""ME"" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers.

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

Until Microsoft decides to natively decode blue ray through Windows Media Center (or whatever replaces it in Windows 8), you need a separate piece of software like this one.

For reference, I have an HTPC with a dual core 2.4ghz processor, 8gb of ram, and a blue-ray player connected to my plat panel TV.

PowerDVD is par for the course these days--sloppy, poorly coded garbage full of unnecessary bloat, with no option to install only the components you want or need. It reminds me of the way NERO went from a streamlined, easy to use program to a boat-fest resource hog. I also dislike how (as other reviewers noted) PowerDVD installs services that work in the background, sending your private data to corporations. Unless you manually stop them, they will track everything you watch and send that data off to marketing companies.

I didn't have any issues installing the software. Things went smoothly, and I was able to easily play a DVD. However, I elected NOT to keep this software on my computer, largely because a much easier solution exists for me. (I don't need it to play anything but Blue-Rays; I use XBMC for playing all my other media). An easy, frustration free way to play Blue Rays is with VLC (a free, excellent media player). Just use it to make .MKV files from each Blue Ray disk and then play them with VLC. For complete instructions, check the comments section of this review.

Basically, this is an overpriced, largely problematic software that you don't really need unless you just have to play Blue-Rays and don't want to mess around with VLC to rip them to .MKV files.

There's a pizza place near me that doesn't sell ""small"" or ""medium"" sized pizzas (this has a point, I promise).  It DOES sell ""large"", ""huge"", ""gigantic"" and ""enormous"" pizzas.  I can usually remember that the 12"" is called ""large"", but I can never remember if it's the 14"" or the 16"" that is ""huge"" or if the 26"" is ""enormous"" or ""gigantic"".  In the end, I just say either ""your second smallest"" or ""the 14-inch one"" because that makes much more sense and I'm certain to get what I'm expecting.

Software companies often do the same thing.  In this case the most stripped down version is known as ""Deluxe"".  ""Deluxe"" is defined to mean ""luxurious or sumptuous; of a superior kind"" and yet that's the exact opposite of what you get when you buy the ""Deluxe"" product (just like when you buy a ""large"" pizza, you are really getting the exact opposite--a small pizza).  The next version up is ""Ultra"" (that's the one I have) which means ""extreme"", ""at the edge"", or even ""beyond"", when in fact it is a mid-level product.  Then you have ""Ultimate"", ""Ultimate Suite"", and finally ""Director Suite"".  Having this many versions is bad enough, but the naming is downright confusing and drives me nuts... to the point that I'm going to have to remove a star.  Sorry guys.  Now cut it out.

<pauses for a breath... trying to find a happy place... sigh...>

As for the software itself, I have used PowerDirector 12 for a while now and have appreciated it's user interface and feature set.  A year or two ago, I was working on what appeared to be a very simple project--I imported a movie I had gotten online (legally downloaded, I'll have you know) and was trying to edit it for time so a co-worker could use it in a presentation.  The effects were all very simple: fade in/fade out, etc. but even though I spent a couple of hours with various video editing programs, I could not get it to work for me.  As I recall, Adobe Premier Pro CS5 couldn't understand the input file format so first I converted it with an AVS4You program.  Then I had it all edited the way I wanted, but Premier had a zillion and fifty output format settings and I couldn't seem to find the magical combination that would work on my co-worker's Mac and still be a reasonable size (either the file was HUGE, the quality was TERRIBLE, or it just wouldn't work on the Mac).  Next I switched to Pinnacle Studio 14, but it had issues, too--I don't remember what they were, but it was obvious that Pinnacle was a no-go.  Finally I tried PowerDirector.  It was more or less the first time I had used the program, and yet in under an hour, I had a fully rendered video that was a good quality, reasonable file size AND it played on my Windows PC and my co-worker's Mac.

As a side note, I'm pretty sure that Premier Pro can do all the things I've used PowerDirector for, but the darn program has such a learning curve that I often spend a good deal of time just trying to figure out how to do something as simple as fading from one clip to another.  Oh, sure--once you know how to do it, it's easy and once you have been working with the program for a long time, you'll probably find features much faster, but for a novice like myself, it's usually just a frustration.  PowerDirector, on the other hand, has an interface that to me is very intuitive.

You can go to Cyberlink's web site to view all the new features in 13 from 12, but in my opinion, the most noteworthy change is the addition of 2 new formats, XAVC-S and H.265/HEVC.  As noted previously, I'm no video editing expert and I don't use these programs often, but from what I can tell, the look and feel has not changed in any significant way.

If you are reading reviews trying to figure out which video editing program you want to get, I would highly recommend one of the flavors of PowerDirector.  Just go to the web site first so you know what it is you are getting (and what you are not) with the version you pick--the name sure as heck ain't gonna' tell ya!","PowerDirector 13, level 2 is an easy to use, full featured video editor",1417564800,,

I am giving the software 4 out of 5 stars because sometimes it can be cumbersome to edit things after I have entered them.

After you capture a snapshot, a thumbnail of it appears in the Storyboard. You can play and edit your movie in the Storyboard as you go along. The Control Panel lets you add a grid to the liveview in the View Screen to help you position your characters precisely where you need them (the grid size can be adjusted). One VERY nifty feature in the Control Panel is called Key Drawing. Key drawing lets you sketch over the View Screen, so you can mark the position(s) of your character(s) in the next frame.

There are also special effects you can play around with, like green screen, which allows you to change the background (your backyard, for example) after production. You can also get really artistic and use the drawing and painting tools to add other elements (like gunsmoke, flare, and laser beam).

Honestech's Stopmotion Studio is so incredibly intuitive that even a novice like myself (who has never done stopmotion movies) has no problem using it. As an adult, I have to admit I had a lot of fun using Stopmotion Studion.

Photoshop is a very difficult, expensive and challenging program though and unless you are a photographer or an artist, you can probably do as well or better with Paint Shop Pro 7.  It is easier to learn and operate and does an enormous range of image editing tasks.  I've produced excellent original art work on it.  I also have edited or manipulated images with ease.

The price was so low (compared to Adobe Illustrator, the only competition) that examples of Corel would show up in ordinary office documents, like the ""Word-Art"" equivalents as headlines.

But that was then. Nowadays Corel is, unfortunately, a second-string company, eclipsed by the Adobe Empire. But also the market has changed. There are millions of digital photographers, seduced by the promise of ""No developing - pictures immediately."" That's a market that's served by plenty of programs these days, and it's not as easy as it once was to make a name for yourself.

The market has several free and low-cost options which are simplified versions of major programs like Photoshop. Photoshop is my weapon of choice, but I'd be the first to admit that it's way too complicated for the average snap-shooter to understand. In many cases people just want to remove red-eye from flash, and have some easy way to sort their pictures.

Even Photoshop Elements is over the heads of many users, so the best choice for one's mythical ""grandparents"" are those free and low-cost programs for under $50. There are numerous options, including photo manipulating programs that come for free to download, or free with an operating system or camera. To succeed in this area a program will have to be better than the others.

Unfortunately Corel Paint Shop Photo Express just isn't different enough. Other reviewers have compared it to Picasa (free) and other cheap options. The interface simplifies tasks, but so do the interface in many similar programs. Free programs like Windows Live Photo Gallery and Picasa have advanced features like face recognition, which I couldn't find in the Corel offering.

So why is Corel's offering here? My only guess is that some unscrupulous salespeople in the big electronic stores will mention to a new purchaser of a Windows 7 computer that ""it doesn't come with Photo-Editing software."" They then point the buyer to a row of Photo-Editing software that they can sell to the unsuspecting, because you can download Windows Live Photo Gallery from Microsoft for free. It's not in Windows 7 so that other companies can get a shot at this market, but I think you'll find that the Microsoft offering is better than Corel's.

So, sorry, yet another voice against this program. A pity, because I would have like Corel to do well, but it didn't happen in this case.","Too little, too late",1261958400,,

This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.

The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Price includes federal E-File
* Overall, probably the best tax program there is
* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?)
* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition
* Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements
* I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.

WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):

* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier)
* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)","Most likely the best there is, but not perfect",1390176000,13,

There were some opportunity areas (for example, if you add a music file to a menu you have no way to edit the audio file or select a portion of it, I have to use Cool Edit to format the audio file to what I need) So I thought the retail version would have more functionalities than the one I already had and decided to get this one.

First of all I had no problems installing it, while I am stuck with the awful Windows Vista, installation ran smoothly and with no incidents. The software comes with a manual that I honestly have not used, the features are very easy to use and so far I have not needed to consult the user guide.

There are three applications and only two of them I have used, the one I haven't tried I really do not have a use for it which is to extract video files from a camera or similar device. I own a Sony DHC and I use the basic windows functionality to extract the files from it.

The first one I'd like to talk about is the video editing software included. While it may not have as many functionalities as the retail box makes you believe, it has some interesting features. First of all, it allows you to select an intro theme to your video which then you can add music to, same as the DVD factory I previously owned, there is no way to edit the audio you use in here, so say the intro is about 10 seconds and you add an mp3 file of over a minute, the song will play over the menu AND your video. There is a neat feature that allows you to trim your video and select the bits and pieces you want to keep or remove. What I liked the most is that this program offers the possibility of extracting video from a DVD and then edit the video on your own. I tried several of my home made DVDs and some of them worked and some others didn't, which is a shame but I believe it might be due to the way in which they were recorded, the ones that didn't work were recorded with a DVD recorder I got to copy my VHS into DVDs. I also tried some music DVD's I own playing with the idea of creating a music video compilation, well, it worked. What the program does is that it extracts the selected video track from the DVD into an mpeg file, from there you can edit it or keep a backup copy of it if you like.

After you are done editing and preparing your videos you can then create your movie. So far I have only created DVDs and VCDs and it has worked great, there are several templates included, some of them look very professional and some others look like they were made in power point, fortunately, the menus can be personalized and you can add/remove things to your taste. In the case of DVD menus there is a feature that allows you to edit the background music, something I really appreciated as I won't have to rely on an external program to do so.

Overall, a great product with some neat functionalities, I have lots of videos I have taken with my Sony camera as well as others I have downloaded and I am happy I got this product. The only time it has failed is when I attempted to open a divx formatted file, it crashed.

Let start by saying I am an old time user of CorelDraw.  I used it for years at my job and loved it.  The Suite X8 offers much more and still has the feel and performance I remember.  I am also a Adobe Photoshop user.  I ended up moving more into using Photoshop mainly due to more local classes and support compared to CorelDraw, though Corel was/is my favorite.  If you are looking at this Suite I'm sure it is because you know what you need for your job.  I don't see the hobby types using or buying this based on the cost.

Installation was painless and flawless.  I guess we would hope so for this price range of product.  Once installed I find everything seems to work well.  I would like to give a more detailed review, however I am unable with the amount of time given me to complete this.  You see, I received this from Amazon Vine to review and I received this package for the cost of the taxes on the product.  I will make a good attempt to update this review as I have more time to explore and use it.

At first I was skeptical about what they meant, but after using the program; yes it is a problem. I am going to cover that as well as several other points important to know.

Back up your company files right before loading the new version 2013. It only takes a second, and makes your test drive easily reversible.

You have a choice of jumping off of the diving board by loading the new version of QB 2013 by overwriting the old version, and then converting your existing company files but unconverting them, and restoring them is a major hassle. So the following is important to know.

You can run both versions of QuickBooks (in my case 2010 and 2013) concurrently/at the same time. So you are keeping your old version of QuickBooks intact while you try out the new one. (They currently have a 60 day return policy so take it for a test drive) This is important. When installing it asks you, ""Do you want to overwrite your old version?"" If you want to test it out and not go through the rigamarole of reconverting, or restoring your old version in case you want to send the new version back, say NO by choosing the option above it in order to write it to a new location. They already have a folder designated to do that when you choose that option and it is called ""QuickBooks 2013"". Don't worry about choosing your industry edition; you can always change it later from within QuickBooks. Note: If you install it on more than one computer you must install the same industry edition. This way you can try QuickBooks without over writing your existing version, OR converting your current company files over to the 2013 version either. So play with the sample file, or do as I did if you are creating a new company in addition to the old one. So with both version running and open, if I have an order from a customer from one company I can process it without having to open and close companies to access it. In plain words I have one click access to both companies. So both Qbooks versions are open, and both companies are open at the same time. That is something you cannot do if you only have one version of QuickBooks. You can however have two companies open if you install QB into a laptop also. (They allow you one other install but only if you use the same industry edition. So for example if you have a manufacturing company and a retail business they have different industry editions)

So now onto the three pound monster; the color schemes. In 2012 you had the option of choosing an assortment of color schemes. You don't have that option in 2013. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that they chose colors that create headaches; well at least in some people.  I love the way 2010 looks. It is reminiscent of Outlook 2007 with its soft blues and grays. It is pleasant to look at and easy to read. 2013 has the same icons and choices (how are they going to improve on something in any major way that has been through a zillion years of tweaking to make it Intuit-ive?) BUT they changed it slightly with the biggest problem as I see it (no pun intended) is they included black backgrounds with reversed out white letters. Our eyes get adjusted to that, and then on the same page they have these super soft letters on a bright background which is a seismic shift. I can see what they mean that this could give you a headache after awhile. So I thought I would convert it some by minimizing the left side navigation pane, which is easy to do with one click of the mouse, but the problem is that when you use any one of the features such as invoicing, credit memos, estimates etc up comes those screens with the same black header reversed out and you can't change that.  On a cerebral-vision basis it is not conducive to reducing the workload, but rather increasing it. Your eyes and vision set have to constantly readjust depending on which part of the page you are focusing on.  As soon as you open the program and spend a few minutes with it, you immediate feeling will be how do I change the black headers only to find out you can't. The headers also give you a feeling of the old DOS days; it is real basic and the level of graphics is Neanderthal. The rest of the work area is fine. I don't have any problem with soft lettering, or the nicely colored icons; just change the headers, and/or include some color scheme changes.
What else is there?

I have been using Intuit products since the DOS days in the 80's. Easy to use, intuitive, and great for small businesses. There is no way they are not going to fix this. There are too many people complaining about it. It will have a devastating effect on sales. Intuit is the best and I am sure they will be updating by re-creating the color scheme choice like they had in 2012, or at the very least go back to the pleasant default color scheme in some earlier versions. If they don't hold onto your 2012 version because they are going to become more and more valuable especially if Intuit stops making the 2012 version.

UPDATE: Okay I am going to have to tip my hat because Intuit did ""correct"" the problem. Why do I put quotes around correct? I don't want to nit pick but I have to be critical. What they did with R6 free update (R9 is out now) is ""Company File Color Scheme"" option is introduced in the ""Desktop View"" preference to allow users to change the color of the title bar and the border of QuickBooks windows for a particular company file, which will help users to differentiate between multiple company files. This preference will be replacing the ""Company Color Flag"" preference introduced in R4 release. We are offering 14 different ""Company File Color Scheme"" options to apply on various company files. This is a user level preference, which essentially means that various users connected to the same company file can select different colors. (R6)

That was a copy and paste from Intuit of the improvement. What it means is that the title bars have been made adjustable into some really nice colors. My main concern was how the large black background area with white text was creating an eye set, if I can use that expression which was pretty bold, and then you had to re-adjust your eyes in order to see the fine print in lighted out gray in the forms etc. So it was a headache waiting to happen. At first I dismissed others comments but then saw exactly what they were saying, and had to agree with them. So what did Intuit do? They did not get rid of the large black background to the main menu on the left, BUT you can minimize that so it is a small border on the left side of the screen. Then they gave you this option to change the title bar color options with some beautiful colors, while at the same time changing the title bar titles themselves into all caps to help balance the visibility out. All in all it is very useable now.

In all fairness in my 2010 version the invoices for example have black backgrounds with white letters in the inner title bars but the black bars are a lot thinner. 2013 has large black bars still. BUT with the other changes it is very manageable, and I would now have to say that I give the whole program a triple thumbs up and 5 stars. I also must admit that the left main menu is easier to read with a black background and white letters, rather than a lesser contrast option so they did good. The fact that you can minimize that whole window, and then you are working almost exclusively in your color choice (and the ones they give you are beautiful) makes this a top drawer program. I am once again in love with Quickbooks, yes even the 2013 version.","They Fixed the Color Scheme, See my Update, Where Else are You Going to Go?",1352592000,47,

I was sad I got plus because I didn't realize there was a higher ultimate version and there was no way to upgrade. So this time I'm glad to be getting ultimate.

Things that are new for 19:
-Project Bins--a bin that you can throw a bunch of video/sound that you want to use, or a way to put video/sound into a organized bins without having to move the videos from the folders they really are located in. The bins contain video links, not the actual videos. This is great for me. I like having my videos organized by time and events. Also I have tons of videos and pictures in one folder. This allows me to grab the best and bin them without creating duplicate video folders and taking up more space. It helps me not to have to go through a folder with hundreds of pictures/videos over and over again. I love this feature! (And they needed to add it since Adobe Elements 13 added it)
-Even more effects--like I didn't waste enough time already over effecting my home videos... Thankfully there's now a favorite section so you can put your favorite effects where you can easily get to them.
-Multicam support--If you have a party or wedding or wherever you might have more than one people videoing, it's pretty cool to be able to jump around the cams. If you have audio for your videos, it even tries to line them up automatically!
-Support for more file types and better 4k support.

When you open it up, it looks very similar to 17 or 18. It's an evolution and refinement with more features. It's good to know they didn't change everything! It's run pretty smoothly so far, but I have a pretty powerful computer. I don't have anything higher than 1080p to play with, but I've not had issues. I do suggest you use the system requirements as a very minimum requirement. I wouldn't try running this on anything less than an i5 with 8GB of ram and would prefer to have an actual video card in there too--and that may still give you a lot of waiting when crunching higher res video. I wish Pinnacle would give you a suggested computer setup for different levels of performance. I'm running it on an XEON 1650v3 with an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 and 16GB of ram. That's basically the equivalent of a high end i7 and a GTX 750. You're going to have a completely different experience running this on your $400 laptop than a performance machine. Video editing takes a lot more processing than picture editing.

But I was able to trim, split, combine single and multiple HD videos with no issues. I could have saved in many formats and DVD. It does bluray with an additional purchase. But, disk based media is practically dead. I'm just glad it lets me save it as a mp4. It will also export to Facebook, Youtube, and Vimeo.

My understanding is that Pinnacle provides little if any support. And I think that's the main disadvantage over Adobe Premier Elements. I can google all sorts of issues with Adobe Premier Elements and find all kind of help. It may be slow support with a strong accent, but I can call Adobe. Pinnacle Studio does have tutorial videos on their site and on Youtube. It looks like more videos for 19 are coming and most of the 18 videos do apply. There is a knowledge base in the support section and the ability to email support (free for 15 days from purchase...). If it works great, you're good. If it doesn't work for you or you have problems with the program--good luck...

But for me it's been working great. It hasn't crashed once. The way it works makes sense to me. If you're still deciding, go to youtube and search for ""Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate - Basic Editing Beginners Tutorial"". That will give you an idea of how the program works.

This is obviously great for professional use, but it is also just fine for budding artists.  I actually also recommend getting this for children.  The creative freedom here is endless.  Also, if you give it to a 10 year old, you'll have someone to teach you!  Don't underestimate the child's mind.  I say this because once you begin the program you will be overwhelmed with so much, you might think it's over your head.  Beginners can simplify their fears and go at their own pace.

Very fast response and no lag, so there is a flawless flow of brushing and drawing.

The variety of brush categories are endless as there are sub categories as well.  But there are also many special effects giving you access to create with patterns and color mixes. Also playing with photos is fun with features like tracing paper and making a painting out of any photo. There are some software programs out there that just create painting effects on photos, but you don't have any creative input.  With Painters version, you still have access to all the brushes and the tracing paper allows you to be as detailed as you would like.

I'd recommend it for learning a language, although it will never compare to living in a foreign country and speaking only that language.

Pros:
Rosetta stone's process is a lot better than traditional ""current language word = foreign language word"" learning processes, which rely on memorization and lead to internal translation from the foreign language to one's native language while speaking.  Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.  There is plenty of repetition of previous words, but at no point does the process seem like rote recitation.

The software is divided into ""lessons"" which introduce new words, and have several exercises including matching, pronouncing each part of the word, verbally filling in blanks with your new words, etc.  There is plenty to keep you interested and ensure that you learn new words and phrases.

The voice recognition was decent, a simple training has the program hearing you correctly ~90% of the time, and an adjustable slider can reduce the pickiness the software has if you're having issues, although that also controls how strictly you want to be held to pronunciation.

Cons of Rosetta Stone:
-It's expensive

Unfortunately, any Internet user has to be aware of how these words can affect how safely they navigate the Internet today. They have become as normal a part of Internet culture as an email address or facebook membership. If you are careful, and I mean *really* careful, you can get away with using the Internet without a ""security"" product--or more likely these days, a suite of products. I know some who do this without issues, but they're all systems administrators with decades of security administration under their belts. Most however should not venture out into the wild unprotected.

Enter Kasperksy. I have used various other A/V (anti-virus) programs in the past--McAfee is the choice anti-malware at my work--and there are a few things I judge them by, starting with what I call the overhead factor. Because these programs run constantly, just how much CPU time and system memory do they require? Like a good butler, I judge these programs by how little I notice them until (hopefully not) I need them. Of course, there are other judging criteria such as the heavily important one of how effective it is in catching and eradicating malware, and then how easy is it to use and finally, what's the upkeep? Downloading updates, how often the virus signatures are updated, etc.

I'm happy to say that Kasperky AV 2009 scores quite highly in each of the above departments. The installation itself was simple although not quick. On my Vista 32-bit Ultimate PC, it took almost 25 minutes and one restart to get it installed. In addition, it took a few more minutes to install updates; in total, set aside about an hour to get it installed and fully operational. This is a bit long, as you may imagine.

Thereafter, but for one little problem [update below], Kaspersky ran without problems. It was quite straightforward to configure and the reports of its activities are easy to read. The memory and CPU overhead are minimal considering what it does which is categorized in three general areas: anti-malware, system security and online security. For anti-malware, we have files and memory security, email and IM security and web traffic security. System security covers what it calls ""proactive defense,"" which means it protects against the usual suspects (Trojans, worms, keylogger detection, hidden driver installation, OS kernel modifications--this is not a default however--and hidden object detection).

Setting all of these via the intuitive GUI is ... well, intuitive. There are some great real-time graphs of system and software activity which is all logged for later reference. Statistics are kept for a year while reports are kept, by default, for 30 days or 1GB whichever is less. It's all quite simple to manage.

The problem I spoke of before has to do with a pet peeve of mine and the reason I uninstalled McAfee from this very same computer. I fly online with Flight Simulator on a network known as VATSIM. Both McAfee and Kaspersky prevent normal operations of multiplayer function on VATSIM (and some others, I've heard) even though you have paused protection. I would like to be able to completely turn off anti-virus protection when I want and not have it actually continue to work regardless of setting.
[Update: Boy, was I wrong! Kaspersky does not interfere with VATSIM traffic. I'm not sure why it happened a time or two when I tried initially, but I've since discovered there are no issues whatever with running Kaspersky and VATSIM concurrently. This could have been because of the numerous updates to the software, but regardless, this bumps it up into the 4.5 star class.]

Apart from this, I judge Kaspersky A/V 2009 to be a top player in the field. I only wish the free update time period would be for more than one year for what it's worth, but that's a measure of how valuable I believe the software to be.

Meeks Jr.,"Tiffen's DFX is a collection of filters that emulate different film processing types, lenses and other photographic effects. Many of the filters are high quality, producing convincing effects. The fog effect, for instance, does a credible job of adding a soft mist to an image.

All the included filters (which there are many of them) are accessed through a ""strip"" that runs along the bottom of the window for the App. Clicking on an effect brings up a tiled set of variations on that filter that can be quickly selected and previewed - much like the old ""variations"" panel in Photoshop. In addition, the presets can be further configured through a ""parameters"" tab, which greatly expands the functionality of these filters. On top of this, filters can be ""stacked"" in layers.

Masks are simple to do, and there are several ways to create them, including gradient, selection tool and a line select mode. As with the filters, you can have multiple masks, which can easily be tweaked through a bar that runs along the top of the window.

For those used to Instagram type of filters, this software will present a challenge, since it reaches far beyond applying the stock ""vintage lomo-esque"" type of effects. Some of the effects are extremely useful, some are sheer novelty (night vision) which will probably only be used once in a great while.

One final note concerning installation on a Mac. The software comes on a CD with a .exe file for installing the software on Windows. But for the Mac, there is a zip file that has to be copied off of the disk, and then unpacked. At that point you mount a disk image, which contains the installer. It would have been simpler to at least gotten rid of the dumb step which requires copying the zip file to the Mac before installing. Note that one installer is used for all variations of the DFX software (including the plugin for Photoshop), so be sure to pick the right one for the software you have a license for - although you can still install versions you don't have a license for, and run them in a limited time trial mode.

How is that old spouse doing? :-) Anyhow this has to be the king of all online ancestry tools. I was surprised to know that my grandmother arrived in this country and when instead of being second generation. I was curious what part of Italy she came from. This and a whole lot more is available online utilizing the built in resources family tree taps into.

The really interesting thing is that since it is so widespread that others even distant relatives who have participated and did the leg work to build the tree can be imported into your own tree. The Platinum version includes a six month membership into Ancestry.com which is no small feat because that is about ninety dollars worth of membership. This deluxe version provides 3 months. Even if you bought family tree maker and used it for 6 months you could find just about all of the information that you would need. With the Platinum version the fact that another disc with the platinum version is included in the box to give to someone else, enables you to partake on the journey with another family member, although a second membership into Ancestry is not included.

In using it I found that just like any other application there is a slight learning curve. They included a thick book with it so this is not something you just sit down and become an expert at in an afternoon. That is a good thing because the deeper you want to get into it, the more complex the program becomes.

I always envied those families that we still all together. They had certain bonds that made it that way. For example even though flaw abound, they stuck together, never back sliding one another. Oh they may discuss particular person's anomalies, but never is a condemning way. My own family became particulated... a fancy word for broken apart. My Mom grew up with relatives galore; by the time I came into the picture it was splintered apart. Who offended who? The interesting thing is that I have a huge family out there. My grandmother's sister had 7 children; most of them live in the area I am sure. The older generation passed away, and maybe the offenses passed with them. I am not disrespecting the older generation, I love them, but I would like to see if this huge family can become a family again. It is a new time, and who hated who is irrelevant.

I have someone I know who has a huge family and once a year they rent out this park where they have an outside picnic, everyone brings a dish. That way you are not inviting all kinds of people into your house, some that are so distant you don't even know who they are. It works, and I would like to try it. Family Tree Maker makes that possible. So if you are just interested in who came before you, and who they married, or gave birth to, or you want to utilize this to re-establish long lost family connections, get Family Tree Maker. It is an exciting journey as you are discovering how it works, and they provide a lot of built in help, and tutorials along the way. Overall highly recommended.",Curious about who came before you?

Hill,"""CorelDRAW Suite X5: Home and Student"" is a good package for making logos and general graphic work, but it is very useful for those needing vector graphic images. We use vector graphics for laser etching (provided by a local trophy company) of gift products and the CorelDraw program worked perfectly, allowing us to provide the files ready for the etcher. The interface is intuitive and also works well with my Bamboo drawing tablet, which is a big plus.

The Photo-PAINT application is fairly good for photo editing, especially if you don't already have an editing program on your PC. This has a range of correction and special effects filters that are easy to apply. I use Adobe Photoshop for most of my photo work, so this program will not be getting a lot of use.

Installation was very straight forward and took about a half hour start to finish on my aging laptop running Windows 7. The included tutorials are very helpful and did help me come up to speed much faster than poking around the programs on my own.

As the years went by, the reality is that most of the world is on PCs, not Macs.  I wasn't doing enough graphics work to justify a good package, so I made a lot of graphics with Visio, PowerPoint, or (eeeek!) ""Paint"".  Finally, I moved up to Adobe PhotoShop -- What a headache!!!  It took a week's worth of classes to learn how to use the daggone thing!

Remembering how much better CorelDRAW was on the old Macs, I was eager to try this -- and I am NOT disappointed!  I have been using the PhotoPaint part of this package a lot, and it is - relatively speaking - intuitive to learn and easy to use.  Now, no graphics beginner is going to say that -- it's still a complicated package, but for someone with a decent graphics background (though by no means an expert), it's straightforward.  I have used the help file to find things, but once I find them, they are intuitive to use - I need the help file, but not a textbook or a class to teach me what the help file means!

PhotoPaint is POWERFUL, yet fairly direct.  A HUGE improvement over Adobe PhotoShop.  I would definitely choose Corel over Adobe here.  The products are a significant investment, though, so I would weigh how much I'm doing graphics before spending to upgrade to Corel, if I already had PhotoShop.  However, for any new ""seats"", licenses, computers, etc., I would definitely go Corel.

I also used the CorelDRAW part of the package, and for how I use vector graphics, it may be a little better than Visio or PowerPoint, but not a big difference.  I might choose it over the others, but I wouldn't bother with the expense to upgrade to it.

Ray,"As the happy owner of a new digital camera, it seemed natural to install some video editing software so I could play with my home videos a bit. Having used Corel's software in the past, I looked forward to trying VideoStudio Pro X6.

I've never edited video before and I've also never had a video camera before. I am very proficient with technology and computers, as my career is in IT. Based on past experience with other Corel products, I expected VideoStudio Pro X6 to be a bit more intuitive than it has been so far. Again, I am a complete novice at video editing, so perhaps this is part of a learning curve for me. Until I've had more time to learn and experiment, I'm giving the software a neutral rating while I tell you what I have experienced already.

The install went very smoothly. I put it on my laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate with 16 GB of Ram and an i7 processor. Launching the software is also smooth and the software doesn't take long to load on my PC.

Corel presents you with a mini help window when you first launch the software. The `Home' tab has information and links to helpful items, including a link to check for software updates. The `Learn' tab has helpful training videos. The `Do More' tab has a number of downloadable add-ons, many of which are free. And the last tab is for `Messages'.

There are also very thorough user guides you can download from their website. Normally, I find most software easy to figure out and refer to such manuals for extra tips and information I couldn't figure out on my own. It is apparent I will need to go through this one page by page to learn how to use this software. It would be nice if they had some tutorials that took you through various tasks step by step. There may be such but I haven't found them yet if there are.

So far, I've been able to get video clips into a project, although that took quite a bit of time for me to learn. The import function I found in the `Capture' area does not work as I had expected it to. Now that I have a video clip in the software to work with, I'm working on learning how to edit it and in what ways it can be modified.

As I said before, I am granting it a neutral 3-star rating for now. I had expected this software to be more intuitive - I've had no trouble learning Corel's photo editing software. Once I've worked with the software a bit more, I will adjust my rating however it is warranted and add the new experiences to my review. I do have to say, so far I find it disappointing that it has not been easier and more user friendly.

I liked it at the time but began using other products after that old laptop croaked and the new one did not come with the program installed. When I was using it years ago, it was essentially a cd/dvd creator. It seems it's gone through many upgrades over the past several years. With the current version, Roxio offers digital photo editing, movie making, video editing, music, storage, etc. In other words, it really is a ""suite"" now.

I installed this on Windows 7 (64 bit) and had no issues that required support from Roxio. I see that a number of reviewers with installation issues had some unpleasant experiences dealing with tech support which is unfortunate but also very believable.

As far as the ""suite"" of products included here, I'd say this is a good, moderately priced program for the home user because it's pretty straightforward and relatively simple to learn. Most of it is intuitive if you've ever used any time of digital media software in the past. If you've used Roxio products in the past, the upgrades are relatively simple to get used to.

On the plus side, this operating system is probably necessary to take advantage of modern processors like the I5 and I7. Other than that, it has caused NOTHING but trouble.

(1) A laser printer for which I paid hundreds of dollars no longer works because its available drivers won't work in the 64 bit environment.

(2) Several programs, for which I paid hundreds of dollars in good money, work poorly even after selection of older operating systems in compatibility mode. Two other programs--one of which manages my address and telephone contacts--do not work at all.

(3) Intellipoint, the software for the mouse, asks me repeatedly to insert a disk every time I start it. I have to click on this totally irrelevant box (asking me to insert a disk) seven or eight times every single time I start the computer. Uninstallation and reinstallation (more time down the drain) did not fix this. A daily annoyance from a poorly designed product.

(4) The scanner is far less easy to use on this new computer.

(5) Windows Explorer is less easy to use in the Windows 7 version than it was in Windows XP

Conclusion: with the sole exception of higher processing speeds that are probably facilitated by the 64 bit system, this operating system is a step DOWN from XP. It does not appear to me that Microsoft put much foresight into making sure that the new OS would not render hundreds of dollars' worth (or more, depending on the user's applications) of software and hardware partially usable or not usable at all. As matters stand, I will probably have to pay about $150 for a new printer thanks to this operating system. (I am also not happy with the printer's manufacturer, Konica Minolta, which has not been able to develop a 64 bit driver, but Microsoft needs to keep in mind the need to make it easy for other suppliers to develop drivers.)

I have spent hours fighting with ""permission"" settings and the registry--things most home and even small business users wouldn't know how to do--and the posted online solutions are absolutely worthless--which pretty much describes this Microsoft product. Bottom line: IF YOUR COMPUTER DOESN'T NEED THIS TO RUN, DO NOT INSTALL IT.

============================
Update: Windows 7 crashes CorelPhotoPaint 8, a program I use to create figures for professional articles and Web sites, repeatedly. I often have to restart it three or four times to get the job done which means I am probably wasting hours of time. That makes my one-phrase recommendation for this product, ""Worse than useless."" I did not have these problems in Windows XP.

It should be noted that this PC is a ""gateway"" PC for hosting wireless connectivity and Internet service, so the computer has to be rock solid secure, but doesn't see as much use as my laptop.

Norton was easy to install and is intuitive to use. The main screen is setup to be aesthetically pleasing, with a series of bubbles that you can choose from to drill down to more advanced functions. Unlike other virus programs I have used in the past, it does not become intrusive, causing windows to pop up during routine browsing or software installation. Advanced users will want to make use of the customization, in order to remain protected, yet keep Norton from overstepping its bounds. Norton can take care of threats on its own, or it can be set to ask the user what to do when a security risk is found.

One of the most useful features of 360 is that it can be used to easily set up a backup system. Backing up is an important task that many users overlook, so having an automatic tool takes all the thought out of the process. Norton will help you select which files you want to back up (pictures, video, financial files, documents), how big those files are, how often you want to back up, and the destination of the backup system. Plus -- Norton offers an online backup storage of 2 GB with an account in their system.

I've been a simple Quicken user for more than 10 years, upgrading along the way as Quicken updates yearly.  Updates are clearly just a way to ""milk"" users for more money but we're used to this, like Norton antivirus subscriptions.  But, when I update Norton, my computer still works okay.  I usually kept updating Quicken even though I didn't really need it.  If you get too far behind, the risks and learning curves just get higher.  I only use Quicken as a checkbook and for Bill Pay.  It has been flawless in paying bills so I'm happy about that.  What Quicken does is to release a new and buggy version every year, just before the end of the year.  After about 9 months, the bugs are worked and on the 10th month, they release a new version and here we go again.  I've learned over the years not to upgrade at the earliest opportunity because of bugs and because the upgrade gets cheaper later.  I saw the 2012 upgrade offered in 2011 but I waited. Then, in February 2012, I downloaded TurboTax from Amazon.  This went smoothly.  Amazon then sent me a killer low price Quicken 2012 offer.  Due to stupidity and greed on my part, I took the bait.  I have downloaded a number of s/w programs from Amazon and they have gone smoothly and installed without problems, including Quicken 2012 (not all prior Quicken versions installed without errors).  But, when I ran Q12, I found that I could no longer update my Wells Fargo checking account transactions.  Even though I am a simple (and now studid) user, I need the downloads to help me determine when I will run out of money in my checking account.  I try to not keep any more money there than I have to because very little interest is paid.  I had read about problems with downloads earlier but thought maybe they had been fixed or would not affect me.  So, here I am, what do I do?  I couldn't just ""restore"" my Q2011 version because the download and install didn't save the configuration before the new install (the TurboTax download and install DID save the current configuration).  So, I can't go back to my tried and true Q11 without some risk of losing my data.  I did research on the internet and via help but no solutions.  This is like buying a new car, driving it home, and then having to change the timing belt (by yourself) before you can drive it again.  Wells Fargo, and other banks, offer Bill Pay and it's free or at a nominal charge (6.95 for me versus 9.95 for Quicken).  So, I'm just a little ways away from dumping Quicken for good.  I can understand that new s/w features may have problems but I can't understand how simple things, like downloading transactions, can get broken.  Fortunately, Bill Pay seems to still be working.  It you're smarter than me, at least save your current configuration before installing Q12.

Re-edited 2/13/12 to add the following:  Received a comment on this post from a Quicken support person that I could always ""go back to Q11"".  So, I uninstalled Q12 and re-installed Q11. But YOU CAN'T GO BACKWARDS this way because Q12 REFORMATS your data file.  When I tried to restore the data file in the re-installed Q11, an error message says ""QUICKEN can't read this file""!!!  So, I had to uninstall Q11 and re-install Q12 so I could at least read my data and pay bills.  If Quicken had simply created a Windows Backup file before installing Q12, I would hope that a reversion via Windows Restore would work.  I just don't like taking chances with my data and auto pays and financial records by doing multiple installs and uninstalls.  My solution is to ""eat"" my copy of Q12 and switch to Wells Fargo Bill Pay.  It's free for me ($6.95/mo for some)and I don't have to pay for yearly Quicken bombs and $9.95/mo for Bill Pay.  I wish Amazon would allow ""negative"" stars because I would surely give Q12 one or more of them.",Don't Upgrade to This,1328745600,,

After 4 weeks of playing with these programs (I use Sony's higher end professional software for my business) I can easily give it 5 stars and a recommendation.

I record and edit movies as part of my business and Sony Vegas Pro has been my preferred software since 2012, when I switched from Adobe Premiere Pro.

The package notes the Parent's Choice award for version 20 on the back so we still thought we'd be okay.  It says it works for Windows 7 and it did install (although I needed to input my administrator password), but then we got a shock when we started the software.  Instead of getting the menu shown on the box to take a lesson, play games or whatever, our menu said only 'teacher' or 'student'.  Turns out the software was for a classroom.  The password required to set up the 'teacher' option, without which the 'student' option wouldn't work, was said to be in the administrative manual.  Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.

Since the package is opened, I can't take it back to the office supply store where it was purchased and will have to mail the software and receipt to the company (address in 1 pt font which requires a magnifying glass to read) and the refund will take 4 to 6 weeks.  I tried calling the number on the website and got a ridiculous phone menu run around.  After listening to the options and choosing the one that seemed to apply another recording said a representative couldn't help and to interface with the web instead.  Surely I'd just chosen the wrong option and called again choosing the other option, but got the same message.  Why would there even be a phone number to call if they aren't taking calls.

Will this OS be intalled onto a laptop or desktop? Is it networked? Will I use this for ""business type applications"" or ""personal type applications""? Do I need strong multimedia capabilities?
Windows 2000 Professional is an extremely stable OS. After running it for almost two weeks non-stop, I never had a single problem. Crashes and the infamous ""blue screen of death"" became obsolete things of the past (unless you're using ME). As long as I did what the OS told me, for example not installing unsigned drivers, the OS behaved the way I wanted it to.
Windows 2000 is also an excellent machine for networking, which is simplified by helpful wizards that will guide even a novice through. Because it is so simple to accomplish, this is a favorite OS for laptop users and businesses.
Windows 2000 lacks multimedia capabilities found in Windows ME. Some very simplistic multimedia functions are lost in this OS... If you are finding a gaming system, this is NOT it. Another downfall is that many of the drivers are special for 2000, because it lacks the DOS background in ME. This is very similar to XP. Do not worry about this problem however, because almost all equipment will have 2000 drivers.
Finally, Windows 2000 looks a lot like ME, making it convenient for an individual who is used to the 9x/ME environment to convert over to the 2000 environment, without crossing over the problems of ME.

We were going to use some 3D dinosaur models, pose them as needed in Poser then composite them in photoshop to make the illustrations.  All the parts seemed to be there but I keep running into issues.

Sometimes I have my computer hooked up to a hard drive on my desk, and I'd rather lean back in my chair  than have my hands on the keyboard. Or when I'm taking notes for research, I'll have my hands on a book and it's something of a pain to try and type while I'm holding the book open. On those occasions, Dragon Dictate comes in handy. I'd hoped that with the new speech recognition on Mac's Snow Lion that would solve my problem. But it really doesn't recognize words very well, and I need to go back and correct things nearly every sentence. With Dragon Dictate, I almost never need to make corrections. For example, I am writing this with Dragon Dictate. All I needed to do was open up the program, enable speech recognition, then click into the box for writing reviews. Now I am speaking this review, and it works just fine. The only times I need to make corrections are in cases where I use a possessive word in a context where it isn't obvious. In those cases, Dragon Dictate naturally treats the word as if it ends with an S, and then I need to go in and fix it. If you say something that you don't mean, or that looks wrong, just say delete. And it will remove the last thing you typed. If you want to remove a single word, just say delete, and the word. You do have to mention to place a comma or a period, and  I just realized that it has a hard time typing out the word ""comma.""  I know that the program comes with a list of keywords and commands that you can carry around with you, but I don't have them with me now and I don't even remember where they are, and all I really expect to do with this is dictation, but even without that dictation works pretty well. Again, I just dictated all of this and I only had a few corrections to make. Not bad, eh? (Note that I couldn't get it to type ""eh""; I had to spell it out. Oh well.)

Just for a quick comparison I am going to now dictate the first three sentences of my review using the built-in speech recognition on my Mac:

""well I generally prefer typing, Dragon dictate for Mac comes in handy when I'm not in the mood to type. Sometimes I have my computer hooked up to a hard drive on my desk, and I'd rather lean back in my chair and have my hands on the keyboard.

Anyhow, I won't be using this to open up applications, or shift between them. I'll just be using it for hands-free composition, and mostly only when I'm taking notes on something I'm reading.

I had no problems with installation. Registration was easy too but note that Corel asks you for your email address, company name and your physical address in order to complete registration. I entered only my email address and it registered just fine so you really don't have to provide any more information than that. The activation code is located underneath the CD in the CD case.

The EULA (End User License Agreement) allows you to have WinZip 18 Pro installed on one computer at any given time. You can install it on another computer, but only if you delete it from any other computer you previously installed it on. This is not the standard 3-computer license.

WinZip 18 pro will, of course, compress and decompress files into a portable, reasonable file size. This version can compress and decompress over 25 different file formats. It will also encrypt and decrypt sensitive data, convert documents to .PDFs (even read-only .PDFs), perform back-ups and even automatically burn them to CD/DVD/Blu-Ray, embed watermarks into photos and documents, view images in a zipped file without extracting them, rotate/resize/view images at full size from within a Zip file, and a ton of other helpful capabilities. The big news about version 18 is its cloud services integration. You can use direct access to cloud services, including Box, Google Drive, SkyDrive, Dropbox, CloudMe and SugarSync, to open zip files saved in the cloud, zip files before you upload or select files from the cloud to zip and share. It's also optimized for social networking sites like FaceBook. Go to the WinZip website for a complete outline of what this version has to offer.

So why the 3 stars? My problem is that you can perform all these tasks with currently available, shareware programs for free - including compressing and decompressing files. OK, so Corel has put all these capabilities into one convenient package, but the average user will never use most of the additional features. They want to zip and unzip files.

 On a recent trip, I was navigating. In a car moving at expressway speeds, the results in the search box were impossible to read because the type is so small. The address I was looking for is a house that was built in 1993. Neither it nor the surrounding community are to be found on the these maps.

 In my own area, within a six block radius, both MapPoint 2009 and Streets & Trips 2009 list four restaurants that closed three or more years ago. Another restaurant, which has been located at its current location for at least ten years, is still shown at its former location a couple of miles away.

 Such inaccuracies are unacceptable.

 For route planning, I would strongly suggest using Google Maps as your primary source or at least to check on the accuracy (or lack thereof) of the Microsoft products.

 Data mapping capability, on the other hand, is excellent. You can use "". . . an address, ZIP Code or postal code, census tract, city, metropolitan statistical area (MSA), state or province, or country. You can aggregate data by importing or linking data at one level (for example, ZIP Code) and displaying at a higher level (for example, State). Additionally, you can associate data to territories that have been defined on the map.""

 Importing is a relatively smooth process and you can use Excel, Access, Outlook contacts or any of several text formats.

 You can create territories from data or manually. Pushpin styles are limited, compared to the last version, but you can add your own.

 Once the data is mapped, you can massage it in a variety of ways, including creating routes between multiple pushpins.

 Overall, I think both Microsoft mapping products have taken a step backwards from the most recent versions. Neither MapPoint 2009 nor Streets & Trips 2009 have any features compelling enough to make the upgrade and the maps appear to be the same. I'd hold off for the next version or consider competitive products. By all means, try out the Microsoft evaluation version before you purchase this product. Make sure it works for you and that the maps are accurate enough for your needs.

It makes interpreting the changing and confusing tax forms, rules and instructions fairly easy to do.  While very helpful in deciding which numbers go where -- and this becomes easier and more automatic each year -- the biggest help for me is that there are no longer math errors in my forms.  I had to recheck each form at least twice when still doing the taxes on paper.  This is a big time saver.
You still have to keep good records, save receipts for reporting sales taxes from online purchases (yes, you do, even though many folks don't), keep donation receipts and a computer file (TurboTax does this for you) or paper file of previous tax years.  If you get audited, you will need the paper trail.
TurboTax offers a number of extra-cost services along the way as you work through the program;  it's up to the user to decide if they are worth the extra money.
Many state now offer free on-line state tax filing.  E-filing state taxes online costs extra from TurboTax.  Generally, you just have to enter numbers manually on a free state web site.  All the information is provided by the TurboTax printed forms, so you just copy the numbers requested.  This has worked well for me for several years.

It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.

There are a number of variants of this Office suite that can be found for sale here, but this review is specifically focused on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Professional-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPL2K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Professional 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version. This version is activated from the Internet by entering a product key card, and is licensed for one user on one PC. It offers the current versions of Microsoft's Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access, and Publisher applications.

Please note: I had previously installed the more basic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. This Office Professional 2013 version was for installation on a PC that had been upgraded to Windows 8.1, so it was initially more of an experiment than anything. Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office Professional 2013 suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.

 Likes:

+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless
+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed
+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email
+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed
+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way

 Rants & Irritants:

- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat

 Installation:

The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.

Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher or the other components, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.

What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.

 SkyDrive:

I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office Professional and the other Office 2013 variants, and it has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.

 Word:

The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.

Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.

 Excel:

On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.

But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, and restoring the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.

 OneNote:

This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.

 PowerPoint:

There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.

 Outlook:

There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible, and it seems to be working.

 Publisher:

I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office Professional, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.

 Access:

The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have only accessed this module a few times for conversion of some older files... and pardon the pun.

 Annoyances & Irritants:

My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the ""new"" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.

 Suggestions:

Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. This version was for installation on a PC that had recently been upgraded to Windows 8.1, and my installation went smoothly. It works well, though your results may differ from mine.

Last year, there was a considerable problem for those who discovered that they needed a more expensive tax preparation software..  Regardless, choose carefully.
Pros:
-You can go step by step to make sure you have all of you deductions, credits, or payments covered and correct, or you can select the forms you wish to use.
-One of the best features that information can be pulled from previous year's filing if done on TurboTax.  It is nice to simply check the transferred info this years end make any corrections.  You also don't have to retype the info that you use year after year. It is a good reminder for items that you entered last year and found that you will need documents.
-If you have the info from the previous year's Turbo Tax, you can compare how you did last year with this year.  It gave me a history of how my earnings stacked up with this years earnings among other things.
-If you miss something, there will be indicators to let you know where to go to make corrections or to enter missed info.
-You can stop at anytime and go back to where you were or to go to another place when you reopen.
-Does all the calculations for you and then has a review in which you will have an indication of what you need to check.
-Easy to use and to file taxes.
-There is an indicator to give you an idea if your return could have an audit.  It's not in concrete but does give valuable information.
-I have used this software since it was MacIntax.  I like it and found it to be a very effective tool when going through the tax process.
Cons:
-The ""ItsDeductabel"" doesn't have a lot of items to choose from and I found that a number of the items given to a charity were not listed.  This has been a problem for a long time.  There are not instructions on how to enter the info and continue to use the entry.  Maybe I missed it, but I knew what to do from past software.
-There is no audit help unless you pay an additional $49.99 which is close to what I paid for the software.
-Many times though the filing process there were notifications about the audit program.  It got tedious.
-Safety concerns are addressed but more personal information is required.  Some would consider this problematic.

I considered a different over-all score because some of the concerns I have still linger, like ItsDedutable.  Additionally, it does seem there are more sections are eliminated and a new charge for the item or a different more expensive level of Turbo Tax is required.  .
Considering the pros and cons, I will definitely buy TurboTax again as long as they do not eliminate the forms I need.
Will continue to buy this software.

Microsoft Streets and Trips is a comprehensive map program that lets you check routes between cities or drill down to a street-by-street view to see what an area in any given town has to offer.

Although this software is polished and packed with features, let's get some of the negatives out of the way first. Streets and Trips 2011 absolutely would not install on my Windows 7 laptop no matter how many times I tried, throwing me an error message that a critical component couldn't install before shutting itself down. I finally gave up and popped it in my Windows XP desktop, where the installation went off fine without any hiccups. I have no idea if this is a frequently encountered problem or not, but you should be aware ahead of time that you may need to end up calling tech support if you are running Windows 7.

Now on to the big issue: almost all of the program's features can be found for free online using various resources like Google Maps, Mapquest, and so on. If you don't mind going to a few different sites, you mostly don't need Streets and Trips.

Despite this major flaw, there are some aspects of the program that may still make this worth a purchase. Streets and Trips prompts you to download new construction info to help plan around detours that may slow down your planned vacation. It also helps you plan the shortest route over long distances, and lets you add your own icons and notes to locations on the map.  There is a feature to locate nearby areas of interest, such as campsites and restaurants, but most GPS units already do that for you these days anyway.

If you already have a GPS unit in your car and an Internet connection at home, there isn't a huge need for Streets and Trips. If you prefer the ability to access maps and routes without having to be online (like checking maps from your laptop in your car), or want to plan a trip at the computer and add your own notes to locations with your family, then this can be a solid investment.","Lots of nifty features, but you can already do most of this for free online",1337126400,,

Some programs offer too much flexibility (Photoshop), while others completely fall short (I'll let you fill that one in). Some provide too many additional add-on features, some provide none. With PD5 Ultra, Cyberlink has hit the sweet spot for me, as I am not a professional photographer, but want to be able to manage and edit my work.

Installation was easy and smooth on my WIndows 7 64-bit computer (yes, it's got native 64-bit support). Start-up is very quick, and the interface is excellent - a neutral grey that makes it easy to work with your photos. Importing is easy and relatively quick, letting you get to work almost right away.

There are five main sections: library, edit, slidewshow, print, and adjustment.

The Library section is great. It's basic, but really works nicely and smoothly, gathering all my photos into one easy-to-navigate and searchable place. It's often the libraries that I dislike the most in these programs, but I'm very happy with the one in PD 5.

Adjustment lets you tweak thinks like white balance, color, tone, tinge, etc - you'll be familiar with these as they're settings found in most cameras. Don't want to go manual? There are a huge number of presets available as well, for those that like to grab and go Instagram style, and they're all quite good. An excellent and well balanced set of tools overall.

Edit provides the full suite of tools one would expect; object removal, merge, frames, effects, etc. For the most part, the effects are excellent and varied. The extract tool works fairly well (using a lasso or smart-tool) and the ability to tweak the results is a welcome feature. Object removal works well too, though depending on the subject matter it can struggle from time to time.

Slideshow and print are simple and what you would expect: ways to build slideshows or set up printing.

Honestly, the program is too deep to list everything it can do in one place. Cyberlink provides a bunch of tutorials that are set up to help beginners and experts alike get the most from the program - and there's a lot to get.

It runs rock solid, looks great, has a suite of excellent tools and allows beginners to get going while more advanced users can dig deeper. A fantastic program, a great choice and now my go-to photo editing software.",A Great Photo Management Program,1389744000,19,

After installing from the disk, the activation code did not work and the product was not responding.  So I had to call tech support.  I was told that I would have to uninstall what I already had done and then go to their website and download the product and use a new activation code.  They sent me email which I printed out with the instructions.  I noticed that the directions in the email contained erroneous selections.(nice job).  Also I realized that I had installed the software while my anti-virus program was running (I don't know if this caused any problem or not).  So I turned off my anti-virus program and installed the downloaded software.  I was able to register it then.  The directions in the manual do not specify whether to turn off anti-virus before installation. Are customers just supposed to guess at this?  I would think that telling people about that would lessen the work load of their tech support.

This product is supposedly very good at finding spyware that other products do not but, it is a lot slower.  My first full scan is going on 2 hours and it says file scan 58% done total progress 28%.  Also it says ""no threats detected so far"" which is a good thing.  I try to keep my computer cleaned up.  I was told in the email that when the first full scan finishes I am then supposed to restart the computer and run a full scan again.  My experience is this software is taking a really long time to install and get my first scan results....hours and hours.....still scanning.......

Customer service technicians were friendly and helpful but, could not explain my first registration problem.  Also they did not mention anti-virus problems during installation.....I had to bring up that possibility.

Unlike many other reviewers, I have not had any problems with the upgrade, and the functionality and performance is OK, even with many years of accumulated data.

But I hate having to upgrade Quicken because:

* It costs money.  I wouldn't mind paying for occasional upgrades if they provided any real improvement, but having used Quicken for many years and gone through many upgrades, I can't remember the last time that a new version gave me a significant new capability that I use.  Just thought of one:  many years ago when they finally added multi-currency support.

* The user interface always changes between versions.  I suppose these are ""improvements"", but now I have to learn how to do things over again.  I don't mind learning new things if doing so provides new benefits, but in the case of Quicken it is usually because they have arbitrarily rearranged things.  Imagine that every so often someone came over to your house and reorganized your kitchen or garage - and then how long would it take you to find things again?

* You have to clean up all the new advertising icons that the installation litters on your desktop.

* Disappointment that YET AGAIN things that I actually need have not been addressed.  For example, the 2009 version still doesn't make handling CDs easy, yet these are very common.  I would have gladly paid the cost of the 2009 upgrade if they would have fixed this ONE thing, but no.  Maybe in Quicken 2025.

It was a nice clean Win 7 machine and (rant on) I was pleased to not have to put up with one drive, the microsoft store, or all those ""features"" that assume I want my work machines to play music and games, download ""highly rated"" apps, and all that other sperg that gets in the way of actually trying to accomplish something meaningful (rant off). That said, the only unwanted install from office 2016 appears to be one drive. This will not be a factor for people installing onto Windows 10 machines because those come pre-infected.

First a confession - I've been transitioning my WIndows machines to LibreOffice because LibreOffice appears more secure. It doesn't phone home to provide ""usage statistics,"" and most importantly it doesn't run macros such as those exploited by that ransomeware that encrypts all your files. The further you are from those macros and from any autoplay functions, the safer you are.

But... I got a chance at a review copy of Office 2016 and decided to test out a few things. The install was easy. I had to enter the product code twice though - once before creating a new MS account and once after. Odd, but it only wasted a minute. Now, those tests...

First - can it be run without ever signing into a ""Microsoft account""? I don't want to log onto Microsoft's servers or risk unintentional uploads when I'm working on confidential documents, for example, documents subject to an NDA (non-disclosure agreement). No, you do need to create (or have) a ""microsoft account"" to install the software. This isn't particularly egregious because most commercial software requires such an account. It's just part of the registration process these days. Also, the account name is an email address and that address can be -any- email address. It doesn't have to be a hotmail account or anything like that but it does have to be valid because the registration process includes you verifying the address.

Second - can I run office 2016 without being logged onto a microsoft account? Yes. I edited files after restarting the computer and without signing into that MS account. I ran these tests on a Win7 machine but believe I can do the same with a windows 10 machine having a properly installed local account.

Third - can I run office 2016 offline? Yes. I disconnected the machine from the internet and restarted it. There were no issues creating and editing documents.

I did not test moving the license from one machine to another. I've done that with office 2013 and believe that it won't be that much of a hassle.

As for office 2016 itself. It's office - a package I've used in various forms for over twenty years. It does most everything I need and the menus and stuff are pretty much where they are in office 2013. That's what is most important to me - my productivity after installing new software. To be honest, for my usage this version is the same as office 2013 because I'm running 2013 on a windows 10 machine on which I suffer OneDrive and a plethora of other annoyances as well.

Now - what is up with my OneDrive disgust? It's that I need many gigs of -secure- storage. For cloud storage, there are HIPAA compliant providers who don't weasel strange crapware onto my computer. Some of those providers piggyback off of Amazon's wondrous cloud (AWS - amazon web services is a wonder to behold). I really want the ability to uninstall OneDrive (and many other odious bits) from my work machines just for security from malware exploiting stuff I never wanted anyway.","Five stars for windows 10 machines, three for the rest",1464566400,3,

Summary
I have been using AutoCAD in one form or another since 1988 and after using CorelCAD, I can say it comes very close to being an AutoCAD replacement. While I am using it, sometimes I forget that I am using CorelCAD and not AutoCAD.  CorelCAD is really designed to be a simpler and less expensive alternative to AutoCAD. In that, it succeeds tremendously. It cuts the price of AutoCAD LT nearly in half and provides 3D capabilities not found in LT. For hard-core 3D design and drawings, a full version of AutoCAD is needed.

For graphic designers and technical illustrators who might need a tool that is more precise than a typical drawing program, or need 3D capabilities, CorelCAD should fit the bill. Some designers might already be familiar with other Corel products such as CorelDraw or CorelDesigner.",CorelCAD is great if you need a cost effective professional CAD program,1330041600,5,

IF you have a G4 or G5 Mac, Tiger is a definite. For compatible G3 systems, you may not find Tiger worthwhile.
New features and stability are once again the hallmarks of this Apple software gem.
Spotlight: A remarkably speedy context search tool. The little magnifying-glass icon at the top right of the menu bar brings up Spotlight quick search. Enter a word or phrase and instantly (once the index is built) files matching by name or content will be shown to you. When you first run your Mac using Tiger, it will automatically build a Spotlight index, which can take a few hours, depending on the number and size of the files on your disk(s). The speed at which Spotlight can find files is astounding. Even if you search for a word buried in an obscure location, Spotlight can find it.
Dashboard Widgets: These are mini-applications. Icons ""float"" above your desktop and are easily accessible. Such items as a desk clock, calendar, weather monitor and iTunes player are readily usable and hundreds more can be downloaded, both from Apple and third-parties.
RSS in Safari: Now Safari is RSS capable. You can ""subscribe"" to RSS feeds to get updates throughout the day from RSS providers. News services, weather and bargain web pages are just a few examples of providers. If an RSS feed is available, Safari will recognize this and place an RSS icon in the address bar, so you can click on it to easily access the RSS information from that site.
Tiger runs smoothly. You really need at least 512 MB of memory - a gig or more would be preferable. Once you get past the initial index creation by Spotlight, Tiger feels fast.
If you are upgrading, check with the vendors of the programs and peripherals (printers, scanners, etc.) you use to make sure these are ready for OS X 10.4. Many of the reported problems are caused by incompatibility.
If you are currently running Panther (OS X 10.3) and are undecided about upgrading, you should consider the feature list. There is no dramatic speed increase (other than Spotlight vs. Finder.)

This release does not offer any ground-breaking changes in functionality. It has the same, familiar interface and guided instruction that has been honed over the years.

The user has the option of simplifying the process by having Turbotax only present options that it feels are relevant to the preparation of the return, or the user can opt for a more thorough tour of all options (which is what I do). When there is a question about a particular deduction, the software's help is often clear and unambiguous. Installing and updating the software from one year to the next is simple, it easily imports data from the previous year to speed the process of preparation. The software will periodically update itself, which it did when I first installed the software. The updating process went without a hitch.

Last year I prepared a return for a friend using their copy of Turbotax, and when I received the final amount owed, it seemed wrong.

You can use OpenOffice, which is a free open source office suite.  or, of course, you can run the MS Office suite on your Mac sans-windows using Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac.

Personally, I do need to use Word and PowerPoint and Excel both at home and at work, and it's especially nice to have a native app, because I don't like running a VM if I don't have to (maybe if my laptop were newer I wouldn't mind letting a VM run idle all the time, but I so rarely use it that it seems silly).  Also, VM's tend to drain batteries on laptops, so I like to avoid using one when I'm not plugged in to the wall.  Interestingly, I often needed something other than Office 2007 for Windows because everyone else in the world had upgraded past 2007, and 2007 doesn't open the newer .docx file formats without downloading converters ... I've used Apple's Pages, Apple's TextEdit, and Sun's OpenOffice and of course MS Office 2008 for Mac.  To make a long story short: there are a lot of options and I've tried them all.  So read on:

FEATURES: Just what you'd expect: every feature, button, option, pallet, style, etc is available.  They're also very accessible (not a UI masterpiece, but since we've all been trained to the Office UI since birth, you'll be able to find everything you need). 5 stars.

FILE COMPATIBILITY: No problems that I've found.  Yet.  I'd used older Office:Mac versions and never ran into file formatting issues there either, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt that I'll have a similar experience.  Especially considering that MS now uses a fairly well documented xml file format (hence the new 'x' at the end of all your file names).  5 stars.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE: Launches fairly quickly, works well, scrolls smoothly, etc.  Overall the app performs to the standards you'd expect. A bit slow opening large files (I wrote a 340 page book - and it opened in a little under 20 seconds.  In fact you should buy it, just for reference ;-)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cluck-Murder-Most-Fowl/dp/1419682644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cluck: Murder Most Fowl</a>&nbsp;... anyway - 4 stars.

PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY: Here I have a major complaint.  I'm running a MacBook Pro with a 2.33GHz Core 2 Duo, and 2GB of RAM.  I'm a computer guy, I work for an information security company, I keep things patched and updated and running clean ... and ever since installing this, my system has been running slower.  I should have known better than to provide an admin password during install, as there's no reason that an office suite needs that level of access.  When Word or PowerPoint is running, it seems to get worse.  There are always 2 Microsoft processes running, one of which consumes about 2% of my CPU no matter what.  This is bearable overall, but it earns the product a 1-star rating for this category.

DOCUMENT DESIGN: Just in case anyone is looking for Word to create flyers and such, I want to say that if you are, look elsewhere.  Word is notoriously bad at formatting anything other than text-based documents.  If you own a Mac and need these types of features, get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iWork-09/dp/B0014X2UAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iWork '09</a>&nbsp;and use Pages, which is great at creating vivid and lively brochures, resumes, menus, etc.  I'm not providing a star rating for this category, because Word should never be evaluated in this category by a Mac user (and this is Office for Mac, after all).

ENTOURAGE: A decent enough mail app, but again, why not just use Mail?  It comes with your Mac, and in about three months from now (in Sep 2009) Mail will support the few remaining Exchange features that Entourage can handle (and even entourage doesn't handle exchange accounts that well, IMO).  So again, no star rating here: only use entourage if your IT guy makes you. Wait, this is the Home & Student edition, so unless you're Bill Gates, you aren't running an exchange server in your home.  And if your school is running exchange, transfer.  Quickly.

As like other virus tools, you need to uninstall old virus protection tool from your computer before installing the Norton 360 V5. Installation is exceptionally fast and within a minute or two, Norton 360 V5 is up and running.

The scans are done in the background. And it DOESN'T slow my PC while the scan is running. Computer feels the same way as it were stock. Also, it scans fast, much faster than my previous McAfee.

No major annoying popups. Only one I've encountered are ""High Resource Usage"", which I confirmed high system memory usage with window task manager.

Parental Controls are mediocre.

Norton's link scanner is a special feature. It not only tests links before you go there, but it also is capable of scanning your social media (like FaceBook) wall for links posted there, to ensure that the links lead to safe places. This is a big plus for people who are active on that social media sites. A useful feature !!

This version comes with a startup manager to help you to disable startup programs that you don't use or that you don't want to start up.

You cannot choose a disk you want to scan in a VirusScan GUI. If you want to scan just a particular volume, a folder or even a file, you can right-click on it in window explorer and choose the Scan option from the Norton sub-menu.

If there is any particular weakness in Norton360, it's the ""Backup"" feature which is very basic. And the 2GB free backup space is nearly useless. This is not a replacement for more capable backup utilities like Acronis TrueImage, or the Norton Ghost.

Right now, though, it is the faster and most fabulous Windows OS I have ever used, except it doesn't have Word for free like the Vista on my Dell laptop.

Okay, I'm reviewing the free download from Microsoft, which anyone can get for any device with home versions of Windows 7 or 8 on it.  Months ago, I reserved Windows 10 for my Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 7.  After reserving it, my Toshiba started having problems, especially on start up.  It could take me sometimes 10 minutes to get online! Firefox froze constantly, Chrome was only slightly better, and IE would hardly ever work at all.  I suspected the problems were due to Windows 10 either being downloaded or tested out on my laptop in the background. At one point, I even stopped the automatic Windows Updates so I could see what was being installed.  Unfortunately, I forgot I stopped automatically updating and when I went to Windows Updates this week, saw that I had countless critical updates.  I also had only one choice to choose--Install Windows 10.  They didn't even send me a notice it was my time to do so, after I had been waiting for the notice for months.

Well, I hit the install button, left my laptop plugged in and went about my day.  When I came home and checked the download in the late afternoon, it said it had failed.  The error code suggested the laptop lost connection to the internet.  Thus, I started again and the download amount immediately went to 49% . . . but then it went down to 0%.  I then decided to try to do individual installation of all the critical updates for Windows 7, pushed cancel, and discovered I no longer could view the individual updates.  My only choice was to choose installing Windows 10 again, which I did, and my download amount immediately became 90%.  It then quickly went to 100%, the installation started and finished in no time, and I, at long last, had Windows 10.

It started off with some settings questions that seemed like nothing but spying to me, so I chose ""off"" for all of them.  That didn't seem to slow down Windows 10 at all or mess it up or whatever.  Now, when I go online, I'm online in usually 60 seconds or so.  Firefox, Chrome and Windows Edge, which replaced IE, are all working well.  I can go from one browser to another with no problems.

I got this for my first and third graders to learn how to type.  The third grader has had a few basic lessons at school, and this program is working well with what he's doing there.  He already knew the ""home keys"", and so the lessons on learning the letters that go with the fingers were perfect for him.  He was already doing some of that, so MB is great reinforcement and extra practice for him.  He is improving steadily, and is starting to use proper form when using the computer.

The first grader on the other hand, has never had any typing lessons before.  The concept of the home keys is new to him, and it isn't really emphasized very much by MB.  He rushed through to get to the actual typing lessons, but was just using whichever fingers were easy for him to do *fast*, so I stopped him.

- The videos that show you what each lesson is about - seem to be there just so they can say they have videos, because they really are just showing the lesson.  Watch the video, do the lesson, same difference!

Unfortunately, Intuit did its usual half-hearted, half-designed job with this feature, and it's quite disappointing:
1.  You can't sync investment accounts.  The old investing.quicken.com site is very limited, not worth using.  (For example, you can't see simple consolidated views of your investments, can't run basic reports. etc.)
2.  The sync from the desktop isn't automatic, and takes a long time.  If you're used to other online products that sync to the desktop (think Dropbox & Google Drive as two very popular examples, there are many others), you will find this clunky & old-tech.  Everytime you open Quicken, it will tell you you made changes, whether you did or not, and suggest that you sync.  This should be an automated, behind the scenes process, it's not hard.
3.  The alerts are rather dumb, and they're essentially hard-coded.  You can't create your own rules, and you can't even do a lot with the built-in rules (you can just pick some parameters from a limited list).  You can't delete them all either, if you consider them dumb and pointless.  Again, not hard to do a lot better.

There are no significant improvements in reporting, or in investment analysis.  If you look at the ""What's new in 2013"" page, you see mobile, alerts, and ""more flexible budgeting"", whatever that means.

There is a tweak to how accounts show up in the nav bar, where you can put some accounts in the ""Separate"" list, which means ""show but don't include with main set of accounts"".  This is mildly useful.  There's also a feature to mark an account ""closed"", also slightly useful -- in theory.  These account still show up in the list of accounts when you're doing a transfer between investment accounts!  Clearly someone forgot what the word ""closed"" might mean.

Installation was almost automatic. The license lets you install the software from their website with just one key. You can then manage all protected devices from your online account and move protections around as your collection of devices changes.

Norton 360 offers a password management feature, which is really handy. This feature stores usernames, passwords and credit card numbers and then fills in the information when opening your password-secured websites. That is very convenient if you have several online accounts.

Additional PC features include tune-up, backup and restore utilities. Norton includes a proprietary two-way PC firewall. Windows already comes with a firewall, but some people like the idea of having their firewall and anti-malware software come from a single source. The PC Tuneup cleans up Windows temporary files, Internet Explorer temporary files, Internet Explorer history cleanup, startup manager, registry cleanup and disk optimization.

The PC portion includes parental controls management. You can block access to sites that you don't want kids to visit and you can track where they go on the internet.

Yes, you can manage photos but it's not 'effortlessly'. My main problem with most tools that offer to do content 'management' on my behalf is that they claim to know the 'right way' which is usually their own rigid way of imposing 'order' into my private universe and it tends to clash with 'my way'. A tool unable to compromise if not let me keep 'my way' of organizing things becomes an annoyance and the opposite of 'useful' because all it does is slow me down. PhotoDirector's content management model clashes with mine and reconciliation may not be possible or it didn't happen after a few weeks of use. Its insistence of swallowing all my photos into what it calls 'projects' and 'albums' might make sense if you get PhotoDirector the day you start taking digital shots but it's a pain if you already have 5000 or 10,000 photos around, already organized by some other criteria. I expected more flexibility.

Yes, photo processing can be fast but, as always, there is a correlation between speed and quality and touching the program-provided magic wands that should do auto adjustments for the better don't always produce a better photo. In fact, the better your original shot was, the higher the odds are that you get something worse if you try to process it with the auto options. Yes, creative photo editing is possible but you don't get half the tools that, let's say, Photoshop would give you. And there's, of course, the learning curve whenever dealing with an unfamiliar user interface but that can be overcome in time. PhotoDirector is quite Okay as an editing tool, it really is and it's possible to get better and better results as you become more familiar with the tools.

Sadly, the photo editor is tightly integrated with the 'manager' part meaning that if you have no use for the manager, the only way to 'liberate' your contents from PhotoDirector's rigid structure is to grab your work as soon as it's done and move it someplace where your photos are organized the way you want them organized.

Overall, the package is a pretty nice but not 'pro' quality photo editing tool that's too tightly integrated into a photo management scheme I won't accept. Three stars, exclusively on the editor's merits should be a fair rating.","Photo editor, yes. Content manager, no, no, no",1387324800,,

I started with their most involved set when I owned my own business and had stock investments and have been gradually working my way down as I have worked my way into retirement.  I now have a fairly simple tax return and so the Deluxe version works well for me now.  Since I live in a state with no income tax, this version which is a Federal return version only works great for me.  Here is what I liked:

  1.  Loads quickly on a Windows 8 Pro machine.

  2.  Found my prior years filings without issue and so preloaded in the appropriate information for me.

  3.  Offers e-mail updates for when Federal forms will be available (due to various issues this year, the Federal forms are not yet complete.  This is not a Turbo Tax issue, it is a Federal Government issue.)

  4.  Software is included to help you evaluate the appropriate values for donated goods.

  5.  Allows you to either enter information on your own or to have guidance from TurboTax.

What I did not like so much:

  1.  The constant pitch to upgrade the product to the next higher level.

  2.  The lack of a program to provide discounted software to people who use their software year after year.  Why do I have to go to Amazon or Costco to obtain the software at a discount instead of being able to purchase it direct from the company at a discount?

I have to declare myself thoroughly delighted with both of them.  The BitDefender gives perhaps a slightly better bargain for the buck, partly because it offers very slightly larger features and partly because it provides a year year license while the Trend Micro provides only one.  In fact, comparing the BitDefender with all other security programs, it just might be the best bargain.

The one thing that I don't like about the BitDefender as opposed to the Trend Micro equivalent is that my computer seems to drag a bit downloading some pages compared to the one with Trend Micro.  This might be attributable to the computers.  Some antivirus programs I've used really slow the computer down and make looking at pages on the Internet a drag.  If BitDefender slows down my computer more than Trend Micro does, it is only by the slightest of margins.

At first, I did my taxes using spreadsheets.  Later, after using Quicken for keeping my finances, I used TurboTax for many many years.  I have filed all the common forms and many less common schedules since for awhile I had an in-home business.

Setting up Norton 360 3.0 was simple.  The new version deleted the old version and installed itself.  Installation took about 15 minutes, making me reboot several times.

After it was up and running, it performed well.  It immediately found a Trojan without my having performed an initial scan.  This Trojan was probably lurking on my computer, which the old version of Norton completely was unaware.

Then, I set up the back up software.  Norton scanned for important documents and found files I would likely want to back up (images/documents/music/etc).  I was to able choose which of these files I wanted to back up and given options on where I wanted them backed up - to an external server, external hard drive, DVD burner, and so forth.  Included in 360 is 2GBs of sever space from Norton.  Obviously, this isn't enough to back up images and music, but it is enough to back up important documents.

Next, I scanned for viruses.  Norton found a few minor issues and deleted the malicious files.

Finally, I defragged my hard drive, which took several hours.

I ordered this software to specifically use in my home theater setup that includes a 65"" Panasonic Plasma, Denon AV receiver, a WDTV Live Hub, PS3, and a networked PC running a raid array containing my DVD/video library, music, pictures and the like. This is my first interaction with PowerDVD since the early 2000's when it came pre-loaded on my Compaq desktop. Clearly Cyberlink's intention is to make PowerDVD the centerpiece of your home theater experience. This software is complete overkill if you're just looking to playback Blu-ray's, DVD's and do some streaming on a laptop and is really geared toward the serious home theater owner.

--------------------
SETUP:

Installing the software on my Windows 7 desktop is about as easy as it gets and is standard fare. Pop in the disc, follow the on-screen guide and finally use the included product code to register the software with Cyberlink. To their credit Cyberlink actually included a full manual in the box with their software which is something that is becoming increasingly rare with software. This makes looking up features, answering the, ""what does this button do?"" questions very easy. After setup and launching the software it performed a quick scan of my hard drives and indexed my media files as well as presenting a number of video tutorials about the software.

--------------------
FEATURES:

Oh boy, there's a lot to cover here!

First, I suppose is the myriad of supported movie formats including: BD-R (various specs), BDROM Profile 2.0 (BD-Live), BDROM Profile 5.0 (BD-3D), AVCREC, AVCHD, DVD-Video, DVD-VR, DVD+VR, VCPS, VCD, SVCD, CD. There are even more supported video formats (I'll list some of the more popular one's only): AVC, AVI, DIVX, H264, MKV, MOV, MP4, MP4V, MPE, MPEG, MPG, TIVO, WM, WMV. Music formats include: AAC, AC3, ADTS, APE, AOB, DTS, FLAC, M4A, MID, MKA, MP2, MP3, MPA, OGG, RMI, WAV, WMA

For a full listing of supported formats (movies, video, music & pictures): [...]

TrueTheater HD:
Cyberlink touts this as their DVD upscaling and Blu-ray enhancing software. I've used various upscaling DVD players over the years and the effect here is similar. Don't expect Blu-ray quality out of TrueTheater and honestly I'm okay with regular DVD 480p quality for my older movies.

TrueTheater:
PowerDVD features a variety of other enhancement features like TrueTheater Motion that tries to smooth video by enhancing the frame rate. TrueTheater Stretch that stretches a 4:3 frame to 16:9. TrueTheater Denoise & Stabilizer that are geared toward home movie takers. In short a lot of features that you may never use unless you are really, really into tinkering with video quality and getting the absolute most out of your videos and movies.

For my uses I focused more on the ability to playback Blu-ray discs, video files on an internal raid and external NAS. With these functions PowerDVD performs fantastically.

--------------------
POTENTIAL BLOAT:

There is a lot to this software. So much ""extra"" stuff that I'm tempted to call it bloat. YouTube, Flickr and the now standard Facebook plug-in are alive and present here. I have no interest in connecting to Facebook on my home theater as I already have a myriad of devices that do the job better. The YouTube integration is admirable but still works better from a browser. Flickr is the interesting feature in the chance that you store a lot of photos on that site and like to view them on your PC/home theater.

I also did not utilize the 3D or the 3D conversion of 2D content features as it's not something that's appealing to me. Similarly I did not try out the 4K features as I don't have compatible content.

Cyberlink also offers apps for Android & iTunes compatible devices that allow you to stream content and have basic remote control functions. Again a feature that I didn't use because of redundancy with apps/programs that are already in place in my home.

--------------------
Closing:

PowerDVD is really geared toward someone looking for an all-in-one solution and doesn't want to bounce around from different media players for different content. For folks who already have established processes and software that you use and are familiar with PowerDVD will offer less value and thus be a harder buy at its premium price.",Expensive for What it Does,1377129600,7,

It is what I typed my first reports in.  I craft my first term papers and kept notes in it, and did some of my first statistical analysis and graphing using Quattro Pro.  Then I got a real job and joined the corporate world and found the ubiquity of Microsoft Office.  And I had to learn Word, Excel, and Power Point etc.  And while Microsoft Office is the standard, and you find it almost everywhere, I find myself missing WordPerfect and the other programs often.
WordPerfect is still and amazingly powerful word processor.  It may not look as pretty as Word, but it has a lot less hiccups and once you learn the basic workings it makes it much easier to format documents then Word.  Word in all its wisdom to try and figure out what it is you are trying to do does a lot of auto-formatting and getting it to stop can be tough, WordPerfect makes that much easier and much more straight forward, I imagine that is one reason it is so like by the legal profession.
Quattro Pro has all the processing power of Excel in my opinion, pretty much every function you have in Excel you have in QP.  But it does have access to the add-in that you get with Excel, and so you lose some points there.  But if you don't have any fancy add-ins you can do your spreadsheet work and save in Excel format and everything works just the same on the other side.

I was eventually able to work through these issues but know that few people would have stuck with it as long as I did if returning it was an option.

Once installed, and some time taken to master the navigation and learn the tools, the program is a very good photo editing package. The ""Smart Carver"" is a very cool tool for removing unwanted objects in pictures and it usually works fairly well.

Many months ago when I did my first install, I could not activate the software after I entered my product key, because there was no activate button. I had to call customer support to find out how to activate the software. I had to hit the ALT key + N, then I could not close the activation screen. I had to call them back,only to find out that I had to hit the ALT + F4 key to close the activation screen. This is not a major problem then, but is now, because about 6 months has passed, and it is still not fixed!  I know this, because I recently downloaded the latest Version of Pure, and the same problem still exists.  Thereafter my installations on my laptop and desktop and many new builds, I noticed my WIFI on my laptop had an exclamation point and limited connection (NO CONNECTION AT ALL). This has gone on for months, and I went through 2 Uverse modems, and several calls to HP, and a new Ralink WIFI card, to no avail. I finally got lucky in a Google search late one night where the guy had the same problem until he disabled the Kaspersky NDIS 6 filter in WIFI Properties. Kaspersky sent me new settings which they said would fix the problem, and of course it DID NOT! They then sent me report maker to send in a report about my system and their Virus program, which I did. Then I get this email from them wanting to close the ticket without a fix, because they had not heard from me. It was Kaspersky Support - Follow-up: 315405243. Well that is not the end of it.  My desktop is hard wired to the network. I brought it out of the sleep mode only to find that wonderful yellow exclamation point on my hard wired connection. Of course, I knew immediately that it was the Kaspersky NDIS 6 filter, which I immediately disabled, and that ended the dropout problems on both computers. I have been installing this program on many of my new builds, and now I have to go back and correct this problem on all of them, because Kaspersky can't seem to find a fix to either of the above problems, and I do not know what exactly it is that this filter does. Because of their poor customer service, and their total lack of interest, I do not recommend this program to any user running both Windows 8 or 7. Kaspersky, you have lost a long term customer. I have switched to Vipre Internet Security 2014, totally because of your lack of interest, poor support and no fixes for long term problems.

It really does not matter to me now if you fix the WIFI dropout problem
with your NDIS 6 Filter, and having to hit ALT +N to activate the Pure
software, and because of your lack of interest in repairing these issues, I
have uninstalled the software and switched to VIPRE. So as far as I am
concerned, you can close the ticket, and you have lost a customer for
good. You know, these issues have gone on for months with no
resolution, and I build 20 to 25 extreme machines per month. Since you
obviously have no interest in repairing you software, I will make sure
this issue gets around the industry.

While I did find this program to be much more stable than the older version, I did have it fail to render one video. All I had to do was close the program, open the project up and export again. That only happened once after many successful renders, so I don't think it will happen again.

 The total install is about 3.8GB and though the downloading was pretty quick, the very slow install process failed the first time, throwing up a message that I should call Corel Technical Support. No error codes, no explanation, no nothing that an experienced user would use for troubleshooting before getting involved with a probable wait for telephone support.

 So I relied on instinct and tried to install a second time, which also took a very long time, but it installed without issue.

 On an i7 based computer with an Nvida GPU, 16GB RAM and a 7200RPM drive, launching Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 invokes a static splash screen that cannot be minimized or sent to another layer. The VideoStudio splash screen takes over you machine, keeping you from doing anything else, for more than 3 minutes! Absolutely unbelievable. After taking my  enforced nap, I checked in Preferences to see if the splash screen for an option to not have it launch. Nope.

 The next time, I wil have a stop watch handy when I launch VideoStudio, but I think the three minutes plus is reasonably  accurate.

 Unreal.

 I checked Windows 10 Task Manager and my system is relatively clean, no impediments to Corel executing quickly.

 But everything about this program seems to be slow. Dragging clips from the media bin to a track is slow. There is a noticeable delay between clicking the lay  start button and the video playing. Transitions take time. Everything takes time, way too much time.

 I run Adobe Premier Pro, Adobe Premier Elements, Cyberlink PowerDirector, TrakAxPC, Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 and other video programs on this computer and none run as slow as Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9.

 As a result of this sluggish performance, I have to give up testing it for today  I just don't have that much time. I will come back to it later when I can endure the long waits. I will say that the program was stable during all this: no crashes, just incredibly slow performance. And the idea of a static splash screen that you cant dismiss is pathetically archaic.

My wife and I have always been pleased with having the larger screen and greater navigation control of a GPS program on our notebook as opposed to a small dashmount GPS.

If the kids say they are hungry, you ask Street Atlas where the closest restaurant you love is on your route and it will spit out a list of options.  Then you can call ahead and set up reservations because Delorme gives you the phone numbers as well as the address to the restaurant.

I have used both Delorme and Microsofts mapping programs and I am much happier with Delorme due to the ease of use of GPS navigation.  Also, I have found that Delorme's routes are much more intuitive to road conditions and always seemed to get us to our destination faster than Microsoft.

To be fair, though, it was in the early days of hidef video editing and all the bugs had not been worked out yet; I also have a more powerful system now.  I was pleasantly surprised when I dug into the program, I've been a Pinnacle Studio and Sony Vegas user for  years.  Without having to read extensively in the manual I was able to create a short high definition video complete with effects.  I'm not overly fond of the surrogate AVCHD files the program creates, but it does have the definite advantage over Pinnacle Studio (which has to render each high definition clip as you place them on the timeline)--they are good enough to give you a rough idea of what your project will look like when created.  The editor has enough advanced features to keep the intermediate and novice editor busy for a while, and it has many good output options and disk making capabilities.  The video rendered relatively quickly and I was quite satisfied with the output in the .mt2 format especially for upload to Vimeo and YouTube.

I did have some trouble with  Smart Sound, however, I was unable to use the free music I had for it in my library.  This may have been because I had Roxio Creator 2012 on my computer as well and could not reinstall Smart Sound with the program without possibly effecting Roxio.  You can buy Smart Sound music to use in your projects, but it is very expensive--were I doing videos comercially for a profit I could justify the costs, but the average hobbiest is better offer trying to find some other sources of royalty free music.

The reaason I've given the product 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was generally dissatisfied with the automated movie output.  I never use automated movie features in other products because I am a control freak and want to control my projects from beginning to end.  I did try the automated movie output for the purpose of this review and did not like the way it showed video clips as separate files and did not transition them together, I found the themes cheesy, and the slideshow created with still images displayed the images too long.  If you are a fan of automated movies, I'd reccomend Pinnacle Studio over this program--it has nicer themes and splices  video clips together with interesting transitions.  If I had dug deeper, I might have been able to wield more control, but found that the Magic Movie dialogue to be less than intuitive--so my suggestion is that if this feature is important to you download the demo and try it first.

Like most recent consumer level video editors Power Director 10 Ultra gives you the ability to create 3D movies that can be viewed on any computer or TV with red/cyan glasses.  Since I don't have a camera that shoots 3D footage I can't comment on how well it handles the new 3D camera output formats.  It also comes with a nice pair of 3D glasses.  Since 3D is not important to me currently I did not experiment with creating a 3D film, but if it is important to you, again I reccomend downloading the demo of the program before buying.

All in all this is a good video editor when compared to others I've used.  If you're just starting out with video creation I don't think you could do better than this program.  I reccomend it over Adobe Premier Elements, and it offers more controls and flexibility than Pinnacle Studio, but is not as difficult to learn to use as Sony Vegas Movie Studio.

Plus, it's not like the previous versions of Peachtree where payroll and taxes were inclusive to the software. These are now seperate purchases and are quite costly and are annual subscription based softwares as well.

There are several different fees that are required to use the full potential of the software, which they market to you pretty consistenly.

So if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage.

The big disappoint is that this information isn't disclosed here on Amazon. However, it is disclosed on the box.

Here is the information verbatim on the box:

""Important Note:
When upgrading to Sage 50 Accounting 2013 from Sage Peachtree 2012 and earlier versions, you will no longer be able to manually manipulate the tax tables within Sage 50. You will now be required to have a Sage 50 Payroll Solution or Sage Business Care Gold or Platinum subscription, in order for your Sage 50 solution to calculate taxes, benefits and liabilities on payroll checks. In addition, a subscription will be required to access payroll tax forms and to use the Exception, Payroll Tax, Tax Liability, Vacation and Sick reports or any custom reports based on these reports. Without a subscription, you will only be able to manually enter the tax, benefits, and liability figures on payroll checks and run payroll reports not previously listed.""

This information and the new working matrix of Sage 50 should be disclosed on here so that those who are wanting to purchase this software, they have full disclosure of the software and what is required to use the software.

If you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget.

People ask me all the time what they should use, and I want to be able to really give them an answer. While this wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. It did catch spyware on a computer that had had antivirus protection beforehand! The main issue is how slow the software is. I didn't notice it really slowing the computer, but the scans were very slow.

The good:
1. Found spyware right away--now it was just a shopping toolbar, but it found it outside of a scan and gave me the option to take care of it right away.
2. The install was easy.
3. I found nothing in the menus that were confusing. The menus are set out out pretty well. If you have to do something (like click on a plus symbol for more info), it's usually said on the screen what you have to do.
4. Things were setup about like I would want them right out of the box. There is a game mode and it turns off after 4 hours by default.

The bad:
1. Took forever to install. I installed it on 3 computers: an xp dual-core, a vista dual-core, and a brand new windows 7 machine. It took over 45 minutes each time! I don't even begin to know why it took so long to install, and the bar fills up multiple times so there really is no way to judge if you can leave it for 10 minutes or 2 hours or what.
2. Full system scans take forever. If you leave your computes on overnight or whatever this may not be an issue, but they just take hours!
3. For some reason manual update is hidden away in the menus.

So overall, if you want your antivirus and antispyware package in one, I think you do get better antispyware protection with webroot. But because of how slow the scans are, I still suggest Norton Antivirus 2011 over this. If you need antispyware protection, the free version of malwarebytes or superantispyware works great if you're willing to run manual scans and their pay versions aren't expensive if you want scheduled scans.

So far out of 2011 software I've tried I rate them:
1 Star:
Bitdefender 2011--the file-sharing it does was a deal-breaker for me (beyond continued issues from previous version)
3 Stars:
This

QuickBooks has the small business accounting software market almost to itself, although mostly on Windows.  Apple's market share in computing significantly increased during my hiatus and there has been a shift towards the internet, mobile devices and, more recently, the cloud.  Whether QuickBooks will fully embrace these changes has yet to be seen.  Intuit provides more services to small businesses than it used to and it is even teaming up with Bank of America to integrate software and financial services, although whether that will benefit small business owners, it is also too soon to know.

The basic software seems to be the same with tweaks and incremental improvements rather than a complete rebuild from the ground up.  It still doesn't do everything for everyone but it will allow the majority of small businesses owners to take care of most of the day-to-day bookkeeping and allow an accountant to use the files to submit a tax return, and at a very reasonable cost compared to what this would have cost just a few decades ago.

Some of the newer features are being able to have multiple users with access restricted only to certain functions such as payroll, tracking project time and expenses and billing them to clients, and exporting report data to Microsoft Excel.  Incredibly, batched importing of online banking transactions is new for 2012.  The overall look and feel has also been improved for Mac users.

Still, the Mac version does not have all the capabilities and features of the Windows version and it doesn't seem that this will change.  Apple computers can now run Windows and Windows-compatible software and the two operating systems have also become more similar.  So for most small business owners with Apple computers, the real question is not whether to use QuickBooks but whether to use the Windows or Mac version.  Ironically, at a time when Apple operating systems are gaining market share, starting out on or switching over to QuickBooks for Windows is now a much better option for Mac users than it ever has been.",Incremental improvements,1320537600,13,

Ive spent years trying out and uninstalling Norton.  Id get corrupted files and unexplained crashes, so I was not a Norton fan.

I actually have not put it on mine yet, mostly because he has a lot more experience with CorelDraw than I do.  (He's the official family geek.)

First of all, the program comes with a downloadable version, so if you don't have a dvd drive on your computer, you are still going to be able to use this.  Many laptops today just don't include an optical drive.

The new feature that had him the most excited was the font manager.  It can tell you if you have duplicate fonts, whether they are fully installed, protected fonts, etc.  This wasn't on the previous version, and it is a huge aid for someone who uses a lot of fonts for websites, etc. In any other program, being able to manage the fonts and see all of the ones you have installed is nearly impossible and certainly going to take a lot more time.
  He was nearly giddy about this program, as there is apparently no other program that is nearly as efficient at managing fonts.  While I found it interesting, it wasn't something that got me nearly as excited as he was.

You can also get downloadable software for photo managing using RAW files called Aftershot.  This was another feature that had him drooling with joy.  This is a feature that you apparently need to download soon after activating your software.

This is a much more affordable option for managing graphics than any other brand.  It's not a subscription to use the software, it's software you actually BUY and install on your computer and you can use it until your computer is so antiquated that the Smithsonian Institute wants it for a display.  No additional fees or what he calls ""hostage fees"".

For those who don't always have internet access, you do have to have an internet connection to activate the software, but you also have to connect again once a month to maintain your activation.  This is apparently to prevent piracy, and is only a minor inconvenience.  Most people are going to access the internet that often without special effort, even if they are working offline.

It's also designed for Windows 10, which is probably the most used OS courtesy of the release method chosen by Microsoft.  I think all of our computers are actually running it, although we may still have one or two old laptops that just have 7 or 8 on them.  Not all programs are necessarily ideal in 10, so seeing this is addressing that issue head on is nice.

When we got this software, my husband had actually just finished a trial of the software, so he's been playing with it for a bit when he had time.  He really is a bit too excited about the font manager portion (okay, I'm boring, I just use like three different fonts, and don't really care about all of those others.  Then again, I like spending time with an old fashioned pen and a bottle of ink on paper practicing lettering by hand.)

CorelDraw is really great software.  For me, the fact that they have training videos is an asset, as I have decided that I should learn to be better at computer graphics and photo manipulation than I am, even if I just want to clean up shots of my granddaughter and daughter.  I'll confess that I really had not been spending much time with graphics software in the past decade, and I'm seriously behind the times in terms of using it.  The interface is user friendly, and the learning curve does not look like I'm attempting to climb Mount Everest in a pair of flip flops.  (That's IF I can get him to hush up as he goes on forever and ever about how wonderful the font manager portion is.)  It might be kind of neat to figure out how to draw and paint in a computer graphics program, without the mess and clutter of paintbrushes and acrylic paint tubes (my usual medium).

I'm excited about having this software and getting it installed on my laptop.  I'm creative in the 3d world, so expanding it into the cyber world would be an interesting and exciting process. Best of all, it is a much more economical option compared to Adobe's offering.  It may seem expensive, but I think it will be worth the expense for anyone who is serious about computer graphics.",I am in love,1462492800,2,

So when Apple offered to let me play with a review copy of Office for Mac I thought it would be fun to see how it compares to Office on Windows.

The Mac version provides good compatibility and pretty much the same functionality as the Windows version, and manages to do it in a Mac-style that won't have you always feeling like you're running a Windows app.

As a few seconds reading these reviews will tell you, Microsoft was unable to provide Visual Basic for Applications support in this version, so if you're on an older version and have dependencies on this then you probably don't want to upgrade, but for the rest of us who don't write applications  in Office, it's probably not an issue.

So what really is there to say about Office for the Mac?

Well, it's Office. For the Mac.

For a lot of people this probably tells you all you need to know if you're moving over to the Mac for the first time or working in an environment where Office is the de-facto standard for document interchange. If you're used to office on Windows, this will give you the closest experience in terms of functionality you're familiar with, and it does it in a very ""Mac"" way.

If you know you need it, or you know you hate it (or both) then you're probably not reading this review. For everyone else, Office for Mac is a complete office application suite that works well in the Mac environment. Chances are it will offer 10x the features that you'll ever use, just like its Windows counterpart.

To use a restaurant analogy, this bundling of stripped-down photo and video applications reminds me of the fixed-price appetizer-entree-dessert bundling that restaurants sometimes offer to entice diners to eat a meal there at a more moderate price than had they chosen whatever they wanted from the a la carte menu.  The bundle of applications included in this suite is actually very usable for photo and video beginners: VideoStudio Express for video editing, PaintShop Photo Express for performing basic one-click-does-it-all sorts of photo editing, WinDVD for playing DVDs and videos, DVD Factory for burning DVDs, and Instant Viewer photo viewer/browser.

For photo or video beginners, I rate this collection of applications that is oriented towards spoon-fed ease of use 4 stars.  However, my main reservation (no restaurant pun intended) to this collection of software is that if you are either an intermediate or (especially) advanced user of photo or video editing software, or if you are a beginning user of this software who wants to progress into advanced ""power user"" levels of features, you will soon hit a wall with the limited set of tools and functionality that the VideoStudio Express and PaintShop Photo Express, in particular, provide.

If you foresee yourself diving more into advanced both photo and video editing capabilities, I would skip a bundle like this and head straight for the higher learning curve, and likewise higher ability, of Adobe Photoshop Elements or even Corel's own CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4 is far more powerful, albeit more expensive.  But in a way, the ""you get what you pay for"" law still applies here.  There are likewise far better video editing software out there, both commercial and free.

I have had three computers brick with Windows 8.  Two were brand new laptops and one was a one and a half year old desktop PC.  All three had the same issue.  When booting up for the first time everything seemed to go fairly well, once logged in things were a little laggy and unstable and required updates.  Once the updates were almost all installed it began doing the required restarts and thats where the problems bagan.  Some of the updates were broken causing an infinate restart loop until eventually (sometimes days later) it would say there was an error installing updates reverting to previous installation.....that was good except for it never did revert and only stayed on the ""reverting to previous version"" screen forever.  I returned the two laptops for a refund and had to buy a new PC even microsoft support said to return them and they were toast.  Garbage.

It is generally not hard to install, though some systems may have programs installed that interfere, so it's best to close out everything else that is running before starting the installation. If you have X5 and are satisfied then there's not much reason to upgrade - Winzip, the program that began as popular shareware, is an addition to X6 that most people won't really need. WordPerfect Office is compatible with MS Office/Word formats so you can exchange files between the two, and there is similar functionality. Each suite has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the user. WordPerfect is more affordable since it doesn't have the market dominance that MS Office has. For those really on a tight budget there is the OpenOffice program that can be obtained for free online from Sun MicroSystems. That one handles the basics well but lacks a lot of extra features and options that you can get in the commercial Office suites. For those who are in need of a suite that includes resources for word processing, presentations, spreadsheets, file management, Internet integration, and more, I would recommend considering WP Office X6 - if you have a recent PC model. If your PC is pretty old it might not handle the latest software so well, so you should check the recommended system specs before getting the software.

You're immediately thrown into the language you want to learn -- there's no English allowed. This sounds daunting, but the software starts you off at such a rudimentary level it isn't intimidating.

I really like how the program keeps track of what areas I'm botching and pulls me back into those areas for more work. I also like the pronunciation practice via the included headset, although I can't verify it's always catching me when I'm mispronouncing things. To my ear I'm doing OK, but my ear isn't the best, hence my use of this program. If I'm pronouncing things badly and the program isn't always catching my errors, I'm not sure how I'd know, if you see what I mean. My hope is that I can nail the rudiments of Italian and get a good grip on simple conversations using Rosetta Stone before trying to find people to practice with/on, thus keeping my embarrassment factor low.

Thankfully, the app employs a good variety of interactive methods (matching pictures to sentences, writing caption for photos, hearing words and phrases pronounced correctly by native speakers, etc.) so the ""by rote"" factor stays low. Rosetta Stone says its techniques are modeled on how native speakers actually learn their own languages, usually while still kids, and I think that's a good description for what the software delivers. You start with words and then move on to phrases, and then with level two you get to conversations. Level three kicks the conversational up a couple of notches. It's a natural progression.

I think there are people who prefer a more standard ""grammar-first"" approach because they've found in the past that this is what works for them. I imagine there are also people who don't like looking at computer screens for lengthy periods. These are valid concerns. There are different pedagogical approaches for a reason -- not everyone learns in the same way. My guess is that Rosetta Stone would serve the majority of people very well, especially students who are comfortable with computer-based learning. Ideally, I think this program will work best for people who are studying a language using many ""inputs"" (text books, audio programs, computer apps, foreign-language media, foreign flicks, native speakers, etc.) All of these things will ultimately reinforce one another. The more immersion, the better.

Overall, I am very pleased with this product. The program's interface is well-designed, I've experienced no bugs or glitches, and I am making progress faster than I thought I would (or at least I think I am). I'd give the app five stars but I cringe just a little bit at the price. I don't think it is overpriced for what you get, mind you, but the cost -- well, it is what it is. There is a demo on the Rosetta Stone Web site that I encourage you to try before buying. It'll give you a good idea how well this program will work for you. If you like the approach, the price for all three levels is well worth it.

Keep in mind that learning any foreign tongue will realistically take a while. Rosetta Stone shortens the learning period a good deal and makes sticking with the program easier, but it's only a foundation. Still, it's a pretty darn good one, and I can see why it's so popular with the international business community.",Popular with the international business community for a reason,1229990400,15,

My main complaint was that the date field would revert to the current date whenever I temporarily left the entry to do something else. Frequently I ended up with several incorrect dates and had to go back and fix them.  Also I should mention that I only use the check registry and no other features.  This annoyance has been mostly corrected. You can go to Find, for example, and then return to the entry and the entered date will still be there.  If you wander too far, the date may revert, but the main problem has been resolved.  So far as I am concerned, this would be the main reason to upgrade from the 2008 version.

I did not find the new features useful.  I cannot make the ""flag"" feature do anything, so I gave up on it.  Now I would like to make OCCASIONAL use of the Tag and Notes features, but to do that, I would have to make them  available.  The problem is that this would add two extra keystrokes when entering a check as the Amount column is at the end.  Quicken claims that you can arrange the register's columns anyway you like, but I found I could not move the Amount column to be next to the Category field so as to avoid the extra keystrokes.  You would think that fields that are not used for every entry would be placed after the Amount field which has to be filled in for every entry.  Of course one could theoretically hide Tag and Notes and call them up only when needed, but surely the information on them ought to be visible all the time so that one does not overlook it. In any event, it is much easier to stick a notation into the Memo field rather than call up two other fields from time to time.

In all fairness, I think the Attachment feature might be useful but I have not yet have had occasion to try it.
In conclusion, if you do not yet have a program for keeping track of your checks or finances, I would strongly recommend Quicken Deluxe 2011.  Over the many years I have used Quicken, it has undoubtedly saved me hundreds of dollars in duplicate contributions or extended subscriptions, and thousands of hours of time.

Course back then you had to use super-8 film cameras and it took a lot of time and effort to get something good. Nowadays, with the software and technology available today - even young children can make some really neat videos and it doesn't have to cost a whole lot of money.

This software is very easy to use, the controls are very simplified and all you need besides the software is a computer and a webcam. I tried two different cameras, one a regular webcam (Logitech C615) and one of the U-create Games and Artimation devices. I had much better results with the HD webcam than I did with the low-resolution camera on the U-Create unit, but the results with the lesser camera really wasn't that bad. What you can do with these is limited to your imagination and what props and material you have on hand.

So, if you have some children who like to be creative and have a computer and a detachable webcam this would be the prefect summer activity (or winter) to keep them busy and maybe teach them something in the process. If you go that route, and want to be a bit educational - search the web for lesson plans and instructions handouts, like I mentioned there are teachers out there using software like this with their students.",Very easy to use.,1396137600,,

The program is also available on-line at hdrsoft dot com, where you can get a free trial before buying.

This program is extremely easy to use, and once you've taken your three shots with auto-exposure bracketing, or more exposures at your choosing, you just click to upload them, and then follow the on screen choices.  A tripod is certainly necessary for good clean HDR images, but this software is so flexible that it will take your hand-held (slightly off) images, and align them, also fixing any ""ghosting"" from moving trees or shaky images. You can also use single images and apply tone-mapping, which also gives dynamic images.  Simple sliders allow you to tweak your images before saving them.

Your first tries will no doubt prove to be eye-openers, but keep in mind that the best images are the ones that are not ""overdone"" and totally fake looking.  Professionals use this program, and given its simplicity and affordability, so can you.

My only complaints are. This switch does not support STP, or spanning tree protocol. They have updated the firmware the pass the traffic to prevent a packet storm.

1. Quick View/Finder Icons -- all my documents, PDFs, pictures and Excel files show up as icon previews in the Finder. When I press the space bar, a large version pops up. Now I no longer have to open an application to read over a file quickly. It's also nice for photos

2. Spotlight -- That's the quick find search box in the upper right corner of the screen. It's WAY, WAY, WAY faster than in the previous OS X and can do complex searches if you like. Plus, now when I type a math problem (for example ""123-25"") in the box, Spotlight shows the result (i.e. ""123-25=98""). If I type in a word I don't know, the definition also appears with the other search results.

3. Preview -- Anyone who's ever opened the regular version of Adobe Acrobat knows how dog slow this application is (plus waiting for the updater takes forever). When I open a PDF in a web browser, I have to wait like 10-20 seconds for Acrobat to load. No more. Preview can open PDFs, and now it has lots of controls that make it useable. I can highlight text, write comments, draw shapes on PDFs without opening Acrobat. Yeah!!!

4. Mail -- This is Apple's email client, and it's finally good enough to replace Microsoft Entourage. It's integrated with iCal and Address Book, so everything is connected while still being easy to use. For example, Mail will find stuff that looks like an invitation to do something and offer to put it in your calendar if you hover over that part of the text. By the way, it's also very FAST, especially when showing fancy html messages.

5. Speed -- Overall, this system is just speedier and eliminates a lot of minor inconveniences. By speedier, I don't mean that you really don't need to wait for things to happen. Photoshop opens a lot faster than before, and Safari is also faster.

I noticed that some people are having problems. Of course, you can never predict other people's problems, but here's two tips that may help some people:

1. After you first upgrade, Spotlight needs to create an index of your computer. This can take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour, but the computer will be slow until it finishes. Don't worry, this only happens once.

2. Make sure you have enough hard drive room on your computer. The operating system takes nearly 9 gigs of space. Keep in mind that you want at least 10 percent of the space free on your hard drive, otherwise it will slow down. Try deleting or backing up unused files (or buy a bigger hard drive).",Best Operating System So Far,1193529600,43,

My first exposure to PowerDirector itself was version 10 and I was pleasantly surprised with the program. Version 11 makes some improvements over version 10. My review will focus mainly on version 11 independently.

Video editing and production software from most vendors works the same as music editing and production software packages. A timeline view allows the user to drag and drop content onto it and there is a plethora of special effects and transitions that can be applied to each element to make transitions easier and smoother. Users comfortable with the likes of Sony Acid or Cakewalk will feel right at home with this method of working.

PowerDirector provides a nice media manager that gives an excellent thumbnail view of all of the available content, and what comes with the package is a very good library of different types of content. The Media Room contains the actual media available immediately (though more can be imported without too much effort). The Effects Room contains a number of motion and blur effects that can be easily applied to visual elements on the timeline. The PiP (Picture in Picture) Room contains several animation elements, mostly drawing effects. The Particle Room contains a couple of motion-type effects that involve multiple embedded objects. The Title Room is for all things text and text effects. The Transition Room contains transition effects that apply to visual elements and made the change between two elements a lot smoother and/or more interesting. The Audio Mixing Room is a simple equalizer and sound balancer for audio elements. The Voice-Over Recording Room allows for direct recording into the production either through a microphone or from the sound card.

PowerDirector provides the ability to capture input from connected devices such as a webcam or a video recorder. The interface to these devices is very straightforward and simple - there's a record button that turns recording on and off, and there is the ability to change the location of captured content and resolution/bitrate settings.

PowerDirector is able to create media in a number of formats, both audio and video. Supported formats include AVI, MPEG-2, AVC, WMV, MPEG-4, MOV, and MKV files. I was unable to find MP3 file output which is a mild disappointment.

My son likes to make stop-motion videos with Legos, and for this task PowerDirector is well-suited. We have been able to import all of his photos at once (usually over 500 individual pictures) put them all on the timeline, change the display duration and create an initial cut at a video in less than 10 minutes. Cyberlink claims to have fast rendering speeds, and PowerDirector 11 seems to live up to those claims in our workings.

The Ultimate version differs from the Ultra (base) version in that it includes additional content packs and filters. These are nice-to-have additions but are certainly not required to be productive.

Comparing versions 10 and 11, while there is a speed difference and there is some minor tweaks in the interface to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing, I am not sure that there's a compelling reason to upgrade to version 11 if you already have version 10. The main considerations are the speed improvements and the content, and the content does not seem to have changed too much so it comes down to speed. If the optimizations that make version 11 faster than version 10 are crucial, then it's worth pondering the upgrade. Try the trial version first before committing to see if this is worthwhile.

I like PowerDirector. It's a powerful and easy-to-use video production application that does a nice job of allowing a user to assemble a video quickly. The interface is mostly intuitive and the inner workings are efficient. This is a good package at a very reasonable asking price.","Solid, Intuitive Video Production Software",1357603200,,
3095,3095,5.0,False,"06 13, 2008",A1T6PXM2M3N84A,B0012KZKZC,,Harold McFarland,"The Corel Suite X4 Installed on my Windows XP Pro system with Service Pack 2 without any problems.  Then I started the program and it loaded... and loaded.... and loaded.  It took several seconds for it to finally come up to a screen where I could do something.  While startup was very slow, I was satisfied with how the program ran from that point forward.  It appears that a lot of stuff has to load to get it started but when it is done it works fine.  The only problem I had with the program was that it hung on two occassions.  Unfortunately, it hung the system so bad that I could not even use control-alt-delete to get access to shut it down.  Nothing responded.  The second time it happened I pulled my USB drive out before powering it down and the system returned control to me!  I don't know the source of the problem but after some testing I could get it to hang consistently when the SanDisk USB drive with U3 was in the computer.  It did not do it with my Toshiba without U3.  So, maybe it is a U3 thing, maybe a SanDISK thing, or maybe the combination.

The first thing to note in the program is the very intuitive user interface.  The more advanced a program is the more cluttered the interface tends to become.  However, this Suite was fairly uncluttered given it's advanced abilities.  This is not to say there is no learning curve because there is one, but it was not as steep as I had expected.

This Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.

With strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.

The other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.

The Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.

In summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.","Great program, versatile, competitively priced",1213315200,2,

Yes, as you can read in other reviews here, this new Mac version can't touch the PC version on a feature-for-feature basis. The PC version is so much more mature, has so many more options and value-added services (not to mention complete payroll management, if you need that), whereas the Mac version is just coming out of the starting gate.

BUT, if you're running a Mac and don't want to bother with a PC, or with running Windows on your Mac just to run QuickBooks, and if you don't need to manage payroll or use some of the other advanced features, then you can feel comfortable with buying QuickBooks as an entry-level solution for a small business.

Let me say up front that I have actually used it.  Also note that I have used quite a few different types previously, my favorite being Adobe Premiere Elements.

This version from Pinnacle is not by any means user friendly.  If you are a novice, you won't find that the process has a ""easily walks me through it"" design to it by any means.  It is, in fact, fairly difficult to do even basic things...like add titles or captions to the timeline.

You will see a tab toward the bottom called ""SmartMovie,"" that does make things a little bit simpler....but even with this option it's still not all that easy to navigate your way through the process.

Two main things about this software that I found fairly annoying:

1) If you want to view the online training videos from Pinnacle, you can only do so if you subscribe to their site for $7 per month....otherwise the video stops about a fourth of the way through and a pop-up pushes you to make this purchase.  Until you do, you're blocked from viewing the videos.

2) It does not burn to Blue-ray discs unless you download a plug-in that will allow this feature, which also costs $7 to download.  Really Pinnacle?  I mean....really?  Even the MyDVD software that comes with it has a burn to Blue-ray option on it, which is greyed out because you have not yet purchased the plug-in.  Horrible business model, IMO.

What I did manage to do was to burn a short 4GB AVCHD movie on a DVD DL disc, and I was able to include a title for it.  Oddly, the transition from one clip to another had special effects built in for switching from one clip to another...swiping from left to right, loading the next clip from the middle out, etc.  At first it was pretty cool to look at, but eventually it got annoying.  I was able to finally figure out from the manual how to go in and take the transitions out of the timeline.  It was strange to me that these special transition effects were set up by default.

When I tried to burn a larger, 10GB movie (as a side note, all of these are HD family vacation footage), of course I couldn't load it on a DVD DL disc due to its size, so I decided to save the file and then I would burn it from my Adobe software. Halfway through to exporting it to the folder, however, the Studio 20 software froze up and stopped exporting....so I had to close it.  BTW, I have a fairly robust PC....Core i7 CPU, 12GB RAM, etc.

Basically, unless you want software to make AVCHD movies less than 8.5GB in total size that will not burn to Blue-ray unless you download a plug-in at an additional cost, I would look elsewhere.  My suggestion is Adobe Premier Elements....that's the one I have had the most success with.

The software includes the AVG Firewall, AVG Identity Protection, AVG Antispam and of course the virus scanner.  AVG now uses a feature called Smart Scanning which scans files while you are using your computer as a low priority process.  In the past, you may remember virus scanning programs would tend to freeze your games while playing.  Now with AVG 2011, this problem has almost disappeared.  In my experience, the software ran just fine on a dual core desktop computer while playing Jewel Quest with a full system scan running in the background.

My Experiences With Virus Activity In AVG
I used AVG Internet Security 2011 on my brother's computer because I know he tends to surf the web much more than I do.  Sure enough, after just a week of use, AVG had generated over a dozen virus alerts on his machine and I was able to clean them all off.  The computer has a Windows Vista 32bit based operating system on a rather slow SATA hard drive but it managed to repair itself after about four reboots.

Recommended Hardware Configuration
Please be aware that running a virus scan on any hard drive will fully utilize its available bandwidth.  As such, this product is best used with computers that have more than one cpu core.  You should also consider running a file defragmentation before installing AVG Internet Security 2011 so that when the scan does take place, it will be able to complete in a timely manner.  I also recommend using at least 2 GB of memory, especially if a virus has been found a purge operation is conducted.

Conclusion
AVG Internet Security 2011 is my personal pick for virus scanning at home and in my day job as a DBA.  No virus software package can fix a computer flooded with viruses already, but AVG can get you close to a solution, quickly.  My brother's PC is an example of what an extreme power user can do to a machine and how AVG can slowly bring you back.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

After awhile, they all became a blur with features being added, and then dropped, without rhyme or reason. Overall, however, there was nothing that really made it a better version of Windows.

Windows 7 shows proof that Microsoft listened to the customers and decided to give them a product that met their needs.  Windows 7 (I'm referencing the Ultimate version, 64 bit) was a very long install (I upgraded from Vista) clocking in at 5 hours. Immediately I felt a pang of disappointment when it did not keep all of my settings (sounds, image size for folders). However, that was not the end of the world and I promptly forgot about it when I realized that Microsoft gave us Windows 7 and they managed to provide me with two necessary elements where I refused to compromise: the program gave me back disk space so I went from a hard drive almost half full to one that now has 65% disk space free.  Not bad at all. Then, I immediately became aware that this is the first version of Windows where speed is of the essence. Whether rebooting, opening programs (which I can now keep on the bar instead of searching the START menu (you can still pin them there so don't worry)), saving files, etc., Windows 7 moves so fast that my three year old HP notebook was rejuvenated.

Windows 7 does have some bells and whistles: SNAP allows me to open two programs (I tried it with WORD and ONE NOTE) and have them side-by-side. It's easy even though you might not use it frequently. You can also add sticky notes and get a sneek-peek of open programs. Nice.

So I obviously recommend getting the newer edition for the same. But I have not tested X5, so here are my comments on X4:

I have always loved WordPerfect, and as expected I love X4. For almost 2 decades now, WordPerfect has earned a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and in my opinion it's much better than Microsoft Word or putting together a quick Word document.

I also strongly recommend Open Office, an open source, completely free office suite. I've used Open Office almost exclusively for the past 5 years, and it's great for ""light"" word processing, and it's spreadsheet is more than adequate. However, if you are a heavy user, need templates like label templates (Open Office is not great at this), or need somewhat sophisticated word processing functions (like image integration), WordPefect is hands-down the best in my opinion.

Additionally, WordPerfect opens any PDF into Word Perfect. It saves in just about any format (including .docx). Others have touted the optical character recognition (OCR) feature, which can convert a scan to text. This in itself is actually not a big deal - almost every scanner has bundled software that can do this. But having it build into the word processor means you can take a JPG image (such as a scanned receipt) & convert it back into text.

If you already have X4, I doubt that I would actually recommend upgrading to X5 - I don't plan on it. But if you're looking for a new word processor, I would suggest checking out X5. As for X4, I give it an easy 5-stars.",Great ... but already outdated. X5 is available for the same price,1306281600,,

Instead I received the Home and Student Edition.  That instead is a bare bones version of Office.

WHAT YOU GET
Word Perfect (works like previous version except perhaps a little faster)
Quattro Pro (works like previous version)
Presentations
Word Perfect Lightning digital notebook

You also get fonts, dictionary, digital photos, templates, graphics, basic graphics editor, batch conversion from Word files, and training videos.

IS IT WORTH IT?
Yes, this program works well for the price, although honestly, if you can afford the upgrade price of the Standard version or others, I would go for that instead.  I really wanted the Ebook Editor, PDF creator, and some of the other cool features of the Standard version which is what I thought I had requested.

The program works well and seems to be a tiny bit faster than the previous X6 version.  I am using this with Windows 7 64-bit.

This is great for general home use and student use who need basics which are a cut above super basic.  It is a solid program so far, and despite my disappointment in the version I received, I still think it is decent for what you get.

I will edit this review as I continue to use the program if there are any other important points that I want to make if I find differences in the program from version X6.  As it stands now from the time I have used it and played with it, it is quite similar to the previous version of this edition of Office, which I did use with very few problems.  I got files to convert pretty easily from Word, and was able to save them in the proper file form as well, that others could read with Word.

I am giving this four stars, because I think that they should have added a simple Ebook editor and PDF capabilities to this edition like they have in the Standard.  Many academic software versions come with the same as professional programs with a few small things left out sometimes just for a more reasonable price.

H.,"You can slap some animation together fairly easily with this software, even if you have absolutely zero talent whatsoever thanks to the clever but EXTREMELY limted ""Character Creation Wizard"", which really isn't much to speak of.  My hopes were WAY too high for that wizard, I was really disappointed when I saw what it does and doesn't do.  You are not ""creating"" any character - you are merely playing with paper dolls by changing multiple attributes of existing generic characters.  The quality is terrible, they all look like drawings made by 6th graders who were trying to draw pictures of the most boring 1990's video game characters imaginable (really crude versions of ""Mario"" and ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" kind of stuff).  However, if you need to hit the ground running and have no talent whatsoever, then this will definitely get you moving in a hurry.

However, if you do have artistic talent, this software will have you animating your drawings faster than anything else.  The real jewel of this software is the lightning-quick bone rigging and also the physics engine that adds some realism to your work without having to agonize over many of the hassles of getting objects to move properly based on weight, gravity, etc.

Your artistic talent can be animated QUICKLY with this software, provided you are willing to accept some quality limitations as the trade-off.  Though the bone rigging is much easier in this software than Toon Boom, and it does provide smoother and more complete joints, the drawing tools, importing and vectorizing tools and options at your disposal are limited and often frustrating.  Special Effects?  Practically none, probably the biggest reason Anime Pro users drool over Toon Boom.

However, I will highly recommend this product for the absolute beginner in character animation or those who have artistic talent and need to get animating very quickly.  You'll me animating fairly quickly with very little instruction if you have talent or not.  It's great kiddieware, because kids think they have all the time int he world to explore anything and everything.  If you're an adult, however, know that animation is hard, long, and tedious work.  This software will do VERY little of the work for you (welcome to animation), but it will simplify the work you have to do probably more than any other product out there while you learn the ropes.

And for those that think Toon Boom is frame-by-frame animation only, no, it's not - it can tween just as good as any other product.  But you CAN do frame-by-frame if you want, and it does it (everything really) better than any other product.

Anime Studio is what you cut your teeth on, it's nothing more than general hobbyware.  Toon Boom is what you move to if you truly decide to get serious, and is exactly what I did.  My kid sare having a blast with Anime Studio Pro 8.

I've been using Quicken ever since it came out, and Managing Your Money before that, and MS Money for a couple of years. I was satisfied with the 2008 version. There are some improvements in the latest version, most notably the faster updating and the ability for the update to bypass the frequent requests by some banks for answers to security questions. Additionally, I noticed a correction to estimated taxes. The Tax Schedule used to include the January 15th payment in the wrong year, but now you can identify the tax year involved and the report will be correct.

There are two complaints I have and that is the Tax Planner still will not allow you to choose the next year. It is locked on 2011. The other is the tax schedule lists interest by banks, but does not subtotal each bank. Your tax return requires interest be reported by each bank. If I discover anything more I will update this review.

Update:

I moved this review from the guide book to the product itself.

One change I do not like is the way the ""overview"" presents itself now.  Previously, the individual account holdings were shown and no other stock would appear, but now the complete list of stocks you have in your portfolio list shows and you must scroll through it to find the stocks that are currently in the particular account.  I have a long list of stocks, perhaps a hundred that I have bought and sold over the years.  Most are inactive, but they show anyway.  What a mess this is.  I liked the 2008 version of the ""overview"" far better.

I noticed a small problem.  When you reconcile an account you have the option to use a statement or the online balance.  Once you have chosen ""statement"" it seems to always return to statement even if you have subsequently elected to use the online balance method.  I have tested this many times by unchecking the statement choice and even going as far as removing the statement balance, then selecting the online balance method.  The very next time you reconcile it will choose ""statement"" for you.  It is an annoying inconvenience.

One other minor issue is the sound effects.  When you first open Quicken there is a very loud gong noise that will make you wish you had left the sound system off.  The remaining sound is like an old manual cash register ringing up a sale and is tolerable.  Due to the startling nature of the opening ""gong"" I went into preferences and turned the sound off.  My overall assessment is that this product is worth the price even at retail, but you can get a very good deal if you search for it.  I pretty much use Amazon because the prices are really good and you can trust them.  No, I don't work for them or own stock, but I wish I bought a boatload when it was at 32 cents a share!

Let me describe one huge advantage of getting frequent or daily updates.  You can check your credit cards for errors well ahead of the arrival of the statement.  If your card has been stolen you can track its use.  You can inform your issuer in detail about what is yours and what is not, and you can contact the stores where the illegal purchases have been made.  In other words you can stay on top of your credit card activity.  I have used Quicken this way for years and have discovered duplicate charges, and erroneous charges by businesses within hours of the charge being made.

Update:
Do not import data from Quicken into tax software without realizing that there will be errors.  When interest for December is credited it normally gets posted in January therefore when you create a tax schedule it will include the previous year's December and not include the current December.  So, when you make the tax schedule you must do a custom search avoiding interest posted in the wrong year and capturing data for the current tax year posted in the following year.

Since I knew that the all-access portion worked on iPads, I figured that reinforced my hunch.  And yes, it does work with Mac and iPad, as well as Windows 8.1 machines.  (I have not tried it with Windows 10.)

To start learning Spanish, all you need to do is pop in the software DVD and install it on your computer.  If you do not have a DVD drive or if you are installing on a tablet, you need to visit the website to enter your email address and product key to begin the download.  The box also contains an interactive DVD and an MP3 audio CD.  I like that I can copy the audio to iTunes, although it's a little weird how it adds files to my Mac desktop in order to accomplish this.  It sounds like an extended game of Pong.

The software itself is pretty good, although your success will depend in part on how well you tend to grasp foreign languages.  All the PR around Instant Immersion language courses compares them to Rosetta Stone.  I can't make the comparison myself, having never tried Rosetta Stone, but I do know that this is a relatively easy method of teaching yourself Spanish, as long as you take advantage of all the tools.  I find that the trio of reading, speaking, and listening to the same words and phrases helps me learn faster.  I've tried other language courses that leave out one or the other, and that's much more difficult.  The pocket phrase guide, while extremely portable, is difficult to see with older eyes, and it's not necessarily easy to find what I want, even though the words/phrases are grouped by subject, such as days of the week or transportation.  Still, it's better than no guide at all.

This software teaches Latin American Spanish, which is great for most Americans but not so great if you plan to go to Spain.  I cannot find a way to change to European Spanish, so I assume that option is not available.  The iPad Talk Now app mirrors the computer version, which makes it easy to train yourself on one, then switch off to the other.  The Oscar Lake game will appeal to a wide range of ages.

I've used an older Instant Immersion program for Italian, and I find this newer version of the software to be less clunky and visually more friendly, something that's important if children will be using it.  This program is best for learning a smattering of Spanish, not for an in-depth learning program that covers the finer points of grammar and word nuances.  If your aim is to be able to converse a little or understand important written words, this is a great program.

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This ""smart-switch"" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.

Design:
One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.

The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.

The 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.

The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.

The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no ""power brick"" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.

The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.

Configuration:
I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.

' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.
' Change the password - The default password is ""password"", so change it to something better!

The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.

The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:
' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)
' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)
' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).
' Port by port Rate limiting
' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a ""disable"" setting to turn a port off if desired)
' Port by port Broadcast Filtering
' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)
' Multicast control via IGMP snooping
' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)

Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.

Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.

Green Power Use:
The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or ""dumb"" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.

Support:
I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.

Conclusions:
The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.

The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many ""dumb"" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.

I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.

I'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.

Word is effectively the standard format for documents in the American business world, and most of my employers use Exchange as their email server. Therefore, what I most want from my office suite is something that 1. works well reading and writing Word documents and 2. provides a way to connect to my employer's Exchange server and properly handle its calendars, meeting requests, etc.

Office 2008 for Mac just does that! I pulled up and edited my old PC Office-created Word resume with no problem, and haven't experienced major issues reading any other Word document yet. The Exchange capabilities of Entourage work like a charm, let you accept and send meeting requests and generally enable you do all of the things you're used to doing with Outlook, but can't currently do with Mac Mail. The simple Excel spreadsheets I used for timesheets pulled up in Mac Excel without a hitch and Messenger and Powerpoint are nice-to-haves.

For better or worse (I say better), the interface for Office 2008 for Mac isn't the ribbon interface you may be used to with Office 2007 for PC, but after getting used to the Mac's Office interface, I actually found it easier to use!

I miss having applications like OneNote (though Word has a similar ""Notebook"" mode), InfoPath and Visio, the forthcoming version of Mac Mail diminishes Entourage's value by providing Exchange support and power-users of Office may miss features like the ability to hack together VBA macros (the Mac Workflows are a bit more limited), but for most business users, Office 2008 for Mac will suit their needs perfectly and provide the necessary hook into the Microsoft Office suite that currently dominates the business landscape.

Overall, I'd recommend the package and think it's an essential purchase for most business users especially since SP2 added Live Workspace and SharePoint integration. However, with Mac Mail gaining Exchange support and because there are several programs for PC Office that don't come with Office 2008 for Mac, the Mac suite loses a star in my eyes.",Great at General Productivity and Exchange Email.

""Ziping"" programs that are out there. I can't recall what version of WinZip I have used most frequently but after using v. 17 I'm very pleased with the changes made to the software and it remains very easy to use and full of new and excellent features.

First things first though:

Setup:
Setting up the software on my Windows 7 machine was very easy. To save anyone a hassle, there is a printed serial number in your DVD case, mine was under the installation instructions on the inside-front of the case. You'll need the number for registration. After installing the application you'll go through the process of registering the software which does ask for a number of personal details such as address, name, etc. but only really requires your serial number and email address. Your email is used to send you a copy of the license or registration code. All in all setup was not bad at all.

--------------------

Use:
The interface of WinZip has changed a lot in the intervening years. The basic layout, however, is easy to navigate and understand even for a novice. The toolbar is laid out in a familiar tabbed form. Each tab containing additional tools and access to settings. My favorite new features are the inclusion of access to cloud storage service such as Google Drive, Dropbox and SkyDrive. I used WinZip 17 for example to compress a 15-minute video I made for my home owners insurance policy and uploaded it to my Google Drive storage all within the WinZip application! You'll of course need to have an account with one (or more) of the cloud storage services and authenticate first.

There are some advanced features here such as building self-extracting '.exe' files, adding document watermarks, encryption. I did not use these features so will refrain from further comment other than to say that they're present for those interested in such.

--------------------

What I like about this software:
(+) Tried and true ""zipping"" utility that does a good job
(+) Version 17 doesn't try to reinvent the wheel just polish what's there and add important and relevant new features
(+) Adding watermarks or converting documents to PDF is very, very easy
(+) Wondering just how much space you're actually saving by Zipping that file?... now each job features a memory report on how much memory is saved!

--------------------

What I don't like about this software:
(-) Some of the features require upgrading to the ""Pro"" version or require additional monthly fees - such as the FTP feature

We see the most significant update since years with X7 and many more useful add-ons.  Here's what's new for Ultimate X7.  *** At the end of the review I'll compare X7 Ultimate to X7 Pro ***

UPDATE #1 - 64-Bit processing. This is huge!  All previous versions were 32-bit, meaning that the new 64-bit X7 can process videos at twice the power.  To get a grasp on this concept, think of your computer processor as being a tube that can either be 32 or 64 inches wide. When you have the smaller 32 inch size, less information can flow through and the tube is more likely to  full and ""bottleneck"". Bottlenecks are when the maximum information is flowing through the tube.  This causes other processing to slow down and your system to load slower because each process has to wait for the others to finish before it can begin. If you 64 inch wide tubes, then there is 2x as much room for information to pass through before the computer bottlenecks and slows down.

Some people online ran some speed tests and they found that the new VideoStudio X7 beats last year's VideoStudio X6 by rendering up to 68 percent faster for HD multitrack projects with hardware acceleration, up to 153 percent for 4K projects, and up to 854 percent with smart rendering (processing only the changed regions of the video.  This is nearly twice to more than twice as fast as last year for standard rendering and nearly 9 times as fast for smart rendering (less processing done on each video when rendering, more carryover from original video clip).  These are amazing gains!

Since Windows 7, most computers are running 64-bit Windows.  Now Corel is running at 64-bit as well.  This is the greatest improvement - beyond all the add-ons and plug-ins.  This is a true core software update.  This is alone is enough to want any user of Corel VIdeoStudio (any version) to upgrade to X7. Thanks Corel!

UPDATE #2 New HD add-ons and effects.  Since the software is now 64-bit, Corel has given us higher resolution (1920 x 1080) HD templates, backgrounds, and color patterns.

UPDATE #3 - FastFlick.  This feature is aimed at the beginner video user or people wanting to spend less time making videos.  FastFlick is a one-click processing feature that adds may effects, themes, transitions, etc onto a single video, series of video clips or series of photos...immediately processing it and rendering it as a brand new stylized video.  Basically, select your own videos or photos, then select the FastFlick theme you want, click start and come back to a completed final video that is ready to upload and watch.

UPDATE #4 - Cleaner Layout.  This is a minor change, but still important enough to list.  They cleaned up the layout / video editing screen to give us more space, less clutter.  The look is not closer to Corel Paintshop, making it easier for a person to use both softwares.

UPDATE #5 -  Discovery Center Video Tutorials.  This feature I really like. There are so many features to VideoStudio X7 that discovering them all on your own is very unlikely.  The video tutorials in the Discovery Center (access by a little blue button at the top right toolbar) guide a person through many of the great features and quickly teach anyone how to use the software.  I personally love video tutorials over written tutorials (which Corel also includes as PDFs, accessible through the main menu as well).  Watching the process is better than reading about it.

So here you have it - the top 5 new updates for Corel VideoStudio X7!

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ULTIMATE X7 and PRO X7 VERSIONS

VideoStudio Pro X7 vs. VideoStudio Ultimate X7

These two versions are basically the same except that Ultimate X7 gives you 7 special effects apps that are not in the Pro version.  All of these are very high quality, helping you to create more professional looking videos.  Other than that, the software is identical..

1) NewBlue FX ColorFast - Color correction tools to improve the look of the video (either more realistic color corrections or more abstract - you control it).

2) NewBlue FX Motion Effects - Over 100 preset motion effects to create some very creative looks.

3) Boris Graffiti 6 - A large collection of titles and graphics.

4) proDAD Mercalli SE - Video stabilization plus advanced features that create the shaky camera effects that are very popular in today's videos.

5) proDAD VitaScene LE - Even more transitions, filters and film-style effects.

6) proDAD Handscript Animation - Handwriting effects that animate as the video plays - such as signing a signature.  Great for titles.

7) proDAD RotoPen - Rotoscope style animated effects for maps, graphics and photos. Rotoscope is where the video turns into a sketchpad or animated cartoon look.

So this is a lot of great features to get for only $20. Get Ultimate.

MY PERSONAL OPINION

The long story short.  3 years ago (with Corel VideoStudio X5) I switched over from using Adobe Premiere Elements and I haven't looked back.  I use the Corel VideoStudio software about once every week or two for 3-4 hours, plus periods of daily use when I have larger projects.  I like to get the newest version each year because Corel is always adding more plug-ins, effects, filters, etc.  The bottom line is Corel VideoStudio is the best bang for your buck and a flawless performer.  I feel it blows away Adobe Premiere Elements and the other $100-ish video software.",#1 reason to upgrade to X7 is the 64-bit processing -- 2x to 9x faster than X6!!!!,1400112000,15,

That being said, from the perspective of a layperson, this version of Trend Micro's security software appears to be doing a sufficient job protecting me and my computer from our respective selves. The first point to mention is that setup is extremely user friendly, even with regard to some of the specific software settings. At this point I have probably meddled with the configurations as much as I ever will, as I have only utilized this product on my home PC. Nonetheless, I have taken further steps customizing my security settings than I have ever done previously simply because of this software's ease of use and thorough, yet simple, explanation of available functions. One such customization option that I have now utilized for the first time on any security software is the parental control/web browser settings. The ability to restrict specific categories of information, images, and data, as well as descriptions of each category, allows one to feel confident in what they are blocking and what they are allowing on a user specific basis.

Beyond the actual customizable functions, almost everyone probably has the same question: will this security software slow everything on my computer to a screeching halt? After a little use, it seems that this particular software has not had the same ridiculous stopping power of other security platforms that I have utilized in the past. That is, as of this moment, I am pleased with my ability to utilize this software as the issuing company recommends while continuing the use of any other applications simultaneously. All in all, I am not disappointed and, perhaps, pleased (if such a thing is possible when dealing with PC/Internet security software).",The Real Deal,1226361600,,

I just installed both on my Dell laptops (Lat 6530 and 6510) which I just bought in January.  In PC World, they maintain you can also install those same MS versions in Win8, but I'm so antagonistic to Win8 I've not installed it, yet.  Original review follows below.

==================

Imagine, if you will, the annual How-to-Alienate-the-Customer Meeting in Redmond, Washington, aka 'upgrade' plan, for MS software.

Ms. Snippy (proudly):  Well, we've redesigned the interface yet again, just like aisles in grocery stores, so the customer will be confused, feel stupid; so will subscribe to our paid help.  Yet we added a cute dog to slow the search process, make it harder to search than prior;  we also reduced the number and types of files search can read, and made the Indexing Service more annoying.  We also forced the interface colors to glare blue and glare white, to increase eyestrain. Thus we can truly call this product 'new'.

Mr. Fleece-the-Customer Project Manager (smiling):  Wonderful, Snippy! But is that all?  Those changes won't confuse the customer long enough;  soon they will stop subscribing to our ignorant help hot lines.

Ms. Snippy (bubbling over): Oh, we've done much more.  Starting with, reducing backwards-compatibility with our own earlier software, and popular programs like Lotus 1-2-3 and Adobe Acrobat; so now it will cost those companies more, to sync with our 'new' software.  And less of their own products, will be read by OUR software, just the same!

Mr. Fleece (eyes wide):  aha, so we can blame them for lack of compatibility, and make more money thereby.  Well done, Snippy!

Ms. Snippy (ecstatic):  Well, here's the best part: we create NEW JOBS!  For now ALL the older material must be retyped or reformatted within our own products, thousands of hours of NEW WORK spent on old material which used to be converted in an instant!  That extra work, is good for America!

Mr. Fleece (with the Arm-and-Hammer look):  yes, teaches the customer a lesson that he shouldn't go anywhere but to us!  for all his software needs.

Ms. Nudger (sheepishly):  Um, excuse me.  We've also made our own earlier products incompatible with the 'new' version.  So how do we blame the other software companies, when in fact we also are incompatible with our own products?

Mr. Fleece:  Can't you recognize 'progress'?  It's the policy here to force people to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, never ending, never matching, never fitting the past -- just like DETROIT proudly does with American cars!  You're UNAMERICAN, Nudger; and you're FIRED!

===========

The above fictional conversation is not wholly fictional.  Eleven years ago, my one and only pay-for-help hour spent with a Microsoft employee basically resulted in him admitting Fleece's last lines.  In the name of progress.  I kid you not.  The rest of the fictional conversation is easily deduced by the actual history of MS products.  So too, here with Word 2003, when the elimination of backwards-compatibility, really begins.  Later versions of Office are even worse.  I've tried and rejected them.  But after reading reviews of how Word 2003 allegedly fixed the bugs with respect to right-to-left text (i.e., Hebrew), I wanted to try this.  Yeah, what a mistake!  Two copies I bought, both of them nearly useless!

Why?  Um, if you can't even retrieve your own previous files in the 'upgrade' version, then why upgrade?  Hmmmm?

For every 'upgrade' of Office becomes more and more dysfunctional.  I bought Word 2003 due to the many bugs in Word 2000-2002, but guess what?  Word 2003 TOOK AWAY what was good in those older programs, and substituted even more bugs and dysfunctionality.  That 'progress' continues from Word 2003, onward.  OFFICE and hence Word 2010 is so incompatible, after downloading the trial version in only two hours I was so frustrated, I uninstalled it. With difficulty.

Here's the scam: the 'upgrades' are like the opening dialogue, above.  The 'upgrades' complicate procedures which were simple in earlier versions, especially in Word and Excel, prior to version 2003.  For example, you used to just click on Help, and you actually got a chm file OF Help.  Not now.  Now, the DEFAULT in Word takes you ONLINE.  Takes two hours to figure out how to change that default, so you can get the old help file you're used to.  So too, the ? in a dialogue box USED to function simply: you clicked on the ?, then moved your mouse to the section on the dialogue box you wanted to understand, and got a semi-coherent explanation of that section's function.  Not now.  Now, another dialogue box opens with a lot more text, and you must SCROLL SCROLL SCROLL to find the item you could have gotten in 2 seconds, under the old method.  With no more coherence, of course.  Often, even less.  Help like this:  if the dialogue box says 'make operation operational', of course you have no idea what 'operation' is in view.  So in the old days, you clicked on ? and you got a tool tip which said, 'this function makes the operation, operational'.  That of course elucidated nothing, but at least it was fast.  Now, in Word 2003, you get the same message, but it took you three or four minutes to even FIND the same line of text as in the dialogue box, within the new and de-proved help file.  That is, after you spent two hours figuring out how to turn off the default ONLINE help which of course never helped you, either.

It's not by accident that most law firms still offer backwards-compatible documents for Word97-2003.  They have to.  Legal and accounting stuff has to be kept for YEARS.  Notice the range of the offering.  2003 and prior.  Word 2003, however, is far less desirable than prior versions: its clipboard is worse, its buttons are harder to customize and actually they removed some useful button customizations like Reveal Formatting;  the PERMISSION annoyance (covered below) means you might have to go through all your old documents and establish permissions, even on your own computer (problem on XP Pro, not Home).  And frankly, I don't see any functions which are improved, versus Word 2002.  Only new annoyances.

The usual company retort to complaints like mine, is to deem the customer ignorant of computers, puh!  Balderdash.  I've been working with computers since Trash-80.  I still have my old 286's, and they still work.  Admirably.  So it's not like I'm a computer neophyte, and my business depends on word processing and spreadsheets.  To date, nothing beats Multimate II (a DOS product) for merges, and DOS (not Windows) Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x, for calculations.  All Excel has to offer, is formatting the final product.

To wit:  oh, now in Excel 2003, you can't retrieve Lotus 1-2-3 wk1 files, but get a 'restricted policy' notice.  By the way, this very 'policy' is itself buggy.  If I use XP Home, I don't get the problem.  It only occurs with XP Pro.  See?  MS products don't work with each other.  That lone $90 hour I spent paying for MS help years ago, resulted in this gem of explanation:  each programmer only gets certain subroutines to write.  The programmers are isolated, and don't get to see how the product fits together.  So OF COURSE there will be bugs.  Design requires a wholistic approach, which at MS, is anathema.  Okay, then: their products will waste billions of dollars in customer time trying to work around the bugs.  Not to mention, eventually MS will tank due to such a stupid policy.  But I digress...

Back to the problem: you can't open your own files when you are the administrator?  And you're not told how to get permission?  Oh, wait: you can ONLY get permission if you use Microsoft's ONLINE PASSPORT SERVICE?  Access to your own computer not online, depends on you establishing credentials online? Oh but yes!  You download a silly 'rights management' program which you can't even install, unless you subscribe to NET passport ONLINE, which means to access your own files on your own computer to use them in Office, you have to BE online, establish your credentials, and only THEN can you open your own documents on your own computer.  What drunk thought of that?  And of course, if MS voluntarily ends the PASSPORT program, then you can't even do that convoluted and needless procedure to open your own documents on your own computer offline.

So MS won't even allow you the administrator to control your own computer, with Word 2003. So here's the scam workaround: you have to settle for XP Home, or contact them in Redmond; of course you wait for an hour on the phone, then for $90 per hour they will be happy to spend four more hours 'helping' you to solve THEIR OWN TYRANNICAL BUG.  Of course, the 'help' person at MS knows absolutely nothing about the software, so first you go through irrelevant questions like do you have a virus, in order to eat up time and cost you more money.

Forget the other junk in the Suite.  It works not at all.  The Outlook 2003 was so badly designed I just flat removed it.

Excel is totally retarded, for audit-trail accounting.  Everything about its structure is buggy and arcane.  I spent FOUR HOURS today, just trying to figure out why it wouldn't recognize a labelled number, as a LABEL.  Previous version of Excel had the opposite bug: if you typed in a number, it automatically treated it as a label, unless you put an equals or plus or minus sign in front of the number.  Sheesh.  But at least Excel 2002 and prior, would recognize the label marker and treat what followed AS a label.  (This matters: say you're doing billing like I was, and you wanted to LABEL a billing amount, to keep it out of your totals;  in Excel 2002 and prior, you can do that easily.  But NOT, in Excel 2003, and no FUNCTION formula will let you do it.  More could be said, but then I'll have apoplexy.)

By contrast, old DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x -- which IBM owns now, and won't sell -- along with its add-in (nee: Funk Software) 'Worksheet Utilities' is totally superior, especially for actuarial and other number-intensive, date-intensive, audit-trail-intensive calculations.  Runs in a DOS window in XP, and I'm told by my computer guys that I can get a DOS window in Win7, so might upgrade to Win7.  Whew.  Calculation in our modern computers is instantaneous.  DOS rocks.  So too, that version of Lotus.  Later versions don't work well with dates.  Forget the later Quattro Pro, too.

Excel's only good for formatting the final reports, and even then inanely won't let you store print STYLES without extreme effort: you do it by setting up your windows, print area, then name the whole thing as a CUSTOM VIEW.  Forget macros.

I could spend hours ranting about the flaws in Word or Office Professional, vintage 2010 backwards.  Word is totally incapable of a decent merge, for example.  The trouble you have to go to in order to make merging work in Word, means that unless you've got thousands of records, you might as well do it by hand.  And with thousands of records, count on half of them coming out wrong unless yhou spend thousands of hours designing a very precise database which is thirty times harder to manage, versus the old DOS days.  Unbelievable.  No wonder prices rise so much.  We're all spending downtime trying to get basic word processing functions, to work!

So too, forget Front Page;  it's easier to write your own html code in Word.  Business Contact Manager?  You're better off with pencil and paper!  Access?  Someone on crack designed it. The Photo thingy isn't all that bad, but its bugs abound.  Outlook 2003 is the worst.  They removed all the flexibility of earlier Outlook versions, and of course made the interface completely frustrating, to boot.  Outlook has always been way overcomplicated, but if you have a lot of stuff to juggle and you use it daily (which you must, or you'll forget how) -- it can be helpful.  Simpler is old Sidekick in DOS.  Sigh, you can't store it in the UMB, in Windows.  But it works just fine on an old 486...

So instead of reading only my ranting -- Google on a MS program name, add the word 'sucks' -- you'll find even whole discussion forums devoted to that second word.  Usually such vulgar language is inapt.  But not here.  Every swear word ever invented, belongs to Office products and to MS software in general.  It's deliberately unintuitive, confusing, buggy and mediocre, so you have to subscribe to paid help.  That's the only explanation which makes sense of the data. Same can be said for Adobe, Roxio, Symantec and Corel products.  So MS isn't the only scammer in town.

Go back to DOS software:  its products work well on these faster machines.

Microsoft always forces purchasing latest products for end of support period. However, how many injury occured? The answer is [zero]. You can confirm it with retrieving the information in the Internet. Informational underdogs are being deceived by the sales promotion. Even if you suffered from a victim, the amount of damage is much less than [the cost of the installation for the useless software].

1) Installation took over an hour.  It's 4 disks, 4 programs, and 4 long winded serial numbers to enter correctly.  It's a pain.
2) Once installed, this still does not act like a ""suite"".  There are 4 different programs you have to find and learn to use. You can't quickly and easily move between the programs.  Another pain.
3) It's pretty limited.  I'm more familiar with Google's Picassa for manipulating photos, the one thing I do a lot of, as I use photos in blogs and websites.  I find myself still resorting to the free software to accomplish the basics because this software is such a pain to figure out how to use.  I just want to crop, sometimes increase shadows, add a watermark, and reduce the resolution to post them on the net.  That isn't a quick few clicks with this software, and I never have figured out how to add a watermark.
4) My partner has voiced complaints that it has duplicated photos and done some other weird stuff to the computer its installed on, resulting in excessive number of duplicate files.  It automatically wants to snatch up any images, and creates additional work in terms of just getting the job done.

The plus side?  It's kind of fun to play with.  I may create some digital scrapbooks for my granddaughter.  The ""paint"" portion is real limited, and the results are usually far from wonderful, so it's just a 'toy'.  It's almost like a sampler of digital imaging software in a simplistic form.  At least I could figure out some stuff on my own, whereas with the programs pros prefer, I was incapable of doing much of anything.

Who would like this software?  Someone who likes playing with their photos and doing digital scrapbooking or creating material for a traditional scrapbook.  Teens and young moms will probably find it more to their tastes.  For us ""grandma geek"" sorts, it's a bit too complicated for quick & easy use, and too simplistic to devote a lot of time learning to use it.  I'd rate it as ""okay"" but nothing too exciting.  It can do more than Picassa, for example, which is nice, but for the simple tasks of just managing photos and posting them to the internet, it's a bit too bloated.

I invest at Betterment. COM, where I made two sales and once changed my stock/bond percentages. To me that was 3 transactions, but to H&R Block and the IRS it's at least sixty, maybe a hundred. The program downloads that information from Betterment -- no problem! But then it FORCES me to ""confirm"" every one of them individually. That means clicking ""edit"" next to each one that has an exclamation point (all of them -- several hundred entries) and clicking ""Next"" anywhere from two to five times, depending.

There's no effin' way I can actually CONFIRM all those details -- I have to trust Betterment. But H&R Block does not, so it will take an hour or two to do what's supposed to be ""automatic"". All of this for a total of $97 in capital gains and $5 in disallowed short sales.

In the 2013 product, after ""confirming"" each transaction, H&R Block brought me back to the top of the list, where I had to scroll down, down, down, down, down (yawn), down, down, down to find a transaction not yet ""confirmed"". This made an annoying situation even worse.

In the 2014 product, another user found that he could essentially ignore all those ! marks and he was able to e-file without ""confirming"" those transactions. I have not filed as yet, but I have successfully passed the ""error checking"" phase.

First, because it is designed to take advantage of more computing power if your computer has it available. My computer does in fact have quite a bit of muscle, and I did find this version of this software to be faster. It's certainly not ""WOW"" faster, but quite noticeably faster. However, if your computer is lacking in the power department, you likely won't notice much of a difference in rendering speeds, so do take that into account.

The second reason I got this new version is because it allows me to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future.

Now, while this new version has an array of great new features, the third reason I got PowerDirector 12 Ultimate is for its new MultiCam Designer feature. This great new feature allows you to quickly and easily put together a video using up to four different camera angles/sources. I've already utilized this new feature a couple of times and it's terrific. Awesome new feature. This new feature alone makes upgrading to this new version worth the cost.

Lastly, while all these new improvements are great, what makes this new ""Ultimate"" version a winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. PowerDirector 12 Ultimate is a fantastic set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. It currently has the most bang for your video editing buck.

I went to Best Buy to get a new computer. I stood there and tried out Windows 8 on different computers. I am a semi expert on Windows - I've owned a 95, 98, XP, Vista, and Windows 7. I have 7 computers in my household of 5 people, and I am a big fan of Windows and have studied up each one as it came out to know almost everything about it. I feel that Windows has greatly enriched and empowered my life the last fifteen years.

But I had a heck of a time with Windows 8. The store employee had to show me how to get started like I'm someone clueless about Windows. I greatly disliked the big squares on the screen. They are ugly, take up too much space, and has no reason to be there. A small file icon is all that's necessary. One of the computers were on with the wrong aspect ratio and I tried to fix it but couldn't find display settings even when I found the settings. Couldn't find the control panel. Couldn't do nothing. Windows Vista took a bit to get used to too, but at least it was beautiful with its brand new Aero effect. Windows 8 is just plumb ugly with nothing but big squares. I don't want a big sign of ebay on my screen, but even if I did, I don't need it that big.

Finally, I got so annoyed that I did not get a new computer but instead, went home and ordered online a desktop that has Windows 7.

My prediction: Microsoft has maxed out on Windows with Windows 7. They will never produce any better Windows than 7.

Note to self: Be satisfied with Windows 7 and never expect anything more from Microsoft.

I will post this comment on Amazon now and add to it 5 or 10 years later. If my prediction proves to be wrong (which would be great for everyone) I will admit that I am wrong in the above prediction. If I turn out to be right, I will gloat.

(10/22/2013)

I wrote the above a year ago. A couple of months ago, I bought a new laptop directly from Dell. They still give the option of Windows 7 or Windows 8, and I chose 7 because my laptop does not have a touch screen.  Just so you know,even now, you can still buy a brand new Windows 7 computer if you want to. My new computer's aero effect looks so good, sometimes I just sit and admire it!

Funny story: A friend of mine recently went to Turkey and told me it was paradise on earth. He has a Windows 8 computer. I ask him to email me some pictures of the paradise, but he says he can't because he still hasn't figured out how to use Windows 8! I laughed when I heard him say that.

Another funny story: my son was telling his school friend on the phone how to do something simple on the computer. I heard him yell, ""Just go to the Start button and choose control panel!"" Then he yelled, ""Why can't you find the Start button, it's right there on every computer!"" So I had to interrupt to say that if his buddy has Windows 8 there is no Start button. My son's jaw dropped, then he screamed, and in the end, his friend still couldn't do the simple thing. It made me laugh, though.

One last thing: I just want to clarify this: I don't mind learning a totally different kind of Windows if it's better. I love computers and I love what's new and better, even if it has a steeper learning curve. But I don't like ugly.

I had resorted to using Microsoft OneNote (which I still use for other purposes) for sketches.

Sketch Book Pro offers the simplicity of doodle/sketching with some of the finer features of a mature drawing application such as pressure sensitive support and controls,support for gestures, flexible placement of pallets, etc.

In addition to these benefits it is a very reasonable price compared to other products. I do not use the painting features, but the pencil, marker, and other features are perfect for sketching and initial concept work.

I refused to put a Windows OS on my new Mac - that would open the machine up to Windows virus attacks and other problems.

I tried ""Crossover"" which allowed me to use a Quicken for Windows program but did not require a Window OS.  That was ok but it was slow, a bit buggy, and there was no interface with ICal (so no easy alerts).

Then I found IBank!!

Not only did IBank work beautifully with my Leopard and Snow Leopard OS but it put dates and reminders into ICal with no problem.  I was very happy that it looked like a true Mac program instead of a Windows program.

I highly recommend IBank!  You can use the full program for 30 days before you buy it OR you can buy it and return it for 100% money back if you do not find it to be what you need.

Amazon offers a $20 credit for people who switch to IBank from Quicken -- making the program cost $39.95 instead of $59.95!  What is not to like about that?

I have used IBank's customer service  two different times and found them to be knowledgeable, efficient, and very helpful.  They answered both questions in my first contact.

Quicken is coming out with a Mac Financial software in February- finally.  It appears to be sort of a Quicken for Mac 2010.  I will not buy it or try it!!

Why?

I resent Intuit's attitude that Mac owners don't deserve an up-to-date program for 3 years.  I don't want to support that kind of treatment to a long-time customer.  Also Intuit's new program seems to be a limited version of their Quicken for Windows programs.  I strongly suggest you check out Inuit's Q & A about the February 2010 Mac program at quicken.com.  I doubt you will want a ""fluff"" but little ""meat"" Quicken on your Mac.

IBank has had 2 updates (free to version 3 owners) within my 8 months of owning the program.  Each update came with a new complete program download and all information from my previous IBank version was transferred with no problems.

The IBank program does not allow ""direct bill pay"" like the old Quicken I was accustomed to.  However -- many banks no longer allow that service any longer either.  Both of my checking account banks (Citizens and TD Bank) do not allow direct bill pay through third party financial software any longer so I did not really suffer a loss by switching to IBank.  That may be a ""security"" protection improvement?

IBank imports Quicken data from Windows and Mac with no problems.  Set up is easy for connecting and using most bank web sites.

I used Turbo Tax for Mac (both platforms are on most versions of TTax and TaxCut CDs) last year.  I do not import information from Quicken or IBank into TTax - oI do import the personal information from previous TurboTax for Windows programs.  I cannot say anything about importing data from IBank.

I think IBank does have a lot to offer and unless you have a business or are very wealthy -- IBank should do the job for you WITH all the dependable and helpful MAC features (and connections to ICal) that you expect from your Mac.

There are some very low ratings of IBank listed in these reviews!  I do not understand why.

I know that I have not had any of the problems addressed in the poor reviews.

If you have an Intel Mac or MacBook -- I do not think there will be a problem that IBank's free customer service could not fix.  However, if there is no ""fix"" for a problem you may experience with IBank -- you lose nothing!  Just take advantage of IBank's free trial money back guarantee!!

I do not have any connection with Intuit or IBank.  I spent my time writing this review because I truly think IBank is a GREAT alternative to Quicken for any new Mac owner!!!",IBank is solid and helpful.,1262563200,55,

For most users who don't want to work with advanced features or settings beyond the recommended settings, Trend Micro Titanium has been slightly simplified over the previous Internet Security version from past years. It's fast in scanning, it doesn't slow down my computer while I work, and the way it communicates reports to me is clear and clean.  I love it.  I'm using an AMD Phenom triple-core PC with 8 GB of RAM, and Windows 7 64-bit version. Installation was simple and quick, lasting about 5 minutes.

Even for the advanced users who like to tweak the settings, there are a good number of settings you can tweak.  You can choose if you want security software drivers to load as soon as the computer starts (for Extra Security), only have main drivers load at startup, or have drivers load after the OS has completed loading (for Extra Performance).  You can also set a password to prevent any changes to the Trend Micro software settings.

There are two tools:
Parental Controls and Data Theft Prevention.  Both easy to get to, setup, and turn on/off.

There are four main menus:
Virus & Spyware Controls: containing ""Scan Preferences"" and ""Scheduled Scans""
Internet & Email Controls: containing ""Web Threats"", ""Spam & Emailed Files"", and ""Network""
Exception Lists: containing ""Programs/folders"" and ""Websites""
Other Settings: containing ""System Startup"", ""Proxy Settings"", ""Password"", and ""UI Skinning""

The Web Threats above seems to work with Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. No mention of any other browser. UI Skinning allows you to change the look of the main console.

I've been using Trend Micro for about 4 years now.  I've tried Kaspersky Internet Security, McAfee, Norton 360, and Computer Associates before I started Trend Micro.  I prefer Trend Micro over all of the others because of the speed of installation, the ease of using the software, and the ease of uninstalling, if necessary. For me, it runs quicker than the other internet security/total security packages.  But I don't use Trend Micro exclusively. I like to sample different security packages to see improvements companies make in their products.  Kaspersky works second best for me.

UPGRADE

As an upgrade from Vista Home Premium, it was seemless. I first used Windows 7 Adviser (download available free from Microsoft) to see which version of Windows 7 is right for me. One cannot upgrade willy nilly from any version of Windows to any version of Windows 7. Then, I used Windows Easy Transfer to migrate my data to an external hard drive. I don't think I needed Easy Transfer for the upgrade from Vista, but it came in useful later, when I had to do a clean install.

Upgrading went very smoothly. I retained all my software and settings. I really loved how easy it was.

WINDOWS EASY TRANSFER

It may interest some of you to know sysprep will not work on a computer with an OEM version of Vista with a paid upgrade to Windows 7. I could not even perform a Windows repair with the full version disk. Nope. Once I changed out my motherboard and CPU, I had to use this full version to do a clean install, after which I ran Windows Easy Transfer. Windows Easy Transfer did not restore all my software or even my email settings, but I did give me back my wallpaper.

CLEAN INSTALL

I had to do a few clean installs: the first time after upgrading my motherboard and CPU, the second time after upgrading my hard drive (cloning the old drive failed and my disk backup image did not work). I know, I should have done it all at once.

The first clean install was flawless. The second clean install was fraught with problems. Windows would not let me repair nor do a clean install. ""On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT disks."" Lots of googling to solve this problem, and I did not find anything like what I finally did: I went to the ""advanced"" screen of the Windows setup screen and deleted all the partitions. That worked.

WINDOWS 7 VS. WINDOWS 8 AND VISTA

Compared to Vista, Windows 7 is very familiar. It feels stable. I haven't had it lock up or anything. I like the taskbar on the bottom of the screen. I like being able to see small screenshots of my work by hovering over the icons there. I like anchoring my most used software there.

We do have Windows 8 at home and I chose not to upgrade to that. Windows 8 is very cluttered and clunky. Everything takes far too many clicks, like taking a roundabout route just to turn off the machine. I consider Windows 8 a downgrade.

Bought Quicken 2013 as an upgrade to Quicken 2011. Also bought it a few months after its release (Feb 01) to avoid the usual issues needing patches.
The upgrade is Quicken 2013 R10.
-The install and upgrade was flawless. All data converted 100%.
-The cash flow function (in/out/whats left) was still in the program. Quicken 2011 was a different story, until it was patched back in. This function in my opinion is the best information window in Quicken. It is my opening window. Tied with scheduled transactions it a very effective aid in expense control.
-The budgeting function does seem to be much improved and a bit easier to use.
- Intuit seems to have put a routine in the program to fix issues with ""one step update"" not working/connecting.
It did connect one of my bank accounts, (after asking),  that had been removed because of connection issues.
One step update has been the only major recurring issue I have had with Quicken. The online Tech support has been good at resolving the issue when it occurs. I hope this apparent routine intuit has added goes a long way to resolving the issues with ""one step update"".
-PDA support I do not use at present so I have nothing to report on this new feature.
-Overall its the same core program with no major interface changes, thus no learning curve for existing users.

Overall this is by far the best upgrade experience and least problematic one I have had. It was good that I waited a few months before upgrading to get a great functioning patched (R10) product.

-It offers a computer resources control.
-It offers a battery saving option.
-In the protection center it has off options for certain categories, but out of the box the full protection is on and for most, those  defaults will be fine.

I failed, but not because of Rosetta Stone. I really thought I could master Mandarin as I previously learned German in college and became fluent in Spanish and lived in Latin America for eight years. I assumed learning Chinese would be a similar process.

Rosetta Stone does a great job on their language learning product. The software installed flawlessly on my iMac, registered quickly and I was up and running in short order. The program method is interesting in that it provides graphic scenarios with spoken conversation that the student is tested on for comprehension and repeating with feedback on both. This was nothing like I had experienced with German or Spanish which were largely based on vocabulary, dialogues, sentence structure, verb tenses and the like. Rosetta Stone is more like ""total immersion"" where the student is exposed to the language from the git go with repetitive phrases and progress feedback.

My operational experience with the program was flawless but I became frustrated very early on with my inability to distinguish the subtle differences among the Chinese words. After many sessions of null progress I elected to put it aside until I could find a Community College program where I could get face to face interaction with (hopefully) a native speaker(s) and use Rosetta Stone to augment the instruction.

If you have the ability to determine subtle differences in tonal changes you may find success with Rosetta Stone Chinese. If you are like me, who can't tune an instrument other than a radio, you may want to consider this program as a valuable adjunct to classroom instruction.

I began using it in 1990 when it was Norton Commander - a menu system for DOS -  and stuck with it through almost all its incarnations. At some point, maybe seven or eight years ago, it became bloated and I began using free products, which worked fine without slowing the computer to a crawl - but I missed the full scans and features in Norton that I always found so trustworthy.

Six years ago, I switched to a Mac and didn't go back to Norton. I used nothing for a while since Macs are less likely to be hacked, but that made me very nervous. I installed the free version of Avast and used it until a Mac-savvy friend who was trying to speed my old Mac back up told me I really needed Norton for Mac. (Indeed there was a disk-filling virus in that machine that only Norton was able to catch - Avast was unaware of it.) He told me to run full scans regularly - not just the quickies - and I did that, too.)

When I got a new Mac earlier this year, my Norton was expiring so I went back to Avast for a while. It's good - it caught a virus, in fact, and does a lot of what Norton does - but it slows the computer considerably.  Now I have Norton in my new Mac and things are running very smoothly. The days of bloat are gone. Norton runs fast and clean and even the in-depth scans don't take too long - or slow the machine perceptibly.

Time Machine has been a fantastic feature to have, painlessly backing up data for me in the background and saving me the trouble of doing so manually.  Typically it does so with no additional drag on the responsiveness of the computer (which is several years old, and I tend to run a lot of programs at a time) though occasionally if I've left it unhooked from the external drive for an extended period and it has a lot to sort through the responsiveness will slow for a minute or two while it catches up.

It backed up all the programs and all the music, videos, photos and documents.  When I ran a restore after getting a new internal hard drive in the iMac, the iMac with the new hard drive was just like it was the night before the hard drive died (except the photo on the desktop was not on the desktop, but still in iPhoto).  I did not have to re-install and update any programs.  All I needed was the Leopard install disk (see update below) and the Time Machine external hard drive.  It took 5 hours to restore everything (193 GB), once I attached the external Time Machine drive to the fixed iMac.

That means if your Mac was lost or stolen, or if your internal hard drive died, you could have ""your old"" computer back as soon as you replaced either the computer or the hard drive.

PS  The iMac was ready with the new hard drive in 24 hours with Applecare.  It turns out that *if* I could not give up the computer right then, I could have bought an external hard drive (""Drive B"" let's call it) and restored to Drive B from the Time Machine backup drive (using the iMac), and I could have started the iMac from that external Drive, at least until I could live without the iMac long enough to get a new internal hard drive.  Same goes for a Macbook, I suppose.

The moral of this story is to use Time Machine and an external hard drive to back up your Mac!  It is so little hassle to back up and such a huge benefit to have.  (Our hard drive was six months old when it died, and it lived a much easier life than a hard drive in a laptop.)  If your hard drive died, you could be back up in 30 hours with a new internal hard drive or 6 hours with a temporary external hard drive (including an hour to go buy the temporary external drive).

My wife's Mom does not have much on her iMac that she cares about keeping.  I did not set up Time Machine  on her computer when I installed Leopard on it.  But after I have used Time Machine for a full restore, it would be so easy to restore her computer to exactly the way she is used to it, that I got an external hard drive for her computer and set her up with Time Machine.

(For your friends with Windows computers:  At the office I use a backup program for Windows called Vice Versa that is  available to download.  Vice Versa is for backing up to external drives, which we do automatically every night, keeping the newest one off-site.  There is also Mozy for Windows, which backs up online and, in theory, is the easiest solution.  But Mozy is slow, even with a cable modem, and you have to pay every year.  A Mozy restore is very, very slow.  Backing up a Mac with a .mac account might be like Mozy.  I never did it.)

Backing up always used to be a hassle.  With Time Machine the only hassle is getting the external drive ($100 to $200) and setting up Time Machine once.  This is such a small hassle and expense for the huge benefit, that it is crazy not to use Time Machine with an external drive. It is worth getting Leopard to get Time Machine.

Note, when you max out the backup hard drive, Time Machine gives you options for deleting unnecessary files, so you don't have to start a new backup drive when the first one is full.  A great feature.

Also, on the 3-year old iMac with OC 10.3, Leopard (OS X v. 10.5) ran much, much faster than version 10.3.  I did not perceive any speed difference from version 10.4 on the six-month-old iMac, nor on two Macbooks running v. 10.4, each less than a year old.

8/08 update.  To do a full restore you need to have the OSX DVD and, for a Mac Air, the outboard DVD player.  We were in Berkeley, needed to do a full restore on a Mac Air, had the backup hard drive, but not the OSX DVD.  Went to Emoryville Apple Store.  Would not loan me a OSX DVD to do the restore.  Did not have any OSX DVDs in stock, so I could not buy one, either. Said that Apple would mail a restore disc to me if I called them, but I had the OSX disk at home in L.A. and needed to use the DVD that day.  (It is the same version of the same OS that came with every Mac Air, so I could not have been sneaking an upgrade.)  Best Buy was out of the OSX DVDs, too, so I could not perform the full restore.  I consider this horrible customer service. Also, the OSX DVD should be optional to do a full restore.  It might make for a cleaner install of the OS, but you should be able to restore without the OSX DVD if you don't have it with you.  And an Apple store should loan you a copy if you already bought the Apple computer, have applecare for the computer, and are not in your home city.

Also, I was 20 minutes late for my Genius Bar appointment in the Emoryville store (the closest Apple store to Berkeley by car -- there is no Apple store within walking distance of the Berkeley campus.  The closest store by Bart is in SF!) on a Sat. afternoon and they refused to help me.  They said make a new appointment for another day and by the way we are booked all weekend.  I begged and my niece begged.  People canceled their times while I stood there and they would not give me the spot, told me to wait until all the people with later appointments were helped (that is, spend the rest of the day and evening waiting for them to -- possibly -- fit me in).  Zero customer service. I was appalled.  I needed a Time Capsule for my niece but I went to Best Buy to get it because I really did not want to spend a penny at the Emoryville store.  But the next morning I needed the OSX DVD (see above).  The store did not redeem itself.

Bottom line is that I love the OS, love Time Machine, and had TWO back-to-backreally bad experiences at the Emorville Apple store, one of which could have been avoided if Time Machine did not require an OSX DVD to perform a full install, or if Apple stores would loan computer owners a copy to perform the full restore.",Get it for Time Machine!,1198454400,3,

Old review: I have run only Norton antivirus products for the past 14 years, so I was hesitant but excited to compare Bitdefender when given the opportunity. My grandparents' computer was the perfect test subject. Comparisons are with Norton Internet Security 2008 which was previously loaded on the computer:

Bit defender installed easily without any problems, unlike many other reviewers' experiences. Make sure you have completely uninstalled all other antivirus software packages before installing bitdefender in order to avoid problems.

The program make little or no noticeable impact that I can discern on the speed of the computer while running in the background. However, I did not really have any issues with speed running Norton either. The complete scan seems to take longer than Norton to run.

Bitdefender seems to be a little easier for to customize, which is saying a lot since I am obviously familiar with Symantec configurations and was able to customize bitdefender's options with ease; very intuitive. If you have no desire or ability to autoconfigure; the default settings are load without asking a lot of confusion questions and seem to be appropriate for the average user.

The ultimate test for an Antivirus/firewall package is whether or not it protects against viruses and doesn't misidentify things that aren't viruses. I have never had a virus on any computer that I have had running an up-to-date Symantec product. It's hard to judge Bitdefender on this criteria by simply installing it. However, as I look at independent laboratory's assessments of the product, it fails to get 100% marks that characterize most of the other major Internet Security/Antivirus packages, whereas Symantec products regularly get 100% of viruses facing it. Generally, Bitdefender failed by misidentifying things as viruses which were not in the tests that I read.

I have not had any noticeable infiltrations on any of the machines, 1 XP pro laptops 1 XP pro tablet and 1 media PC tower, that it has been installed on.  In the past, I have predominantly used Norton products, but realized that it had a tendency to significantly reduce the performance of all machines I have installed them on.  AV suites are about as much protection as possible, but when my performance is cut almost in half, I had to look for an alternative.  Though I have used many different anti-virus and internet security suites over the years (Kaspersky, Trend Micro, AVG, etc.), for the purposes of this review, I am comparing only McAfee and Norton as I installed McAfee over the Norton installations.

Comparing the two, they have both worked well for me.  The main difference between McAfee and Norton is that McAfee is much more hands off.  Use the installer and the most current package is downloaded and then installed.  Once installed, it does its thing with very little setup or configuration.  Conversely, Norton came with a full version on the cd and after the install it asks to download the latest definitions and updates.  This route of install definitely took longer; and with the prevalence of high speed internet access that isn't that big of a deal --- of course it would be a big deal if you are still on dial up.  Norton also has a lengthy configuration process and while it ""learns"" your habits, pop ups and config questions constantly come on asking you to proceed, block, allow, accept, etc.  Not a big deal if you are fairly comfortable with computers, but people like my dad that only has basic skills were always afraid of doing the wrong thing so the first month I would always get a call asking me what to do.

In short, I like McAfee.  It works well and is easier to install and live with.  I would like a little more control over specific functions and task, that Norton does, but the ease of use and performance increase is well worth the sacrifice.",Comparison of Norton vs. McAfee,1250726400,,

An interface that sucks being your only option across desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, and gaming console. The key words aren't, in deference to the Windows 8 fanboys, ""only option"". The real fighting words are ""that sucks.""
Some people do not feel that way, but then again they think every trend is a good one-and I saw some trends during my time in school that have me ready to deliver TKOs to innocent objects when I think back on them, and the same is true with Windows 8.
As it was with Vista, and they share important qualities. They were ever more refined implementations of a certain highly distasteful vision of computing. One that Steve Jobs did both infinitely better and equally horrid at doing simultaneously given the appropriate tools.
For this to work, it has to work better than s***. Which, despite a Start butt on, as opposed to what you get with Windows 7, is NOT the case. It's flat, colorless, atrocious, and despite all that I would be willing to put up with it if I could get the right PC to run it on.
The key is on it you spend all your time in the Metro UI and don't play music since the default Windows Metro music playing application is more limited in function than a hood ornament on a fancy vintage car-and also only venturing to the desktop when you need to change a desktop only located setting, and using free apps as much as you can.
(If I am going to pay money for apps, Apple will get my money because they're full-featured desktop applications with their only disadvantage being they're distributed like apps.)
I don't want 16-color display on a monitor supporting millions of colors, and that's why I compromised and went for 7. I gave up on the third-generation Core i3, gave up on integrated Bluetooth, but don't have Vista 2.0 or 2.1 related headaches either in the user interface or in the background processes carrying out intense extracurricular activities.
Instead I have Vista 1.1, which has a halfway tolerable amount of extracurricular activities and a UI that makes Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows 8 Pro or even Enterprise look like bloated unruly pigs.
It's not that Windows 8 sucks, it's that the vision that caused it to come to pass sucks, and not even in theory but merely in practice.
Oddly enough, I do like Metro on an Xbox-and don't give me the crap about how Windows 8 turns your computer into an Xbox. Because you have top-flight for the era graphics hardware in a gaming console and you often have graphics that are crap when it comes to games in a PC because they're different devices. With different target markets when comparing low-end PCs to gaming consoles.
And it also works well on the Windows RT Microsoft Surface (the Surface Pro has full PC power, and so that comparison falls flat, as it does with all the other permutations of laptops and desktops), but on phones, laptops, desktops, and full PC or even Atom ULCPC tablet systems Metro does not work-you want Windows 7 and Microsoft won't allow it because they want to increase the level of Vistafication and force you to accept it or push you off the Internet.
I'm about to go off the Internet before I'll adopt Vista 2.0 in the guise of the Windows 8 family, but then again I want to confirm what I have been reading. (But budget restrictions will likely nix it.)",The fanboys and haters are both right! Just not completely.,1384992000,3,

Facing increasing pressure to get ""something"" out the door, and having gone through several failed attempts to unleash a modern operating system to replace the aging, original Macintosh operating system, Apple threw OS X (10.0) at dedicated Mac users as, essentially, a pay-to-play beta test.

The program was easy to install and I encountered no errors.  On one laptop it actually found several viruses that the Iolo product had missed.

The software is modern in its approach to installation: you don't even get a disc in the box, you get a card with a key code and the URL of the site to set up a Norton account and download the latest installer. That's perfect for my Mac Mini, which has no disc drive!

That's the good news. The bad news is that the installer hiccuped before things went right. I kept getting an error trying to run the downloaded package and had to use their 24/7 support chat feature. I was on hold for about 15 minutes waiting (even though I was ""number 1 in the queue"") but eventually a support rep came on and used a remote control feature to actually install the app for me using an alternative method.

Afterward, the interface was nice and familiar. I could open the virus scanner and download updates, start a scan, etc. In fact, a scan is running right now and it doesn't seem to have affected performance on the machine.

The other bad thing is that it automatically tries to install a browser extension, which isn't a big deal by itself, but it causes a pop-up asking you to use their SafeSearch feature powered by Ask.com (which I'd never do because I prefer Google for search). You can close the pop-up, but the ""No Thanks"" link is non-functional, so you get the pop-up again on every page you visit until you uninstall the browser extension. Weak!

This Nancy Drew game is about a young rich girl who had her father restore an old train back to working condition.  There are many rumors surrounding this train - especially since the original owner wound up missing in the mid 1800's, and his engineer was found still in the train, in the middle of the desert, dead...  On top of this, the owners wife had died on the train at an earlier date, so many people thought it was haunted.

The reason the young girl had wanted the train restored was because story had it that Jack Hurley (the original owner), had found gold in a mine - and that the directions to find this mine were all hidden inside the train.  She wanted this treasure, and invited several people (including Nancy and the Hardy boys) to help solve the mysteries, and find the mine.

I was pleased with the wide variety of content and the adaptability of the game. If you put the cartridge into your Explorer and have your game settings adjusted to the age of the player, it automatically selects activity levels that are appropriate for the player's age. My 7, 5 and 3 year old daughters were all able to fully enjoy the game.
In fact, they fought so much over the cartridge that we decided that buy the download for them so they could all play at the same time while on a road trip.
The only drawback with the cartridges is that you can lose them very easily (as my kids often do) and only one child at a time can play.
The downloads cost about the same amount as the cartridge(unless it's on sale) but with the download, the game stays on their device and you can load it to all of your children's gaming devices instead of just one at a time.
Overall, I'm still not a fan of the cartridges for those reasons. We definitely prefer the downloads.

SketchBook Pro successfully combines power and simplicity into one package, such that even a weak artist can be productive and successful.

I ran into a problem when installing the application - the installer crashed, giving some odd internal error and number. I tried again immediately and the second try went without a hitch. I assume it is a configuration issue with my system as I have occasional strange issues when installing software.

When first launched, the application asks if you have your serial number and key handy. If you are new to SketchBook Pro, I encourage you NOT to enter them just yet but instead specify that you want a 15-day trial. The reason is that you get presented a quick pictoral tour of the feature set when you run in trial mode (which is really just a time-limited demo mode with everything enabled), which is a nice introduction. Afterward, registration information can be entered through the help menu.

Being new to SketchBook Pro myself, I was startled by the sparse interface when opening a new canvas. There was little on the screen other than the main menu up top and the lagoon in the lower left. Most drawing applications clutter the screen with an assortment of toolbars, palettes, wizards and other things that just get in the way. Autodesk keep their application simple instead, putting the essentials out there and leaving everything else off the screen until it's really needed.

Most elements of the application are available in radial menus, accessible either through clicking on icons on the lagoon or right-clicking on the canvas. All menu items have help tips to guide along the way so you know what option you're choosing. Radial menus can be a surprise to those who have never been exposed to them, but once used to them they are very powerful and easy to use.

Plunging into the various options available, I immediately discovered a couple of things I have never before used in drawing applications. First, I discovered the symmetry options, which makes creating mirror images easy. Using the axis, I was able to draw a crude figure of a person in about 10 seconds without even expending any real thought. Even more productive for me, though, was the ruler, especially in combination with the layering tool. The ruler is a slight misnomer, as it is actually more of a straight-edge against which to draw straight lines.

Another interesting surprise was the help system. When I launched the help system, rather than bring up a compiled help file, my default web browser launched and I was presented with one of the best help systems I have seen. The help is easy on the eyes and very straightforward to use. There is sufficient detail with pictures to address almost any conceivable question that might arise.

SketchBook Pro is very fast and very responsive on my system. I am running Vista with 3GB of ram and a dual-core 2.1G Intel processor, and there is only the slightest hint of hesitation on rare occasion.

Having never played with SketchBook Pro before and being a poor artist, I was shocked that I could create viable results in minutes. In the hands of a professional artist, this is a powerful and easy-to-use package.

So I have quite a bit of experience with the operating system.  Let's get to the nitty gritty:

Should you upgrade from Windows Vista?  YES!  I mean it - upgrade today.
Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use.  Even the preproduction version of Windows 7 was better than my Vista with SP2.

Should you upgrade from Windows XP? Maybe, but for different reasons.
XP is a good operating system and if you don't need to add new hardware or software, XP is good.  However, XP is old as an operating system.  Also chances are that if you're running XP, you might not meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 - check the compatibility site at Microsoft to see if your system will support Windows 7.  That said, Windows 7 is light years ahead of Windows XP in terms of functionality, ease of use, etc - to me it's worth buying a new system.

64 bit or 32 bit?
If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's ok skip this section.  If you have a core2 duo or core 2 quad or a multi cpu machine, go with the 64 bit OS, it handles memory and the CPUs much better.  If you have a single core CPU, one CPU or run special programs that require 32bit, then stick with 32 bit for now.

BEFORE INSTALLATION:
I recommend you have:
-a core 2 duo or core 2 quad machine
-4gig of RAM (That's about $50 in today's market)
-good hard drive with (200 gig - it doesn't need that much but that's another $50)
-back up your files to a USB drive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Digital-My-Passport-Essential-500-GB-USB-2-0-Portable-External-Hard-Drive-WDME5000TN-Midnight-Black/dp/B001F9LY14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive WDME5000TN (Midnight Black)</a>
-check to make sure your computer is compatible with Windows 7

INSTALLATION:
Installation was very straight forward.  You put in the CD and reboot your machine.  You might have to enter your bios and enable the ""boot from CD"" option.  Once the machine reboots a nice screen comes up to guide you through the installation.  You have the option to upgrade your PC or do a clean installation.  I did an upgrade and it brought in all of my files and settings from my windows Vista system.  It worked great.
The upgrade did take about 2 hours for me so definitely consider.
I noticed that early on in the installation the operating system went out to Microsoft's site to look for the latest and greatest updates, so I think this should  help Microsoft respond quickly to any hiccups with compatibility.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
The driver from my old HP Inkjet printer for 2001 doesn't work on Windows 7 so there are some things that will not transition.  I had to use a generic HP driver which doesn't give me the quality that I got from an injet - so overall, I'm up and running with that printer but I'm degraded on the inkjet front.  That said, I recently upgraded to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-CP2025DN-Color-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B001F0RI1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP CP2025DN Color LaserJet Printer</a>&nbsp;that I love so no real loss there.  I'll likely pick up a cheap inkjet for the occasional photo that I might need to print.  Everything else upgraded.

BENEFITS
-faster boot time
-faster go to sleep
-faster wakeup
-faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista - seriously (but those are my results without any benchmarks or anything like that, just seeing how fast Adobe Illustrator loads, and how fast all the applications respond)
-joining wireless networks is much easier
-the interface is just plain beautiful
-my wallpapers are now a slideshow that can be set to change every few minutes (I'm not stuck with the same picture)
-Gadgets - these are wonderful little small applications that you can drag onto your desktop.  I have a weather gadget and a calendar gadget on my desktop that tell me
-Better taskbar management - hovering over the taskbar icons shows me mini windows of what's running
-Better file management - I can organize my files into Libraries that are sortable not only by type but by folder or other data.  It's great!  I can browse through my presentations or illustrator files!
-Windows Media appears to be smoother which I love.
-You get some virus protection and firewall with Windows 7 but consider something more comprehensive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Total-Protection-3User-2010/dp/B002GUUO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Total Protection 3User 2010</a>. Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but

CONS:
- Some older programs might not work and some drivers might not be available like my inkjet driver.
- Other than that, there aren't too many drawbacks to Windows 7 - it's a great OS.

WHICH VERSION SHOULD I GET?
I got the ultimate version because I have clients who ask, ""is your hard drive encrypted?"" -- I wanted to be able to say yes and have sensitive data encrypted one of my computer volumes - Bitlocker is only available in the Ultimate version.  Ultimate also includes Multilanguage support.

If you're a home user that doesn't do a lot of networking, you might consider just the home premium edition.  If you're using a laptop and connect to networks at work, you might want the Professional version of the operating system to help you with domain joining.  Also Windows Professional gives you the option to run applications in XP mode so if you have old applications you can use that nifty feature.  I already have 1 application running in XP mode - it's nifty to run an old application.

NOTE:
The box contains both the 32 bit and 64 bit OS.

OVERALL:
It's very hard to write a comprehensive review on an entire operating system so I didn't even try - I'm sure magazines will devote entire articles to the operating system and several books will come out.  My goal here is just to give everyone a glimpse of what I've found to date with this new OS. I do hope this has helped you in making a decision.

I upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking ""all apps,"" I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the ""all apps"" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove items which made the list, but not add back the missing stuff (except by a torturous series of edits using ""regedit,"" which Microsoft has hidden to discourage use of this very dangerous utility).

Microsoft is obsessed with the ""tiles"" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the ""all apps"" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the ""all apps"" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.). Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

Edge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.

Still, only one of my programs available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered. Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.

I suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others). If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.

UPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the ""programs"" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).

UPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who ""upgraded"" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.

UPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called ""Threshold Update""which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a ""service Pack,"" or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.

UPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called ""anniversary update"" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). For the past 11 months I installed and utilized ""Classic Shell,"" a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay have rendered the Classic Shell incompatible. Thus, those who preferred the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are stuck with the latest abomination.

The folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by the user  (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded programs). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless does not allow to be selected as the default security program.  And the ""no firewall"" doomsday message continues to appear.

Since installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed grudgingly to learn to live with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC), to somehow find my way through the cluttered and sometimes vague Settings menu, to locate and adjust to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction.

When I first installed it and found that the (controversial) ribbon from Office 2007 for PC wasn't there, I felt like I had been cheated somehow.  However, as I used Office for Mac more, I found that the ribbon was the least of my worries.  I have two primary criticisms...

First, Office 2008 is exceedingly slow.  I have a 3.06GHz C2D iMac with 4Gb RAM and this is, without doubt, the slowest launching program I have.  Even after multiple updates, it's still 2-3x slower than Pages on first launch.  Furthermore, while using the program, actions like autocorrection, etc take almost a full second to implement, during which time Office stops responding graphically (it's actually working, just not displaying anything until it churns through the autocorrect, after which it ""speed types"" in what was in the buffer).

Second, the Thesaurus is also particularly disapppointing, since it doesn't seem to be able to sense the forms of words.  Many ""-ing"" words show their root in the thesaurus, which you then use to find a synonym and, after inserting, you have to go back and manually change the form.  Ridiculous.

Third, there appears to be a bug (perhaps related to the autocorrect lag) where changes to a document sometimes cause a ""visual corruption.""  It's difficult to explain, but an example would be where a significant amount of text is changed from double-space to singe-space.  After doing so, it is entirely possible to have a ""phantom"" sentence on the page that disappears if you scroll up then back down.  It's almost as if Word correctly moved everything, but forgot to update the screen to show the changes.

There are several other problems that I just don't have the heart to detail here (some of them are personal frustrations with design decisions).  The bottom line, however, is that this is the first Office suite in 15 years that I have wished I could ""unbuy.""  There are too many ""annoyances"" here.  It could be that I use documents between Office 2007 on a PC and 2008 on a Mac, but shouldn't there be 100% compatibility. Perhaps the 2011 version will be better, but for the time being, this is the single most frustrating piece of software I currently have on my iMac, primarily because I know how well it works on the PC side.

I'm unaware of the history/reason my software, which was released just a few months ago, is already replaced -- too many errors? recall? Not sure.

Anyway ... this is a decent piece of software, not great. I agree with a lot of the complaints on the Amazon reviews - no product support, virus protection lacks (lots of false positives), and reports are not terribly useful. There are also some problems registering the product - they *really* want you to buy a new box every time, for every computer, which always causes problems.

My big problem with Kaspersky is a hint of greed behind the product line -- anybody who puts excessive protections on their software, at the expense of consumer convenience, has profit (not functionality or customer satisfaction) as their #1 goal. This hunch is reinforced by their lack of support - after you buy it, they seem not to care if it works for you.

But my BIGGEST problem with this, is that anti-virus protection should be free. If Kaspersky really believes in investing energy into this product, they should make it free to consumers and charge for upgrades/advances applications (such as network and business accounts). The fact is, this is already the business model for the top rated antivirus softwares.

So here's my recommendation: Get a free antivirus. The best one right now, according to reviews of the experts, is Avast. I've never had problems with Avast (except that it wants to update too often, but it only takes a few seconds). I used to run AVG, and loved it, but the new version is too clunky, lots of crashes.

*Everybody* should be running a hosts file, which Kaspersky completely ignores. The best currently is ""hostsman"" (and yes, it's free too).

And for firewall, the most recent IT studies say that the Windows XP or Vista firewall works as well as any other. It's free, and chances are you already have it. If you're running Me, 2000, or earlier, try ZoneEdit (also free).

If you're running Vista, you may want to try some of their built-in safeguards. I tried Vista for a while, and went back to XP (too clunky). But if you're on Vista, it's got some pretty decent safeguards already, and may not work well with 3rd party software.

My bottom line is, the computer is a tool which I want to *work* when I turn it on, not spend time or energy cleaning up viruses or other crap, and I should have to spend a fortune protecting it.

While there are one or two nice improvements added, Corel has not added a remarkable improvement since they bought the rights to WordPerfect in 1996&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Wordperfect-Suite-8-Professional/dp/B001DWKH66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Wordperfect Suite 8 Professional</a>. Those comfortable with MS Word, Excel or OneNote should  examine the benefits versus the drawbacks of using WordPerfect and Quattro Pro as  primary applications. Version X8 is stable, lightweight and less resource-hungry than Libreoffice. I found it to be slightly more responsive than Some of the Office 365 apps like Word and OneNote. I have not had reliable success converting Word or Excel documents to either Wordperfect or Quattro Pro. Quattro Pro interprets formulae and functions in its own way so excel users may have to relearn everything. On the other hand, Wordperfect is a stable program . Three stars because this version has few additional features and has not really changed much. What does Corel say?

Here's what Corel claims is ""new"" and worth the price:

1). 3 Templates (one each) for formatting a document in APA, MLA or University of Chicago format. These are available in the Perfect Expert application and must be downloaded before using them.
2). ""Enhanced reveal codes"" adds an additional button to the WordPerfect Toolbar and the ability to display the codes panel on either the right, left or bottom of the text editing window.
3). ""Enhanced Undo"" allows a user to  reverse up to 100 (10 default setting) previous actions including undeleting text or reversing a hard return.
4) Configure specific hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts for your own use/preference.
5).""Template Preview"" allows a user to see a thumbnail image of a finished template in the create new template menu box (File=>New from Template).

Of these features, only the APA/MLA templates and the ability to move the codes dock are new in this version of the Suite. The actual functionality of reveal codes remains the same as in previous versions. Moving the codes window from bottom to either side is a hassle when writing.

I do like this upgrade and would definitely say it is worth a look (but probably not a ""buy""). It is good for me. Users of Microsoft Office and other modern suites should be careful before jumping in and buying the product. The following are some slightly negative aspects of WordPerfect X8 Home and Student (may not apply to the professional edition):

1). No PDF or Legal functionalities. A document may be printed to PDF (as in any other program such as notepad, wordpad) but there is no way to import a PDF.
2). Collaboration features consist of importing a file to WPD, comparing the document to another imported document and then exporting both documents back to the original format to be sent back to their original source. Another painful hassle.
3). No features for direct collaboration with Word, Kingsoft or Google Docs/Drive (direct collaboration only available for other Wordperfect users/document)
4). No mail/calendar feature.
5). No support for MacOS.
6). Cannot directly view or edit an HTML document or interpret XML code for editing (without compiling a specific Document Type Definition and creating a new template specifically for that XML type)
7). Only two legal templates (one memo and one numbered sheet) and one project template for creating a legal time sheet.
8). The reveal codes pane is very unattractive in ""Classic mode"" (WP DOS mode) and makes for a very cluttered screen.
9). Word and LibreOffice formats do not convert accurately. Basically, you can destroy an entire Word or Libreoffice manuscript by converting it to Wordperfect and/or converting it back again.
10). Customizers will spend hours with the XML project designer just to get basic work done
10). No eBook formatting.
11). No cloud-based version of the programs, cloud storage and syncing or blogging features.
12). No support for 64-bit processors.

I recommend this release for long-time or established users of WordPerfect but would not recommend it to users most familiar with application suites like Word, Excel, Outlook/Kingsoft Office/LibreOffice. Conversion to Word and odt (LibreOffice) is fair to poor and the conversion/import process has the tendency to mangle formatting and add extra characters and symbols to formatted lists, text with headings and even basic formatting like a 5-space indent or italicized or bold  text. In long documents it is very difficult to hunt down all of the extra characters and errant formatting and to correct each instance of a conversion error.

I totally understand the religious following of this product and I understand the feelings, but everything gets down to ""Do you want workable skills for a job?"" If the answer is no, the fiddling with Wordperfect and Quattro may be for you.

I am presently using WordPerfect X8 Home and Student for my daily work on Windows 10.  I do like Lightning (notetaking app). Home and casual users may find WordPerfectX8 interesting for the attractive new program icons (a blue circle for WP and a green circle for Quattro) and some of the new templates.

I use to do computer graphics and fine arts more than a decade ago, but I don't work in that field, and so I only actually need to use a high end graphics program every few months or so.  I've used Photoshop for more than 10 years, but now that Adobe has gone to Creative Cloud with a monthly rental but no purchase option, I need an alternative.  I don't do graphics often enough to justify a monthly fee on the Adobe Creative Cloud plan, and I have concerns about whether I will be able to open files years into the future unless I can own the software.  My personal alternative is the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GIMP has a clunky user interface.  And, I also recommend software for a small university library where students and staff are also looking for something for occasional use.

Corel Painter 2015 has a decent user interface.  I was able to do simple edits quickly and intuitively.  I was also able to use the User Guide to quickly find and follow instructions for applying a mask.  There are a lot of options, because you can do a lot for it, so I think it's better for someone who has used a high-end graphics program before or who wants to be able to do more.  It was easy to find instructions for using the software.  There is a big long PDF User Guide, tutorials on YouTube (this is officially how Corel makes the tutorials available), and by Googling I could find websites where people talked about using the software.  So, you will be able to quickly find instructions on doing common tasks in Corel Painter.  One thing that bothers me is that the user guide is an included PDF, so I will have it as long as I have the Corel Painter CD, but the tutorials are made available as YouTube videos.  I won't necessarily be able to go back to a tutorial a few years from now, since I can't store them with the software.

All in all, this is perfectly adequate software for editing digital images, and has a range that goes all the way up to fine arts.  There is a 30 day free trial to demo the software, and you can get this from Corel's website to try the software out.","Solid, intuitive, well documented;  Let's me buy once, and avoid the Creative Cloud",1413072000,,

This version does work, and it converted my 2004 QBs well.

Almost all of my sales are online and to new people most of the time. This new QBs has you put in a default name for the shipping address, only an annoyance to me. I can see why some might like this. I'd rather see QBs volunteer the name of the account and the new, added name so I could just get on with it.

I keep my account names last name comma first name style. I would imagine that everyone would if you have a lot of account names. It annoys me to have to manually edit the display name when there could be an option to do that for me automatically. This is an example of something that seems to go on forever and never change.

I do find a little more flexibility in filtering reports than what I am used to.

All the nit picking aside, QBs remains the best and most cost effective accounting program for me.

I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!
I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a ""power user,"" especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.
One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable. For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available. Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!
In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable! You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.
The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it ""thinks"" you will need at the moment. It is rarely right! ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier! There is one small ""tool bar"" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons. It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.
Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!
Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the ""improved"" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!
To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!
Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)
For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.
I have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case. I believe Microsoft tried to produce something ""different"" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past.

I have sent many requests to Intuit and never once even received an acknowledgement. Now, I cannot even find a way to communicate to Intuit! I can speak up in the ""community"" of other lost and unhappy users, but no more can I just click a link and communicate to Intuit. You try it. I don't know what happened to Intuit, but if I could stop using Quicken I would. Someone needs to make a better Quicken because it seems like every improvement is just more shuffling of menu items and bloat. How about some simple little usability fixes:

1) Allow the resize of the download pane and add some tools to it to select and catagorize and sort. Not even a sort on this window!
2) Renaming is a chore. How about a little help there.
3) Search and replace windows are just too narrow to see the text and yet will not resize. Why? Is this a big probem to create resizable windows. I don't think so.
4) Undo: How about an undo for the simple register mistake? Too much to ask?
5) Pull-down menu items that don't take two or more keystrokes to get a change from.
6) Inappropriate messages that do not relate to the task at hand. Such as asking me if I now want to add the account that I am actually updating.
7) How about not forcing us to upgrade to an even worse implementation by stopping our ability to download transations.
8) Respond to customers or at least let them know with an auto script that you got their email. Something!

In fact, I cannot tell that there is a single improvement over prior editions.  I think Intuit is milking this product for profit rather than investing in it.

For example, for corporations, the Form 1120 defaults to assuming that someone owns 20% or more of the firm, forcing the listing of such people on a form G.  As in years past, you must switch to forms mode, uncheck the box (never offered in the interview) that says someone owns more than 20% of the firm, and then manually delete the G.

The most infuriating thing about the 1120 is that as of yesterday, March 13, you could neither print nor e-file the return - which is due on March 15 (!) - because the TurboTax forms were out of date.  Yet, the iRS released the final 1120 forms on March 1.  How could it possibly take a vastly capitalized corporation like Intuit more than a day to make whatever minor adjustments were in the final forms?  TurboTax did update itself today, March 14, to allow for filing.  Infuriatingly last-minute nonsense.

When e-filing the 1120 today, now that the forms are available, I chose ACH debit (as opposed to EFTPS) to pay the tax due.  On the confirmation screen, TurboTax confirmed that I selected EFTPS (not) with an edit button to change it - clicking the Edit button took me back to the screen showing ACH and the bank routing/account numbers/etc.  Just one of a dozen or more glitchy buggy things.

A cosmetic bug, but one that is disconcerting, is a screen under Federal Review that just says ""This is Heading Text / This is a Subheading""  (screenshot posted with product images above).  Clicking the Federal Review tab again gets the correct page, but, really.

For trusts filing 1041, expenses allocated to income are still not allocated, by default, to interest and dividends (etc) by pro-ration, as is done by most tax preparers, not is there a question or checkbox in the interview to allow for that.  As in years past, all expenses are subtracted against interest, fully, first, then dividends/other income.  You have to switch to forms mode and find the checkbox to manually check to do the allocation as desired.  K-1 allocations are also not complete, with Foreign Tax credit not properly allocated to the beneficiary.

These are just a few of the issues in this clunky, never-improved, Intuit cash-cow.  For folks who are not tax nerds, you should have any return that is prepared by this software reviewed by a tax professional.

Every iteration of this software brings new features, and improved stability - especially for Mac, and this software is for two platforms, including Windows.

You would not paint with your mouse, so you'd need a tablet (I recommend a Wacom (If you have the cash, their Cintiq is amazing, because you are actually painting right on a display of your painting and drawing).  If not, there are some much less expensive tablets that bring a plethora of features as well, like pressure-sensitivity and such. The pens that come with them all have features, as the tablets that are customizable.

I have found that the community of experts, and Corel affiliated Painter masters, are teachers, artists, software creators, and tech people.  They often donate a more than a fair amount of media that they have created, that mimic real world media, and you can load them on your computer.  How would you like to have brushes mimic cloud formations, trees and tree leaves, water, and even skin textures for portraits.  Also, there is a great amount of videos, advice, and demonstrations on their blogs, websites, and You Tube.  I've been taught by several Painter masters in inexpensive classes, as well as one-on-one classes.

When your warranty is up you may renew it.  You can get deals included sometimes with a couple of free hour lessons with a master. Just to let you know, the price may increase as you click on the link, and you need to make sure that you get the special on the page with the link. May have been a bug.

Actually, if you follow these Painter Masters by doing a Google search, and peruse their websites and who they provide links to, you will see some very good resources, at a very low cost or free.  I cannot remember all their names, but WOW! I've found some similar resources for Adobe Photoshop, but this thing with Corel Painter is so special to me. I even have a Master as a private tutor online at a very reasonable price!!

The product interface, features, and tools:

Painter is set up amazingly similar to Photoshop, like dock-able palettes and have many other like features, tools, capabilities; though, Photoshop is not Painter and vice versa.

Painter 2015 has a fun new feature, called particle brushes (so creative), and other new features as well  The previous versions brought features like the Perspective tool, and symmetry tools for those who need help drawing objects like buildings, and reflections in water, for example.  Kaleidoscopes can challenge the talented, even though most anyone can use the Kaleidoscope tool, and have it look Awesome.

Corel, in it's inception, from what I understand, was derived from a different company, and as well as I can remember,  there was a brilliant set of filters, called KPT collection = Kai's power tools.  They were brilliant, and could challenge any brainiac artist with endless possibilities, as well as make non-artists look more talented.  Well, that is how I feel about, for example, the brush creation engine within Painter.  It is so complex, and there are seemingly endless possibilities to customize existing native brushes (there are sooo many of them to begin with) to mimic nature and special effects; in my opinion it is much better than Adobe's current brush-making technology, though I use both, because digital artists are using both, hence it has been worked out that the two are not only used together by Painter masters,  but there are built-in compatibility features, tying them both in together if you will, as with Painter's ability to import Photoshop files.

I am taking more brush-engine classes, mainly because I am interested sunsets, landscapes, atmospheric renderings, and maybe even Aurora Borealis renderings.  If I make my own brushes it will help me to be knowledgeable to not only create what I envision, but know the possibilities and limitations of said brushes. The class is less than $50. In my opinion, this deal is sweet.  You can take online classes for beginners, intermediate, and master classes from Corel training partners.

You can extend your media choices multi-fold, like making and loading new brushes, patterns, papers for textures like real artist's canvas, masks, and much more, even abstract. And, yes, there are layers, masks, and channels, as well as layer settings similar to Photoshop, and Corel's own set of filters from decoration, and special effects, to color correction.

It is impossible for me to say all that this wonderful tool can do in a review, but get prepared to be blown away.  It can be as deep or as shallow as you desire.  Corel's website has a lot of videos, introducing the beginner, and veteran artist/user. Please register your software.

You don't have to be a real artist.  I am a hobbyist, trying to be an artist, but be prepared to be blown away by all things Corel Painter.  It is a deep program. No art supplies necessary, and you have convincing oils, watercolors, gouache, acrylics, pencils, pastels, pens, markers, and much more.

When you open up Painter flip through the many fine art and concept art paintings that are made by masters, some whom you can meet through the internet, or in books about Painter.

Beginners and masters may use the cloning features differently I believe.  Clones of course are copies, and it is difficult to explain in one review, but it takes knowledge of Painter's capabilities to realize that one can use a combination of cloning and talent to make something that one would have to admit, can just take talent, frankly.  Not at all cheating.  Art.  I would name names here, but I would inevitably leave someone out. I have seen that the auto-painting feature can render a photo to look as if it is painted - sort of.  Beginners will have fun, and masters use this feature creatively, and with creative uses of it.

Do I need to say I highly recommend?  Have fun, and save money on art supplies.  The digital art revolution is for traditional artist too (you can mix the media even).  From what I have read, though many artists disagree with, and I agree with, the revolution can be compared to the digital photography revolution, many years ago.

Peterson,"Having been a satisfied user of PaperPort 9 for many years, and after hearing continued horror stories about every subsequent release, it was with great trepidation that I finally decided to upgrade to a newer version.  The upgrade to PP Pro 14.0 went smoothly, and I have used the product daily since then, and despite some quirks and bugs, I am happy that I finally upgraded.

I have used PaperPort 9 extensively since it came out years ago for scanning and organizing virtually all paperwork that comes through my home and office, and it has long been one of the ""must-have"" applications that I use every day.  When I upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 Pro 64 bit, I was dismayed to discover that PP 9 would not run on Windows 7 (nor would my Canon scanner), so I installed VirtualBox and used it to host a virtual Windows XP machine in which I could continue running both PP 9 and my scanner, which actually has worked pretty well.  (I tried the ""XP mode"" in Win 7 but it did not have good USB support that I needed for the scanner.) But PP 9 and my old scanner were aging and becoming more difficult to use for reasons described below, so it was time for an upgrade.

So I finally decided to take a chance and modernize with PP 14 and a new scanner.  Mindful of all the problems some people have reported, before doing the upgrade I took precautions.  To make sure that I could roll everything back if PP 14 messed up my system, I forced an immediate full backup to my Windows Home Server (I HIGHLY recommend anyone who uses Windows to get one of these), and then also set a system restore point in Windows 7 (via Control Panel/System).  This turned out to be unnecessary insurance because the upgrade completed without any problems.

The biggest problem I have had with PP 14 has been just figuring out all of the changes since version 9, which are extensive (and most of which I don't need), and also figuring out how to mate it up with the software for the new Canon scanner that I got to work with it.  Both PP and the scanner have a lot of options - everything seems to get more complicated, not less - and it took me a while to discover the best set of options for each.

Good things:
- The user interface is much more modern looking, and is visually similar to the Microsoft Office 2007 ribbon bar - love it or hate it.
- It is noticeably faster than PP 9, especially when it comes to displaying document thumbnails.  My collection of scanned items is very large, so PP 9 was taking a long time to display any new folder full of documents.  PP 14 is much faster, which alone almost makes the upgrade worthwhile for me.
- It creates and views PDF version 1.7 (the latest version), while PP 9 would only create and view PDF 1.4 (the version used by Acrobat 5).  That limitation in PP 9 was also another major motivator for my upgrade.
- It, together with my new scanner, produces better images, faster than before, and also automatically applies some fixes such as auto-straighten which works very well.
- And it runs natively under Windows 7, allowing me to get rid of the need to start a virtual machine in which to run Windows XP - this was taking a lot of memory, as well as extra time.

Not-so-good things:
- The user interface and workflow are more complicated than PP 9.  I don't need a lot of that stuff, which adds clutter and complexity.
- I have experienced several non-critical (but nevertheless annoying) program crashes.
- It apparently just won't work with the TWAIN driver for my scanner - only the WIA driver.  Neither PP nor my scanner was able to shed any light on this - I just had to muddle through by experimentation.
- After installing PP 14, which comes with a bunch of auxiliary applications such as ""PDF Viewer Plus"" (which is made by DocuCom), I was unable to display most PDF files from Google Chrome - downloading important things like financial statements would result in an error box titled ""PDF Viewer Plus 7.1 - A file error has occurred.""  This was a serious problem for me, but I was finally able to solve it by a non-obvious Chrome fix:  Type ""chrome://plugins"" in the Chrome input line to bring up a list of plugins, find ""DocuCom PDF Plus"" and disable it.

I found 2012 a complete rethinking of the much older version that I had been using for a number of years. Now the 2014 is an update rather than an upgrade. If you have another version of Family Tree Maker on your computer installing this one means you have two versions on your computer.

I uninstalled 2014 from the netbook and installed it on a new laptop with Windows 8.1.  It went on easily with the program immediately updating itself and also downloading and installing at least twice in the last month.  You do need to install the program entirely to your computer. You cannot run it by putting the disc in the CD/DVD drive. Do make sure you have a substantial amount of memory available on your hard drive.

I can't tell a great deal of difference between the 2012 version and this version. However, there was a paper manual included, which is a miracle.  It's a handy size and easy to read and follow if you have some basic knowledge of the program.

We are finally realizing that our thoughts, emotions and physical body have an etheric counterpart that registers our bodily states. Attending to our spirits promotes peace, health, and a sense of well-being. The effect of stress and anxiety on our bodies is well documented. Likewise, studies are showing the powerful effects of prayer, meditation, and joy on our emotional and physical health.

Kurt Smith and Corwin Bell of The Wild Divine Project are two visionaries who have developed a groundbreaking tool that engages mind, body and spirit. The Journey To Wild Divine - The Passage is an ""Inner-active"" computer journey that integrates the power of the spiritual quest with an innovative biofeedback interface and high-end multi-media production. It incorporates mythology and elements of the classic hero and heroine's journey with state of the art 3D graphics, video and music.

In developing The Journey, Bell and Smith have collaborated with various leaders in the field of consciousness and compassionate action on both the spiritual and biofeedback technology aspects of the project. Known as ""allies,"" they include Jean Houston, a pioneer researcher in human capacities, and Nawang Khechog, a former Buddhist monk and one of Tibet's foremost world music composers and musicians.

Bio-feedback is the science of recording both Skin Conductance Levels (SCL) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and using this information to modify thoughts, emotions, and breathing. SCL is the measurement of sweat gland activity on a person's skin, and HRV is the calculation of the differences in heart rate from one heartbeat to the next. No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as ""Magic Rings"". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the ""Light Stone"" energy translator.

Up until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.

Set in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various ""Events"". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.

For example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as ""I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten"" or ""I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof."" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)

In one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.

However, not all ""Events"" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.

Helpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.

The Journey to the Wild Divine - The Passage comes in an attractive, sturdy box which includes:

*CD-Rom Software featuring spectacular high-definition 3-D graphics and video

*More than 40 unique energy and breathing ""Events""

*Install disks for both PC and Macintosh

*Easy-to-use ""Magic Ring"" biofeedback sensors

*""Light Stone"" energy translator

*Supports upcoming multi-user, online experiences

*Original Soul Flight music CD

*Companion Guide and User's Manual

The music that accompanies the game is filled with gorgeous orchestration from the Soul Flight CD, performed by The Wild Divine Band. Featuring Kurt Smith and Andy McEwen, the band's music (which is sold separately, as well) is intended to have Transformational Effects that can help facilitate the journey of the soul.

The Journey to Wild Divine is a groundbreaking tool for stress-relief, mindfulness, and meditation--promoting a sense of well-being and health. I highly recommend this visionary gift to humanity.

1) It reduces the amount of memory needed for the OS by about 7 GB. Thus, I have an additional 7-8 GB on my hard drive that I can use for pictures and music. This is important for me since I have thousands of photos from my trips, and while I back them up I also like to keep them on my actual hard drive so I can browse through them quickly. This is important too if you're like me and are still using and older laptop with less than 100GB of memory total.

2) Stacks and expose are a lot more useful and easier to use. You can use expose by holding the mouse on any application in the dock. Stacks allows you to go through multiple folders through the stacks window, not just opening the first folder you click. I hadn't used these features much in Leopard, but probably will now in Snow Leopard.

3) QuickTime X is a major upgrade from the free version of QuickTime installed in Leopard. The new version gives you a pretty decent editing capability for film and audio clips. This came at a perfect time for me as I have some movies from a recent trip but did not yet have a good editing program. Now I do.

4) Faster and smoother. I noticed the OS took faster to load up and applications are much faster. I no longer have to wait 5 minutes for Microsoft Word to open. For details on Snow Leopard's performance, check out some of the other reviews.

As advertised, it is quick and easy ... all except for the parts where you need to think about what you actually want, and that is your problem, not the software's.

It looks like it will work well for more complicated wills as well, but not having kids, ample assets, a business, or relatives I hate, I can't say for certain.

Willmaker Plus ships with Nolo Press's ""The Legal Answer Book for Families,"" which addresses legal issues in marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, adoption, children (in general), and elder care. I don't have issues in any of these areas (and hope not to), so I can't say how useful the book is. I will say that it is clearly written, and has what appear to be helpful tips and external links, but it's not a lawyer or a law encyclopedia and will not get you too far beyond the basics.

I have not yet tried the ""bonus"" subscription to Nolo's living trust, but will revise once I've had the opportunity.

Which brings me to a couple of negatives about this product. First, I registered it as instructed, but was then unable to login to retrieve the living trust. This is my fault, because I neglected to record the password. Fortunately, Nolo has the usual capability of resetting your password. Unfortunately, it doesn't work ... or isn't working at the moment. It sends me a reset link, but when I try to use it I'm told that it's expired. Annoying. [This was apparently a temporary glitch; I subsequently received a message with a working link.]

Second, when I ran through the process of installing Willmaker and creating a simple will (with plans to get a bit more baroque later, after I had spent the time to think through some issues), I was running on a PC that had recently upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10. I subsequently did a clean install of Win 10, and now I get a ""This App Can't Run on Your PC"" message. Clearly, it can run on my PC, but I need tech support to help me get it going.

I will revise this review once I've heard back from Quicken/Nolo on these issues and (I hope) given the living trust and its associated resources a try.

General comment on Nolo: There is nothing comparable to Nolo as a source of legal advice and guidance that is accessible to the general public. They have a well-earned reputation as a reliable source of legal information. On the other hand, their online materials are not all you could hope for. Their ""free legal updates"" tend to be very skimpy, and the related blogs (where they advertise them) tend to have a handful of old posts and nothing else.

General comment on Quicken: These guys are not exactly a model company. Customer support for Willmaker Plus 2016 will only last until the end of the year, assuming they give it the same treatment as Willmaker Plus 2015. By insisting that you must buy a new product every year, they are pushing customers away.

Bottom line: If you have a big and/or complicated estate, you should probably turn to your lawyer and your tax adviser instead of a piece of software. If your financial and legal affairs are relatively simple, however, Willmaker Plus could be a good choice for you. Customer support is not marvelous, however, and if you want to revise your will next year and you want it to reflect any relevant changes in the law, you will need to buy next year's version.","Mostly as advertised, but with some warts",1455062400,13,

The good:
Excel is still probably the best spreadsheet program out there.
Outlook is a good email program, if you don't use webmail.

The bad:
Powerpoint is crap and Keynote is significantly better.
Pages does everything I need out of a Word Processor. Really don't need Word except for opening other people's docs.

The ugly:
Microsoft has a tendency of rejiggering their UI and removing functionality for no apparent reason. This upgrade is no different. Mostly it's not a big deal, but there are some minor annoyances.

The lowdown:
If you already have Office 2011, I don't see the need to upgrade.

If you don't own Office... If you use spreadsheets a lot and, especially if other people are sending you Excel files, you're going to need Excel. Pages can usually open Word docs but it doesn't always keep the formatting, so it's nice to have Word. It's not a Must have, but it's useful just for that.

In the past, I've used Adobe Flash and Windows Movie Maker to make my trailers. Both have their pluses and minuses. Flash, for example, is expensive and comes with a high learning curve, whereas Windows Movie Maker is free (on the Windows OS), but extremely limiting.

Some authors (and publishers) create simple slide transitions with static imagery accompanied by background music. I, personally, find these types of trailers a bit dull, and not all that professional. The more ""movie-like"" a book trailer can be the better chance it has of gaining interest.

Like Flash, Anime Studio uses both a timeline and layers, which gives you the ability to create detailed motions: such as a character walking with clouds floating in the background. The bone structure in AS (Anime Studio) allows for easy character movements, such as lifting an arm and bending an elbow at the same time. This actually works easier than it does in Flash. I also like how there is a library of pre-made body parts, such as eyes (with different expressions) and mouths that animate automatically based on the words spoken in your audio (you can also change the pitch of your voice to sound more cartoon'ish-which you can record directly in the program). This is a major time saver. There are also wizards that help you to create your own custom characters without much effort (though I wish there was an easy way to create backgrounds too). Another great feature is that you can directly (from AS) upload your animations to Facebook and YouTube.

That said, as an Adobe designer (for over ten years), I found the tools and shortcuts in Anime Studio different enough to make simple tasks somewhat difficult. My thought was to design my vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator, and then import them into AS. This isn't possible in Anime Studio Debut, but it is in the Pro version, which provides the ability to use Adobe for some things and AS for others.

If you are considering the Debut version instead of Pro, consider these limitations: a 2 minute animation maximum, limit of 3000 frames, no more than 2 audio tracks, only 1 video track, no 3D support, a 788 x 768 maximum export size, among a plethora of other limitations and missing features. I strongly suggest visiting the SmithMicro website and viewing their comparison chart if you are considering the Debut version over the Pro.

File types you can import:
Images: JPEG, BMP, PSD, PNG, TGA
Audio: WAV, AIFF, MP3, M4A
Video: MOV, AVI, and MPEG-4

File types you can export:

I mean, as an American, I've of course encountered words like ""grande"" and ""hombre,"" but I've had almost no Spanish instruction in my life. (I did have a semester of Spanish in sixth grade, but I am 99.9 percent sure the instructor didn't actually speak Spanish, and I certainly didn't learn anything. Plus, that was two decades ago.)

I'm still working on Level 1 of this program, because I'm the mom of a very busy toddler and I also don't want to go so fast that none of what I'm learning ""sticks."" But so far, I am absolutely in love with the Rosetta Stone program.

The software (which I run on a Macbook, with absolutely no problems) is very intuitive and easy to use. There's almost no English -- just pictures and Spanish words, phrases and sentences that you quickly come to associate with one another. For example, the software says, ""Es rojo"" and you select the picture of the red object, as opposed to the blue or green or yellow one. It's almost like being in Latin America and having a very patient Spanish-speaking friend point out everything you see, again and again and again, until you learn to associate the word and the concept or object.

This method works surprisingly well for verbs and other grammatical constructions, I've found. I was really amazed at how quickly I picked up things like subject/verb agreement just from the photos and from repetition.

There is definitely a lot of repetition. Some people may find this frustrating, especially if they pick up on something very quickly and then remember it well, but it's worked well for me. I tend to grasp a concept very fast and then forget it almost immediately. But working through this program slowly seems to really be pounding Spanish into my head.

The audio companions, while probably not strictly necessary, are nice. I listen to them while I'm driving.

It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.  I highly recommend the product.

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version.  It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document.  Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!
One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.
As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

Fuchs,"I started with Trend Micro when it was still the horribly named PC-cillin and have upgraded it three times (note that I paid for the product the first two times and the last two times received comped review copies).  In between times two and three, my employer required me to install Norton on my computer in order to interface it with the company dial in.  While the Norton was slightly faster than both my version of Trend Micro that came before it and the one that came after, Norton was never as good in my opinion.  Trend Micro found more viruses and spyware and had an easier user interface.  It's one problem was that it was always very slow.

I am happy to report that this version seems to do just as good a job identifying viruses and spyware as previous versions of Trend Micro, but it loads and runs much more quickly.  I also like the feature that Trend has added to the last few versions of this software which is to identify on web search result pages whether or not the sites that come up are safe -- the software shows safe search results in green, questionable sites with a question mark, and unsafe sites with a red ""X"".  We have an older version of Trend Micro at work that doesn't have this feature, so I feel much safer surfing the net at home.

Since this is an upgrade for me rather than a completely new installation, I can't speak to how easy it is to install and configure these days.  It was a little bit hard to configure the software back when I first got the program some six years ago, but once I got it up and running the way I wanted, I've never had to do much of anything to change it and I suspect they've improved the initial set-up as so many other things in the program have improved over the years.

Other people can probably give you a more geek-specific review, but in the six years in which I've been running Trend Micro on my computers in one version or another, I've never had a virus that made it onto my system or that Trend Micro has missed and any other scan has caught (and I periodically run a scan with other software just to be safe).  When I replaced Norton with my third version of Trend Micro, it caught some nasty spyware that Norton had missed.

Office 2003 gives you what you already have in Office XP (and a few earlier versions) so learning how to use it is never going to be a problem.  In virtually every way the program looks and feels like the previous Office versions.

There are improvements although I am not sure how much a home user will need the XML functionality.  It may be a god-send one day but today it is still not a major factor and certainly does not demand a major update.  The RESEARCH option is something to contend with and could be quite useful - it is almost like having Encarta loaded on your machine as well.  I found it a bit limiting though; it is good as a thesaurus but there is no world atlas, quotation source, etc.  Many people have applauded the new look and feel of Outlook.  Again, it behaves just the same as previous versions of Outlook did.

Microsoft chose to retire the Office bar and that is a big mistake.  They are trying to push the Quick Launch bar but most businesses and almost all Office users preferred the Office bar.

Don't get me wrong:  Office 2003 works very well and with Word, Outlook, Excel, Access and Publisher you can literally do anything!  It also preforms very well.  But, again, unless Microsoft starts making major changes, these releases should not be heralded as new.

Tresca,"I was new to Vista when I received my new laptop, so I wasn't aware of the changing software landscape that seems to be a hallmark of Microsoft products.  Although I did get the Microsoft Office Suite, it now excludes Outlook.  This made me very, very angry.

When the opportunity to review this latest incarnation of Outlook came along, I jumped at it, because life post-Outlook is pretty awful. And, now that I'm back in the warm bosom of Microsoft's email program, I can breathe a sigh of relief.

This is the same Outlook you either love or hate.  The programs still seem to be developed independently of each other. There's also junk email scanning which is semi-useful if you don't have spam blocking on your server side. The Reading Pane is omnipresent but removable and there's this irritating tendency to group messages into, well, groups, as if the entire world thought that would be a good idea for message sorting.  News flash: It isn't. Fortunately, it can be turned off.

The calendar is the same as other Outlook calendars, only a little more graphically appealing.  You still cannot easily import data from one of the Outlook programs to the other; dragging and dropping emails preserves body and header.  Similarly, you can drag an email to your contacts, but that only drops the email name into the contacts list and dumps the entire body into Notes field.  In other words, there's no smart way to navigate content between the various sub-programs within Outlook.  This is something that's sorely needed.  The electronic signature at the bottom of emails is becoming the de facto business card, and it'd be nice if we could just import that content right into Contacts.  But alas, Outlook's not about to be THAT innovative.

The other new thing that hangs around, waiting for you to notice it, is the To-Do Bar.  As if navigating the myriad of Outlook programs who don't really like each other wasn't difficult enough, you are now expected to navigate sideways.  From a space perspective, this makes sense; there's more real estate on the horizontal axis of most monitors.  But it is counterintuitive to the rest of the Outlook design, which is top to bottom. The To-Do Bar is basically what used to happen when you clicked on your name in older versions of Outlook: it summarizes all your relevant information in one place. The problem is that it won't go away easily. It eventually goes away if you can figure out how to ask it nicely.  But apparently each application is treated like its own entity, so removing the To-Do Bar from say, email, means it still shows up when you're in Tasks.

Finally there's what's new in this version of Outlook, the Business Contact Manager.  It requires SQL server. This is most useful if you're running a business, and contains everything from projects to accounts, billable hours to marketing campaigns.  It's of particular use to freelancers and hourly consultants; as a consultant myself once, I ended up using the journal to clock my progress, but the BCM can do it better.  Being the new kid on the block, BCM is better integrated with all the other programs.

At times, Outlook's various programs seem like squabbling in-laws at a wedding...related and not happy about it.

7717,7717,4.0,False,"03 23, 2014",A23NSKTMSPPBTR,B00E6LJBUO,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},Wayne,"Although I've been using Quicken to track my expenses going back over 25 years, I never got around to installing the last several versions before this one. So I have to compare how much of an improvement there has been compared to the years before that. New versions (actually new releases, using the industry parlance that was in place when Quicken for DOS first hit the market) are iterative, add some new features, but are largely the same as older versions with only one or two significantly new or improved features. If you put this in a historical context, that's actually a good thing. When Scott Cook first came up with Quicken, he didn't take the traditional approach. He advertised in airline magazines rather than computer magazines and advertised to ""regular people"" rather than computer people. Instead of selling for the inflation-adjusted price of $854, which was common for spreadsheets, databases and word processors of the day, he sold the software for well under $100, inflation adjusted. And he sold annual updates for a price low enough that it was literally cheaper than buying an aftermarket book on how to use the product. They weren't major changes, but they were affordable. So when you pay a mere $39.99 for the entire product, depending on the version, you are benefiting from a revolution that Scott Cook single-handedly put in place to change the entire software industry.

In that sense, you get a lot for your money. When I first started using Quicken, it was an easy way to keep my checkbook balanced, and allowed me to print checks directly from a dot matrix printer. Over time, support was added for credit cards, investments, real property, and even business functions depending on the version. The software lets you look at the big picture when it comes to your finances. It lets you link accounts in such a way that you can see what comes out of one account when it goes into another account, or what goes from your cash account to your investment account or from your checking account to pay your credit card bills. It lets you keep track of your receipts and keep images of your checks or invoices with the individual transactions. And it keeps track of your securities, monitors the prices, and shows you how well your investments perform. It does so a lot better than tools you might find at your brokerage since there are so many ways of reporting things.

The latest version has cloud support and support for an app for your phone. Yes, it's limited to spending accounts and you will still have to use an app from your broker to get an instant view of your investments. Then again, you would need to do so to execute trades anyway. But for spending, it's a lot easier to snap a photo of a receipt with a smartphone than to scan it or enter it later, so when it syncs with the desktop app, it's easier to match things up with downloaded transactions.

It's come a long way from its origins, and although I no longer need it for printing out the checks to pay my monthly bills, I can use it to track more complex financial concerns such as stocks, bonds, options trading, ESPP shares, employee stock options, the value of my home, my mortgage payments with an ongoing view of principal and interest, and even paychecks with the amount split to account for federal, state, and local taxes, FICA, medicare and deductions for 401(k)s (which end up in the appropriate account register automatically) or healthcare spending or ESPPs. It lets you keep track of spending by categories, and allows for tags (formerly classes) so you can track things in multiple directions. If you want to get a report on spending by category or figure out how much you spent on education or dining, it's easy. And if you tag things so that you know which expenses were for your 2006 Hawaii trip, you can know how much you spent in total or break it down by airfare, lodging, meals or souvenirs. You can even use foreign currency and account for exchange rates.  You can use as little or as many of these features as you want. You can establish budgets and see how well you've been doing for years or decades, depending on how long you've been using the product.

The product isn't perfect and still has a few bugs in it that affect usability but not the underlying financial integrity of your data. And some tasks are easier than others. Some of the wizards work from some places and not others. And some areas are not optimized for the type of security. For example, options trading is a thinly disguised version of stock trading, won't let you use standard actions such as ""sell to open"", ""buy to close"" or expire contracts based on the date in the symbol and the price of the underlying security. You might need to use less obvious terms such as buying to cover at zero cost in order to close out expired contracts. And you need to view things as shares instead of contracts. Plus there's no price history for options. And there's no support for RSUs, despite the fact that the people in charge of Quicken have been granted RSUs, and thus can't use the product to track their own finances in a comprehensive way.

Despite the limitations, the product still covers the most common needs of most users. I'd like to see more emphasis on adding support for new features such as the ones I've mentioned, especially given that they aren't major programming tasks. I think the product has gotten so comprehensive that they are running out of ideas as to what to add for new releases.

The product also comes with three years of data service at no extra charge, after which you will most likely want to get a newer version. I think they would have had fewer detractors had they marketed the data service as a separate entity and let you know they are bundling it for free. The product itself does not expire, as many people think, but becomes a lot less useful once the data service expires and you can no longer download from your financial institutions. It's simply too expensive for the company to offer that kind of support for a longer period than what they cover, and it's cheap enough that even if you don't upgrade annually, it's worth getting a new version at least every two years.

It is undeniable that Trend Micro catches some flak from industry critics, which concerned me at first. I utilized Trend Micro in '10, saw some of the reviews for the company, and subsequently tried a few of the critically acclaimed heavy hitters for my PC protection in 2011. The fact is, almost every other program I tried annihilated my computer's performance in comparison to Trend's light load. What's more, because of the rather typical use of my machine, Trend seems to do just as good of a job protecting my PC as the big gun programs that bring it to a grinding halt.

Choices are clear and you can change your selections later if you decide. You also get the opportunity to decide between simple and advanced interfaces. The advanced interface offers more configuration options which will likely be needed later if you plan to utilize the full features.  Updating took a little while when I installed from disk. It also required several reboots.  You can save initial setup time by downloading the latest version from Bitdefender's web site and using the key provided with purchased copy. The program offered the option to scan for viruses after install.  Scanning was pretty quick.  Deep scan took 1/2 hour,quick scan took 7 1/2 minutes. Detailed log files are created of the results. System impact seems minimal with real-time scanning enabled.  There is also a laptop/gaming mode that will further reduce background processes and resource consumption when gaming or on a laptop. The firewall seemed a little paranoid initially as I received pop-up firewall warnings the first time I started my web browser and any web dependent programs.  I had to grant access for a component of IE and Maplestory, however Unreal Tournament and iTunes were automatically configured.  Casual users might be intimidated by some of the initial warnings, especially if they have to choose whether or not to grant access.  However, a glance at the warning box can usually determine if the program is legitimate or not. I also received pop-up warnings when attempting to install a program from CD-ROM.  There is no easy way to temporarily disable real-time protection for software installations or other tasks that the AV might interfere with.  There's no right-click option to pause or disable from the taskbar icon.  Even after opening the program and manually disabling all protection options, the program still appeared to be running in the background.  Parental controls were not very reliable initially.  Despite selecting the Teenager setting during setup, I was still able to access inappropriate sites.  After fiddling with the settings, I discovered I had to set it to Heuristic mode to automatically block inappropriate sites. Once I did this, inappropriate sites were blocked, however, I was also unable to reach some safe sites that had advertising.  I added a site to the white list, however it continued to block links within the site.  I eventually disabled the Heuristic mode out of frustration.  I felt it was too much of an all or nothing approach.  The phishing filter seems on par with most of the others out there.

Overall, although I feel the predefined rules for the firewall and parental controls could be better, the program is otherwise solid and offers extensive options to fine-tune protection.  They may want to tweak the parental control in future updates as I honestly doubt a user would be patient enough to manually add sites and the links within to the white list on a frequent basis.",Good performance with a few quirks,1225843200,,

Norton was really the only game in town when it came to anti-virus protection.  Then came along McAfee and we had some competition.  Now there are a multitude of options out there and I have had some experience with just about all of themand to be honest I still think Norton is the best.

Reasons for that: I feel Norton still spends the most resources on updating and fighting new threats compared to others.  I have interacted with them before on a particular virus problem and they were very good and very professional.  And I believe they take very seriously all the threats that are out in the world.

360 is Nortons kind of all in one product, meaning it focuses on everything from viruses in downloads, scams in email, outside intrusions into your personal network.  The software really does try to offer a 360 degree protection for your machine.

This is a one user, three license product, meaning it is intended for one person to use on perhaps three different machines.  You basically sign up for your Norton account and you can now download the software on to three separate machines.  One desktop, two laptops; or two desktops and one laptop, you get the picture.  You can move the licenses if you need to but it is a bit of a hassle.  As uninstalling Norton is never easy.

The two biggest negative things I have to say about Norton is that, one, it is a resource hog.  You really need a somewhat up to date computer.  Anything too old or two slow and this software can cause things to come to a crawl on your computer.  You won't have any viruses, but your computer will run pretty darn slow.

The other thing I don't like is the control scheme, Norton can be really easy to use, if you let Norton do what it wants, but if you are a power user, and you like to change a lot of settings and really control what Norton does and when it does it, it is harder rather than easy.  I wish Norton would have two different interfaces.  One for regular users, and perhaps one for power users that allows easy changing or settings.

However, our experience with the teaching aspect of this program has been less than stellar.

My six year old granddaughter adapted to the program very easily as, like many children her age, she's very familiar with laptops, leapfrog, phones and such. But it became evident almost from the start that her reading level was somewhat above what this program is capable of and she quickly became bored with it, especially the repetitious method used in teaching.

If your laptop is running Intel Drivers in windows 7 or Vista, they are not compatible with 8. When you pay the $39.00 upgrade fee, you get your key emailed to you.

I chose use the internet on the first try and the problems started. During the install, 8 came up and said the Intel Driver must be uninstalled. I chose OK. When that happened, a window came up and said the computer must be restarted.  When my HP restarted, it booted to a blue screen, and went into system recovery in windows 7 and restored windows 7. Then I could not get back into the Windows 8 download site until I found and deleted the panther file from the attempted install. That took an hour or so. Once I did that, I got back into the download site.  I then chose option 2,and burned the media to a DVD. Then I shut down and restarted and entered my C MOS and made sure I set the boot sector to boot from the DVD Rom first and the hard drive second and usb third. If you don't do this, you will never get 8 installed. Once 8 uninstalled the Intel drivers, it booted back to the DVD, the install worked fine.

It's a real good bet that ""earlier"" Microsoft products will go end of life well before this does. It's also a good bet that as newer hardware comes out, you *will* need Win 10 to support it. All of the machines I have upgraded to Win 10 from 7 and 8.1 have done fine. I had one video driver on one of the 6 machines that needed to be updated (10 minute fix). That's pretty amazing for a Microsoft OS upgrade.

Right now, you have a couple of choices here on Amazon. You can grab this USB flash version of Win 10 and directly install it. No fuss, no problems it's a pretty easy thing to install. It's a great thing for a tablet or laptop that has no DVD drive. There are two other choices. You can buy either Win 8.1 or Win 7 OEM disks and do the free upgrade. In both cases make sure you get the ""with SP1"" versions to reduce the hassles. You will need to do a *lot* of upgrades from Microsoft Update with either one. I've done both, the Win 7 process *seems* easier.

So what does this one do for you? It saves 1 or 2 days of poking at the computer every so often to tell it to do updates again. Could you do them faster than that? Sure, but you would need to sit at the machine for hours. If you are on a slow internet connection, it could take longer. If you are on Google Fiber at 1 Gb/s, can I come live at your house? All approaches get you a fully working Win 10 machine. Check the current prices (they change quickly). Right now you can save some real money going the Win 7 or 8.1 route.

First off, it installs easily enough, and quickly, on Win 7.  Installation was no problem.
I was then presented with an options menu.  I really didn't quite understand enough ABOUT the program to really set any options, so I thought I'd just start the program.
I was forced to watch a movie on posture and fingering.  I suppose if I'd known better I could have turned it off in options, but I'm not the type to study a program before I use it.  I just want it to work- intuitively would be nice.
I'm impatient, and felt like I lost time out of my life I'd never get back suffering through those movies that are slow, plus Mavis just talks so slow.  Only beginning typists might need this.  I'm already a proficient typist, but I'd love to type 110wpm.
The skills assessment test was easy enough, though it took off points for an old timer like me that double spaced between sentences.  Still I did well enough to move up to level 3.
The problem was the lessons tried to start me at level ONE.  I had missed that I had to manually set my lessons up to start in options.  It would be really nice if the program had done this FOR me.  It is software and software is all about automation first, rich media second in my mind.
I couldn't find the options menu.  It's not on the main screen that you use most.  I clicked everything, I stopped and restarted the program- how ANNOYING.  Of course that's when I realized it was labeled as PREFERENCES under a screen that comes up when you first start the software.  It's worth time to spend a lot of time in PREFERENCES if you are somewhat proficient and simply want to increase your speed.
It still took me to lesson 1, home row.
Is it too much to ask that I be able to choose the lessons that I want to do?  I got pretty fed up with it in the 4 times I sat down to try to use it.  I have a cheap Sponge Bob typing program I liked better than this one.  This is just boring, and it's not at all intuitive and it wants to control everything I do while using it.

My son is a very self-directed learner too, and I don't think this would work for him either.  I'll keep looking.

I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years but now I am done with them.  Unlike many reviewers that post in December or January I don't review software that I haven't used.  I used this software and in the end I wish that I had purchased something else.  My review is based on actual experience and not just a review to garner votes by posting early.

I had numerous problems and it took me twice as long to do my taxes as it should have.  It kept asking the same questions over and over and I filled out the boxes and when that section was completed none of the dollar figures or answered questions showed up as correct.  The most glaring was when it asked me if I had prepaid estimated taxes and I answered yes.  It then asked me what amounts and I filled in the quarterly payments.  When done it did not include those payments in the refund calculation and I had to manually override the data and fix it.  This one mistake alone would have cost me $1200. If I had not been watching the refund amount at the top of the screen I might have missed this error.

I used the walk me through format as I normally do and this year it was just garbage.  It would ask me if a set of circumstances would apply to my return and I would answer no and then it would proceed to ask me 20 to 30 questions to which I have already answered that they did not apply.  When I answered yes to a section and answered every question and filled in numbers, when appropriate, it would not use the data or the numbers and I had to go back and fill out the data and numbers again.  Very time consuming and frustrating.

Ultimately I had no trust in the way this software worked and I rechecked every number and calculation before I filed.  Like I said before, one error alone would have cost me $1200.  When I was completed it did a scan and it found a mistake, or so it claimed.  It told me a number for my 2013 taxes was not entered correctly and I checked it and it was correct.  I even looked at the actual printout of my 2013 taxes to verify the number.  To make matters worse it truncated the code for the local tax authorities for the county that I live in making it almost impossible to determine what it was even questioning.  It stated the taxes paid to INC were wrong when the code is IN C-41.  I had to manually go back to the forms and fix the error that really was not a problem and it had no bearing on my 2014 return.  A simple waste of time for what it called a data collection form.

Doing taxes is not really fun and wasting twice as much time as required makes it really a hassle.  Turbo tax has lost a customer that has been loyal for over 20 year back to the days of Turbo Tax coming to you on floppy disks.

My last version of this software was version X3, and I certainly did find this version to be quite a bit faster, and the user interface to be quite a bit better. This latest version boasts several performance improvements over previous versions, and it also has an even longer list of editing tools. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is an efficient and comprehensive video editing program that has more than enough features and video editing capabilities for the average user.

One reason I got this new version is because it allows me to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. But the main reason I got this new version is for the 64-bit high-end Special FX Pack, the really great slideshow maker, and the much faster video rendering. This software is designed to take advantage of more computing power if your computer has it available. My computer does in fact have quite a bit of muscle, and I did find this version of this software to be faster. It's certainly not ""WOW"" faster, but quite noticeably faster. However, if your computer is lacking in the muscle department, you likely won't notice much of a difference in rendering speeds, so do take that into account.

Something else I wanted to mention is that I own several other video editing programs, and while their specs are the same as Corel's, for some reason Corel's rendered output just plain looks better. I don't know why, but it does. And not just a little bit better either. It's significantly better. After you finish your project, what you see onscreen is significantly clearer and smoother. This, of course, isn't a minor thing, this is a major thing, and this tells me that Corel's software is definitely doing something differently, something much better than what their competitor's software is doing. So, while there are other video editing programs that certainly have more bells and whistles than Corel's, if the quality of the finished product is the most important thing to you, do take Corel's top quality output into account.

Now, like I said, my last version of the software was version X3, and while all the improvements to this latest version are really terrific, what makes this newest version a real winner is the fact that it's still very affordable.

I've been using the 2011 version and I don't see a lot of changes, but I do find that integrating data from the searches is going much smoother.  I like that this comes with six months of access to their database.  What I find is that every few years I like to do some research and update my family tree.

Then I buy a new version with 3-6 months of Ancestry.com access and then do some more updating.

If that's your plan, decide how much time you want to spend.  If you are just getting started the six month subscription is nice, though three months is a good chunk of time.  The book that comes with this would be helpful for a beginner.  It might even help me if I read it, but that's not going to happen.

Now if you are a serious researcher and expect to keep the online subscription going for years, there isn't a lot of savings to be had by buying this, but you do save a few dollars over the web price.  If you buy an older version the price will go down a lot and then it can be a bargain.  In fact for years I would just buy ""last year's"" software because I could get web access for 3-6 months for about $20.

Note that for access to their overseas database you will pay more ($150 for six months) and for their most all encompassing subscription (which includes very extensive newspaper databases) you will be $200 for six months.

I have to tell you, all the professional reviews I read were very high on Office 2016 for Mac, but all the user reviews on Amazon and elsewhere painted a completely different picture. I went into my evaluation of Office Home and Business 2016 for Mac with huge reservations, but after about a week, I'm beginning to think that Microsoft may have resolved many of the issues that that existed at launch.

I'm using an old MacBook Air (mid 2012) with just 4GB of RAM and the Office installation did not suddenly bog my system down, nor have I had problems actually running Office. Every piece of the suite--Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook--runs smoothly on my Mac. And they look so much better than Office 2011. One bummer I didn't know about in advance was that Outlook 2016 for Mac only supports Exchange Server 2012 and above and my company hasn't yet upgraded to the newer Exchange server. I'm not sure why this limitation exists for the Mac, because the Windows version works fine with the older Exchange server.

I also want to mention that I researched the licensing and from what I've read, you can install this version more than once, but it can only be running on one computer at a time. If you happen to get a new computer or you reinstall the OS, you're allowed to install it again. The caveat is that you must uninstall it from everywhere else and you can only do this once every 90 days. Also keep in mind that this version does not allow you to install Office on your iPad or iPhone.

If you don't want to pay hundreds more for an Adobe Creative Suite or you don't need to share files with other professional digital graphic or video artists, then CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 is the way to go.

Since the early days of computer software, Adobe and CorelDRAW ran neck and neck for the top graphic design and image editing programs.  Since the turn of the millenium, Adobe edged forward and has since sat atop all design, photo, and video software programs.  With more acceptance and praise also came a higher price tag.... much higher.... 3-5x times higher.

For all of us coveting an Adobe Creative Suite, there is an alternative that works just as well and has many faithful devotees - it's CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5.  In CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 you can do nearly everything that Adobe CS can do and in most cases just as well or better.  The capabilities of both software programs are nearly identical - the important difference being the restricted access to file types.  Adobe's video and graphic file types have become the professional design industry standard over the years.  This is the biggest thorn in the side for CorelDRAW users. To avoid downtime and technical setbacks, it is vital that designers sharing files use the same software and version.  Since Abode is the industry standard, a CorelDRAW user will be the odd man out, even though his software is not inferior.

So if you want the most capable software, but don't want invest a year of car payments on a computer program, then CorelDRAW is the way to go.","If you don't want or can't afford an Adobe Suite, get this!",1300320000,,

And, like other video rendering software, it is slow and clunky. It has, however, solved a problem for me that makes it worth using.

I recently tried to sync videos to my iPhone and found that many videos that played fine on my iPod would not transfer to the iPhone. These included a couple of movies I had transferred using Handbrake Lite and several QuickTime videos I had downloaded as part of an online course. The QT videos had been converted to iPod format using iTunes.

After doing some research online, I found this was a common problem because of slight variations in the encoding for iPod and iPhone video. Although some videos will play on both, others (including some converted through iTunes) will not.

The files converted by Crunch in standard iPhone format play in iTunes, and sync with both the iPod and the iPhone. I was able to successfully convert files that had previously played only in iTunes and on the iPod, and get them to work on the iPhone, too.

I tried this software on both a Windows XP PC and a Mac. Both worked well. The Mac interface is a bit cleaner and might be considered easier to use, although both are simple. The main advantage the PC version has is that in addition to a bar showing the progress of the file conversion, the percentage complete is displayed. It makes it easy to estimate the time remaining in the conversion.

So this is not the software you want to back up your collection of DVD movies. (Try Handbrake for that if you are on a Mac.)

Sometimes it would crash for no apparent reason, other times the accuracy didn't seem that great.  It also was quite a resource hog, but then again so is version 10.  However I have a pretty good computer with a quad four processor, and three gigs of RAM so it doesn't really pose a problem.  Generally when I'm not using it I shut it off anyway.

I have noticed however that the accuracy and stability is a lot better than version 9. A lot of the quirkiness maybe due to the complexity of the program.  It is a full-featured program albeit with a user-friendly interface. As time goes by I will try tweaking the program a little more.

I cannot comment on the included headset that comes with the software. I am still using my trusty Telex USB headset. I've had this thing for years and it works great so why change.

In conclusion all I can say is I'm happy with the software.  It is very functional, a step up from version 9, and a lifesaver for those that are typing challenged. It does require some effort on the users part, but then again so do most things that are worthwhile.  I would definitely have given it a five star rating if not due to the quirkiness.

I like what I see from Office 2010. It matches the interface of the Windows Live applications, WordPad, and Paint; which the color scheme chosen for 2007 prevented it from doing. I hope to eventually upgtade my everyday school laptop to one with a new-fangled processor, and the 3-install disc will come in very handy.

I got the last copy of this software available at my local Wal-Mart, and it has proven that you don't have to have the highest-end Office suite to be able to get productive work done, whether for school assignmnents or personal use.

I know Office 2003 is better, but my school has long since switched to 2007 and now 2010, so I had to get with it, and not keep using something so outdated on PCs that I hope to earn my college degree with.

Here are the specs for the system I am using it on (DIY system)
Intel Core i5-3570K CPU
Intel 180GB SSD
HIS 512MB HD5670 GPU
8GB DDR3-1600 RAM (2 x 4GB)
Lite-On IHBS112 blu-ray burner

The first thing that attracted me to this package was the claim of WMC TV file support. I've used the very excellent VideoRedo in the past but it's twice as much as this whole package. I knew this didn't have automatic commercial detection but if I could at least trim the beginning and end and convert the files to MKVs, I'd be happy. So, the first thing I tried was to load a WTV file and I was able to do that, even a big 11GB file. It took a while to get used to the video editor but I was able to trim the beginning and end of a video. Converting it to MKV however was a different story. While the Video app supports WTV, for some reason the Recode app does not. I was able to get it to load a DVR-MS file (the old kind). Like MKV, DVR-MS is just a container. In this case the stream is MPEG2. I wanted to write out a MKV with MPEG2 so I would not have to convert it but for some reason the option to change the stream from H.264 to MPEG2 is grayed out so it required conversion to change the container.

The next thing I tried was the Blu-ray player. The whole package is half the price of most commercial software blu-ray players so if this worked, it's worth it alone even if nothing else does. I was able to watch a Blu-ray the first time but the second time when I went to play the Blu-ray the move just hung. I had to reboot to get it to work again.

That's about as far as I've gotten. There are three other things I'll want to do at some point I used to always do with Roxio Creator that'll come up as needed:

Crop an MP3 file for using as a ringtone
Burn a DVD with menus
and the new one I want to try is burning videos to a Blu-ray.

I won't be using all the library and organization tools (Nero MediaHome) since I already use Windows Media Center and MediaBrowser 3 for those (if you haven't checked out MediaBrowser3 it's amazing).

So far, I am pretty happy with it. We'll see how it goes with a big movie project. I have quite the backlog of home movies but it's so hard to find the time to edit them and put them onto a disc. New ringtones will probably be first since that's quick. I don't expect any issues there since MP3s are so lightweight.

[Update]
The Blu-ray support in this package is really a hidden gem. Given the price compared to WinDVD, TMT, etc. I wouldn't hesitate to get this if you want a software Blu-ray player. Even recent titles like Gravity and Enders Game worked.

After quite a bit of searching through each of the Nero modules, I was surprised to find the package actually does not include any sound editing tools. It turns out there's a free download from the Nero website for Nero WaveEditor. So, if you're looking for something to edit MP3s, this package doesn't have it. I am surprised.",Pretty good except for when it crashes or hangs. Blu-ray support is worth it alone.,1395273600,,

The first release of Vista probably deserved some of the criticism, but so did those who tried to install it on older machines that just weren't up to the task. Microsoft probably set expectations a little too high, and as what happened with the first Star Wars prequel, the end product was never going to live up to the expectations.

I did not have any experience with Vista until after the release of SP1, so I might have been spared some ugliness that came out of the gates. Since this review is for the SP1 version, I can safely say that you won't experience the pain and agony that was felt by some of those early adopters, IF you install it on decent hardware.

Don't install a current operating system on hardware that was made years before the release of the operating system. Don't install an OS like Vista on a machine that is choked for RAM or hard drive space.

The box says that it recommends a 1 GHz or faster processor, but I wouldn't install it on anything slower than a 3 GHz Pentium 4. It also says that 1GB of RAM is fine. I would say that's a minimum, and anyone doing multiple tasks should be looking at 2GB as a minimum. (You'll need to get the 64-bit version to use anything past 3GB)

Lastly, don't install this OS on a system drive that has meager transfer rates. Something with a minimum average of 50MB/s will probably do just fine, but the faster the better, of course.

You can't buy a Porsche, put no name tires on it, and fill it with 85 octane gas, and expect decent performance. Likewise, don't install a newer operating system on hardware that is years behind the OS in technology. XP is a great OS for older machines. It will run on a P3-450 with a half GB of RAM without any trouble (so long as you're not installing the latest and greatest software that expects more recent hardware).

The bottom line is to use the right tool for the job. Vista SP1 on a decent machine that was new at the time Vista was released is not going to present issues.

I have used Nero ever since as I watched it get bloated with more and more ""features"" that had little or nothing to do with CD/DVD burning.  Nero is truly several separate applications rather than a suite, and the CD/DVD burning portion is capable but very dated.  My new computer came pre-loaded with Roxio Creator 9 so I have been using it for several months and had no problems with it.  I liked some of the new features of Creator 10 when it was introduced but was completely scared away by all of the negative, and even hostile, reviews.  Recently I was able to buy it for 39 after rebates and figured I couldn't go wrong for the price.  After using it for a while here are my first impressions:

The variety and usefulness of the included applications is amazing.  Even at full price I think it is one of the best software bargains in the world.  I have tried each of the apps, though not in depth, at this point and they each work.  My favorite is the audio capture function.  Unlike everything else out there that requires several steps to capture audio, Creator 10 installs a widget on your screen in which you simple press a red ""record"" button to capture a clip.  After the capture is completed you are taken to a very easy to use audio editing screen where you can trim and equalize your clip before saving it to a variety of popular formats.  This application alone is worth the price of the entire bundle.
Also included are a competent backup program, nice media player (but come on, who needs another media player with Microsoft, Apple and Real dominating the market?), label creator, media manager (a cool app that catalogs all those unlabeled CD/SVD disks you have laying around), apps to easily create music and video compilations, a nice photo editing app plus a panorama photo stitcher, a pretty capable video editing program (although I'm puzzled why it can't read FLV files), a cassette/LP converter tool, and about 10 more highly useful tools.

Negatives?  Well first of all I will semi-dispute what several reviewers have said about it freezing their system on installation.  I thought so too, and then realized that a full install was loading over 50,000 files into my computer and even though I have a very powerful computer, the process took almost 45 minutes, making it the longest load time for any software I've ever owned.  Where Roxio messed up is that the install screen only has a simple message that ""installation may take several minutes"".  There are long periods ... like a couple of minutes at a time ... where the status bar does nothing and you would swear your computer is frozen.  You just have to have a lot of patience and resist the urge to terminate the install, which may be why some people have had so much trouble with the software.  Roxio could save a lot of frustration by making the install process a little more clear.
My other concern is that my anti-virus and anti-spyware programs (from two different companies) both identified Creator 10 as mal-ware.  I would like to know more about what information Roxio is gathering from my computer and how they are using it.  Software companies should be more open with their customers about such things.

Bottom line is that I don't think Creator 10 is as bad as some people make it out to be.  Today's computers are incredibly complex and there seems to be a tendency to blame hardware or software for lack of understanding of how computers work.  Other than your operating system, Creator 10 is probably one of the most complicated things you can install on your computer and there is no doubt it will have a noticeable effect on performance.  If you choose to go with Creator 10 make sure you have a very capable system with plenty of hard drive space and as much memory as you can afford.

I ran into a couple of software compatitabilty issues.

Since I have 2 hard drives, I kept XP on the other drive in case I have to play old games.

I knew that Vista wasn't that much better than XP function wise but it did offer a different look with the Aero feature which meant I had to upgrade to higher end video card but it was worth it.

I was very disappointed when I discovered that the defrag program didn't provide choice in what drive to defrag(I have 8 partitions) or any kind of status bar to view to actually see if the program is running.

Get a third party defrag program.

Setting up my network was a little tricky since the default workgroup name was changed to Workgroup from MSHOME in XP and I wasn't aware of that.

I couldn't setup a new printer on my network XP laptop since it couldn't use the printer driver from my Vista computer. After going to the Vista Community forum, I discovered how to setup a new printer port on both computers.

I've been using Pinnacle Studio as far back as I can remember, through their multiple ownership changes.  I've never gotten too deep into the magic it can do, I was just doing things like making DVD's and such of home movies of my kid or other family things.

So I've dealt with creating the various DVD menus, scene transitions and wipes, adding titles, trimming scenes and repositioning them.  Nothing intense, but all I really needed to do.  So I know I'm just a tyro when it comes to the program, and I only barely scratch the surface.

But I like how, as each version is released, some things are added that are simply more intuitive.  For example, having imported a movie (I've tested with MKV, MPG, and MP4 so far) when you're looking at the window with the timeline, you can grab the timeline and compress it so the whole movie's timeline fits in the window you're working in, or drag it to the right and stretch it all out so you can get more granular control over the timeline and adding markers and cutting/pasting and editing.

It's easy to add multiple tracks, and pick which one's audio is played, but for some reason that I haven't figured out yet, it won't produce sound with an MKV.  It's not a codec issue on the computer, since MKV's play fine with other programs on here, including sound.  But within the program, there may as well not be an audio track.

And oddly enough, this version isn't letting me select a blu ray format as my end goal. Now I don't have a blu ray writer, which may be why, but I would've hoped it at least would've let me do that format on this PC as an image that I could later burn onto a blu ray disc elsewhere...  So apparently the Ultimate version, at least here, doesn't seem to support creating a blu ray format product.

Wipes look like they should be pretty easy as well, when you've added a portion (or entirety) of a video source to a project, and it shows up in whichever track you dragged it to, you can grab a corner and ""peel"" for a wipe.  You can right click it and select what kind of transition you want to do, but here's where I'm going to have to delve into the 21 days of training, since when I did that, the resulting change from one video track to the other never actually did any wiping effect or transitions, it was an abrupt, stark switch from video 1 to video 2 or 3.

It also supports 360 videos, and has some options and settings for it, but as I don't have anything that supports creating them yet, I couldn't test.

I like the insertion options though, to have a small picture in picture (or more than one) which is awesome for people with go pros and such to have the two streams, their view of what they're doing, and the view of their face that so many enjoy having as well.

The bottom line is that there's more power here than I'll ever use, but that is good, since it means the less ""pro"" level people, someone with a new baby for example who wants to start making home movies, will be able to get in here and do some really cool things, while still having the ability for the high end videophile to go beyond what the rest of us ""mere mortals"" would do.

For the price, it's awesome software, just takes time for people to get used to if they've never done this before.",Works well for novice users and higher end alike,1475107200,,

In short, this edition is only for children, people who have never used MS office before, or those using it only for the most basic of functinoalities.  Professionals, those used to versions 2000-2003, and those who need expert control of the program (i.e. macros and the like in Excel), then do not get this program, you'll have a tought time finding the same functionalities as in v. 2003.  But, since this is the special media edition, I did enjoy this one part of MS Office 2008.  It really does an excellent job of organizing all of my HD videos and photos, hence I give it 1 star over the regular version (which I rated a 3).  The visual interface of being able to see what files you are actually organizing instead of just icons and numbers really helps group the pictures and videos into exactly what I need, this is really a neat feature.  You can actually ""preview"" each media file without opening it, again saving you the time of figuring out what you are organizing.  Make sure, however, that you have more than the minimum system requirements for this special part of MS Office.  I put this version on one of my computers, I had more than enough RAM and processing speed, and the preview part would take up a lot of RAM, slowing down my computer quite a bit!!!

I'd reccomend staying with an earlier office product, and waiting for a new one to come out that is hopefully better for business professionals.  Creative individuals or those in the creative work profession will probably not have ad tough of a time with this edition of office as I did.

While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.

I can also tell you, however, that Premier probably isn't worth it for the vast majority of people, even if they have investments. The basic version will still allow you to fill out capital gains sheets. The only thing this really gives you is the ability to better handle rental property and gives you tools to value and maximize deductions. If you have a home business that doesn't have employees (and thus no payroll taxes) you can also get by with Deluxe, instead of Home Business. They don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with Premier and Home Business. It's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. They can't actually remove the ability for you to file your required personal taxes and so all versions have all the forms available. The main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.

My recommendation is that you save some money and start with Deluxe or Basic. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns.

First, VMware really rocks on my 8-core Mac Pro. For some reason I don't quite understand, it runs some Windows benchmarks within a virtual machine *faster* than booting Windows natively on the box! Graphics-intensive apps seem to do better natively, but anything that does lots of I/O seems to run faster under VMware.

The other thing I wanted to mention is that it's really more than just Windows on a Mac - you can run just about any Intel operating system within VMware. On my Mac Pro, I have Linux (both RedHat and SuSE/Novell) and a few other old Intel-based operating systems - even a very old OS/2.

This review will highlight some of the features of the WordPerfect Office Suite.

WordPerfect
-----------
- QuickCorrect
QuickCorrect (called AutoCorrect in Word) is a pretty standard feature in word processors nowadays but a feature unique to WordPerfect is SpeedLinks. SpeedLinks allows you to specify a ""Link Word"" (e.g. @Amazon) and a corresponding Web address to link to (e.g. Amazon's Web address). Every time you type in @Amazon, the ""@Amazon"" will be replaced with Amazon's Web address.

- Multiple File Formats Supported
You can convert a WordPerfect file into Microsoft Word and other word processor formats such as WordStar, XyWrite, and DisplayWrite. If your document contains tables, you have to the option of converting the document into MS Excel, OfficeWriter, QuattroPro, and Lotus 123 as well.

- Frustration-Free
I used Word for many years before I gave up on it almost entirely. I usually elect instead to create my documents in a plain text editor like Editplus, copy and paste it in Word, and ten add on the finishing touches, such as underlining, italics, and bold (which a plain text editor cannot do). The reason: formatting quirks (e.g. line spacing, indentation) in Microsoft Word can be absolutely exasperating! If you use Word on a regular basis, *you know* what I'm talking about.

Word processing not only works flawlessly in WordPerfect, it is incredibly easy to incorporate, format, and manipulate tables, pictures, and multimedia. I can concentrate on creating content without having to contend with software quirks.

Quattro Pro
-----------
Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program like Excel. However, There is a disadvantage of using Quattro Pro. Since the vast majority of people use Excel rather than Quattro Pro or any other spreadsheet programs, help resources are not as abundant as Excel. This will almost definitely not be an issue if you're using Quattro Pro for designing simple spreadsheet but it may be a concern if you're planning on designing more complex spreadsheets that involve more advanced features such as macros.

Quattro Pro is also incompatible with Excel. You cannot expect to easily migrate an Excel file in Quattro Pro and vice versa. If you're newbie on spreadsheet, my advice: go with Excel.

Presentations X5
----------------
Presentations X5 works a lot like Microsoft Powerpoint. You can easily create presentation slide shows. Presentations X5 allows you to insert pictures, sounds, spreadsheets, multimedia files (such as MPEG, AVI), and other objects.

Extras
------
- Create PDF's
New in X5 is a PDF Tool which allows you to turn any WordPerfect document into a PDF file. It can even convert image-based PDF files into editable content! Use it to add comments or mark up your PDF files. PDF files can be password-protected.

You can create high-resolution or low-resolution PDF's (high-resolution PDF's are best suited for printing and low-resolution PDF's are best suited for posting on the Web.) Note: PDF Tool is only available in the Standard and Professional versions of the WordPerfect Suite.

---
WordPerfect Office X5's forte is in its word processing program, WordPerfect. (Any wonder why Corel named its office suite after its word processing program?) I am very impressed by how easy it is to create and edit content in WordPerfect. Presentations X5 is a superb program as well. As for Quattro Pro, I do have slight reservations about recommending it to someone who uses its more advanced features, not because of any flaws inherent in the program, but because help resources are relatively scanty compared to Excel. All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the WordPerfect Office suite. The bottom line: if you need a word processing program and have only rudimentary spreadsheet needs, the WordPerfect Office X5 suite is definitely the way to go.",Finally -- Frustration-Free Word Processing,1280361600,6,

Mainly, I hoped to use the new PC migration assistant to bring an old WIndows XP desktop I rarely use over to my Mac. Unfortunately, this was much more difficult than it should have been, to the extent that I wonder if VMware adequately tests any of these peripheral functions. I found a bunch of obvious problems, mostly on the Windows side...simple things such as Windows services not being automatically started, permission problems and so on. There seem to be many similar tales on the Internet, so I don't think I'm alone in this. After struggling with it for several hours and getting nothing more than a ""General Error has Occurred"" message, I finally gave up. Instead, I installed VMware's vConverter (there's a free trial on the web site) and it promptly reported a problem with my volume shadow copy service. After changing a few settings, I was able to use vConverter to create an image of my old Windows XP system on a removable hard drive that I could bring into the Mac version of Fusion.

In fairness, once I got the virtual image over to VMware Fusion, it ran flawlessly - and notably faster than what I recall from Fusion 2.0. So far, I've had Windows up for several days with no instability or outages at all to complain about. I also have Vista and RedHad Linux virtual machines up, with no complaints at all - in every way, once you're up and running, Fusion 3.0 seems to be a better product than 2.0, although if you're new to virtualization and are relying on things like the PC migration assistant, you're likely in for a few surprises.

Let me start off by saying that I am not a professional publisher nor do I create magazine ads for a living.  I am a programmer who often has the need to creative professional looking graphics for internal webpages and the like.

Why can't there be a quality product for the rest of us that doesn't cost and arm and a leg?  And the answer is Corel Paintshop.  When I first installed the software, I wasn't expecting much - but after using it on several occasions, I can say that it is intuitive, easy to work with, and produces the same type of effects and functionality that I would use in Photoshop at 1/6 of the price.  Oh, I am sure that Photoshop can do more than this, but for your average person, I think that Paintshop is perfect.

It's definitely one of my new favorites! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited to Snake Horse Harbor to go whale watching with Katie Firestone. But when Nancy gets there, she discovers Katie's boat has been vandalized. Somebody in Snake Horse Harbor is up to something illegal, and it's up to Nancy to figure who it is! I thought that the plot was excellent. It was really intriguing and had lots of twists and turns and really kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot was so unique and fun, it's a perfect example of just how awesome Nancy Drew games can be!

CHARACTERS - 5/5: There was a good amount of characters in this game, and they all had incriminating evidence against them, so it was practically impossible to guess who the culprit was! There was Katie Firestone, a marine biologist who's nice, but virtually everyone in town hates her. Then there's Holt Scotto, and old school fisherman who's running for political office as Harbormaster. Jenna Dublin, who runs the local cafe and especially hates Katie. Then there's Andy Jason, who owns a whale museum and rivals Katie's whale watching tours. I think Andy was my favorite person to talk to because it was hilarious every time he said ""And remember...WHALES RULE!"" And, of course, there was the orca herself, who was very cute!

SETTING - 5/5: The setting was really well done. I've been to Washington State, and this game captured exactly what the beaches look like there. It was foggy, but very beautiful. Plus, the cafe was friendly feeling and the stained glass was really pretty. The whale museum looked just like a real museum. Everything in this game was so realistic. And the music was really cheerful and nice, and it never got annoying or repetitive, which was great.

PUZZLES - 5/5: The puzzles in this game were also wonderful. There was just enough so that you didn't feel like you were doing a puzzle every second, but you still always had something to do. Plus the puzzles were challenging, not so much that you get frustrated and want to quit, but just enough so that they're exciting and fun. That's another thing, the puzzles in this game were actually FUN, and as much as I enjoy this series, I can't say that a lot of the puzzles in the other games are fun. They're challenging, but not very much fun. But I can honestly say that I had a blast playing this game!

IS IT CHALLENGING?: Yeah, it's just the right amount of challenge. It was hard, but not so hard that I got frustrated or tired of it. It was really just perfect, I'd give it a 4.5.

ENDING - 5/5: The ending was so exciting. Snooping around, I really felt like I was in danger of being caught. Plus there was a big twist at the end in terms of revealing the culprit. I was surprised how scary the culprit got at the end, they just looked so evil! Catching them was fun, it took me a while to figure it out, but once I did I was very pleased. It was a fantastic ending to a fantastic game!

It's about as simple as it gets. Install the free AwareGPS app on your smartphone, set up your account and then plug the small device into the OBD port on your car (generally located underneath the dash below and to the left of the steering wheel. The port is keyed so it can only plug in one way.) That's it. The device instantly sends info to your smart phone concerning where the car has driven and at what time, whether or not the driver was speeding and by how many miles over the limit, how much gas is in the tank, whether the battery is functioning properly, if the device has been removed, etc. You can also follow your car's movements real time.

This is brilliant! Not only does it let you, the parent and car owner, keep tabs on your car, it lets the driver see his/her ""report card"" and helps them become better drivers (hopefully.) It would also be excellent for when deadbeat relatives want to borrow your car ""to run to the convenience store""...

It would make it very simple to track a car that has been stolen, too. This is something I really like since I live in a large city and actually had my car stolen some years ago. I hope I never need it for this purpose but I'm glad it's there.

The service costs $19.99/mo and you can start and stop service as needed with no penalties because there is no contract.

Breaches of the cloud storage areas are now more common, but to shut off an option that was convenient to me, and was, I felt, more secure on a local device or drive, is not the best idea.

While usually I prefer paying once for software, it's hard to look at the pricing and not see the value in considering the cloud version. You not only get 1 TB of cloud storage, you get the full suite of products, at a price that gives you two years of access for less than the standalone software costs. Of course, Mac users still don't get ALL the software that PC users get, and until they do, I will not give ANY Office version more than 4 stars at best. While I wouldn't tend to use Access as much these days, Publisher is software that absolutely should be included in the Mac version when PC users get it. However, this review is for Home and Student which only includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Note that Outlook is not included, something to be aware of if you are looking at purchasing this version, over the 365 Personal license which DOES include it. Of these, OneNote is the application I haven't used a whole lot, simply because I have so much in Evernote and haven't really had a need to look at migrating to OneNote. You can get OneNote as a standalone on the Mac Store for free, so it's worth looking at if you don't already use Evernote, but if you do want to use it, you almost certainly would want the 365 version so you have cloud storage for easy sharing of your notes across your desktop and mobile devices. Likewise a lot of the newer features in the other applications require cloud storage, such as sharing features. While you don't have to have a 365 license to use these, the only cloud services available are MS's OneDrive cloud service and Sharepoint. It's very annoying that they don't offer such popular cloud services like Dropbox but clearly they want to push users to get the 365 licenses instead which include the full 1TB of storage. If you don't need to keep a lot of docs on OneDrive though, the free account may work fine for you.

Now if you are a current Office for Mac user, the question is whether there are suitable updates here to look at upgrading. If you are more than 1 or two versions behind, it's pretty much a given that you would want to update, the new ribbon (toolbar) is much more elegant and user friendly, proper keyboard shortcuts are available, the various Mac touch gestures are supported, etc. And there's tons of improvements in the  applications themselves. I particularly loved the new theme designer feature in Powerpoint which gives you not only many more slide designs, but makes it really easy to switch them to different color schemes. Slide transitions are now better supported across PC and Mac versions and there is an improved presenter view, and dedicated animations panel. The formula designer in Excel has been updated, and there is better support for the full range of functions that the PC version had. More chart designs are now available, and comments in Word can now be fully threaded conversations. Print to PDF is better in all the apps, as well. Overall, the features definitely are worth a look, but the lack of Outlook and high cost for just the 3 main programs (OneNote being free to download anyway) does make it a bit hard to recommend this version over a 365 license. If you don't need Outlook, don't have a need to upgrade your apps very often, don't plan to use cloud sharing much, and mainly just want copies of the applications for cross-platform support with PC users that send you files, this might be worth considering versus the 365 version, but you'll need to use it for more than 2 years before you see any savings. So I rather the upgrade as a solid 4 stars, but I'd give this specific version only 3 stars for the value that you are getting for the price.",Worthy upgrade but MS clearly wants to push users over to the 365 versions,1445385600,7,

It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3. When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel. Based on the $150 difference in price between this version and the student/home version, I would seriously consider the student version.  It is my understanding that it is very similar, if not the same.  The Student/Home version apparently lacks the PDF capabilities of the Standard and Pro versions, so if you need those capabilities, buy this version.  (I would check with with Corel to be certain if all the features are present.)

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect. I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal. It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version. It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document. Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7. It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window. This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4. I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use. If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!
One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.
As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

But I'm not thrilled about the product to be honest.  I have 3 issues with norton:

1.  It is relentless in hassling you about renewals.  It gets a bit much when you are in the middle of something and the norton window blows you out of the game you were playing and such.

2.  One of the major benefits used to be the inclusion of an emergency boot disk when you bought norton.  Not anymore.  Now you open up the box and there is a single piece of paper with a ridiculously long code you have to go to the website and enter (really guys?  You can't use one of those codes that the camera can scan?)

3.  The virus protection isn't ""all that"".  I have an annoying virus on my laptop that norton seems to be helpless about.  I can google it, and find lots of people that have it, it's not some obscure one, yet running virus scans on norton always misses it.  It makes me wonder what ELSE norton is missing.

Still, I think the others are worse, and I do like that buying one product lets me install it on my laptop and desktop machines, and that a single subscription is managed in the cloud.  I do like that.  I just wish the product were a bit better... I feel like they are milking this product without improving it anymore, and in fact letting it rot a bit.

No problems with the install and no stability issues with the video editing program to date. But I am having significant problems importing media. Apparently, for example, not all MP4 files are created equal as far as this program is concerned. Or MOV files either. Some open. Some dont. I know quite a bit about video formats and I haven't called Sony Tech Support yet because I am trying to figure out the issue son my own.

 This is a nice video editor for beginners or more experienced editors who are looking for simplified workflow to turn out smaller projects faster (assuming you can import your video). The User Interface has a very clean deign and is reasonably intuitive. Making life somewhat easier for newer editors is having a Simple Edit mode and an advanced edit mode.

 I was able to knock out a small, simple project pretty quickly without needing to consult the Help file.

 Sony has produced some interesting add-ons that are available as downloads at modest cost. In my opinion, a few of the add-ons should have been built into the program, but others represent excellent value, so I guess it balances out.

 I admit to being focused on the media imkport problem since files from some of cameras cant be imported without being converted first, which annoys me. Also, I have not ued the auxillary programs yet.

 My initial impression, however, is that the video editor is excellent for new editors and for more experienced editors seeking more efficient workflow. This version won't replace adobe Premiere Pro  and isn't intended to  but it will do a fine job in handling the footage from your cameras and crafting a fairly complex video project without an overly steep learning curve.

 I like it and will be coming back to it once I resolve my media import issues.

But now that I'm older, I find myself really attached to it. I think what I disliked is that there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of running around and learning. Which also happened in Secret of the Scarlet Hand, though it was handled better there. So what makes me like it now? Well, it's the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending). And really, the learning isn't all that bad.

I appreciate the characters more now, and the ending. I love the ending. Also, after looking at several other games, I've come to love how everything works together. All of the puzzles help you in some way.

However, I wouldn't recommend this game to new-comers to the series, or to the impatient fans. It isn't the most exciting game, so if you're looking for a game to get into the series with I'd point you more towards Treasure in a Royal Tower or Secret of Shadow Ranch.

The last full version that I bought and used was Corel Draw 8, not counting the home and student license of X5 I bought (but never really used) during one of Amazon's Gold Box Deal sales. I got away from using it at that point when I got assigned to teach a digital graphics & animation class where they were using Adobe's Photoshop 5 and Illustrator 10. I eventually bought myself a license of Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium to use at home. And have since upgraded to their Creative Suite 5.5 - Design Premium. But now that Adobe has chosen to eliminate physical updates in favor for digital downloads (and maybe even going to an online application) I'm looking to go back to using Corel Draw. Nearly everything I need to do can be done with this new version of Photo-Paint and Corel Draw X7. You can even set the programs GUIs to mimic Photoshop's and Illustrator's.

The one thing that I have not liked about this new package - is that the content libraries are all on-line now. I found them to be a bit clunky to navigate and somewhat confusing as to what the three different badges were suppose to represent. I couldn't find any reference to one of the badges in any of the online documentation. Not really a big deal for me, as I hardly ever use the stock clip-art, and I still have all the stuff that came with my previous versions of the software.

The PDF manual that you can download is adequate for getting up to speed on the software - but I will be purchasing the CorelDRAW X7 The Official Guide (if and when it becomes available).

I like the new versions of the software, with maybe the exception of the Website Creator package. First off, it doesn't come on the installation disc - you have to download it off the internet. And it doesn't install with the software packages. But I think the main reason I didn't have a positive feeling about it, is when you open it you are presented a matrix of squares much like the new Windows 8 GUI. That really turned me off. Again, not that big a deal as I don't really do a lot of web page creating these days - and when I do, I like to code things by hand using plain HTML.

My husband and I were both impressed with what the program said it could do. It sounded too good to be true. We installed it on two desktop PCs and one laptop.

All the computers were slowed down to a snail's pace. Starting up the computer took at least three minutes (and seemed like a lifetime). Opening each program took so long, minutes to open an application!  Opening my (popular) email application and waiting for the download to happen took forever. The process by which it scans each email for viruses apparently takes a lot of time. To cope I'd end up opening the program, walking away and returning later to read the email.

Even using the computer doing simple tasks like changing to view the email program to use a word processing program was very difficult. I'd click on the other application and it would pause and nothing would move, then a minute or two later the screen would finally react. Flipping from one Internet browser to another would have long pauses and it `wouldn't go'.  Before installing this program I could flip to different Internet browser windows with immediate results. Trying to open new programs such as a spreadsheet program took forever and the cursor didn't seem to react, so I'd click on the icon again. In the end sometimes I'd end up with three of the programs open and ready to run.

I had the worst experience with using a (popular) photo altering program. That program kept locking up.

The long time that it took to access different programs and to switch from viewing the Internet to the word processor made the most basic computer work painstaking and time consuming. It was ridiculous. I have not experienced a computer being this way since the early 1990s when I was accessing the Internet through dial-up! To cope with the computer being this way, I took to reading something on paper while I waited for the system to catch up so I could do whatever it was that I was trying to do.

Also when starting up the system each day I'd get an urgent message that there was a problem! Guess what `the problem'  was? I had new documents that needed backing up. Give me a break--that is no urgent or emergency situation.

As such it was a real treat to test out both Corel VideoStudio Ultimate and Pro X7 (for more information on Pro, see respective product for more) and we've had very positive feedback on the Ultimate edition.

Our co-founder and marketing expert Tom tried the Ultimate version and quickly discovered that his laptop was not only grossly obsolete (Windows 7) but most of the features exclusive to the ultimate edition are more gimmicky than utilitarian.

After find Tom a suitable computer to work on, he began working on a Legend of Zelda project using in game footage we captured with an Elgato capture card and some live-action sequences we filmed.  One of the first things he began to experiment with was the 3D plug-in and quickly disregarded when his new PC didn't feel like supporting them that and we have no need for them.  The other premium plug-ins were the Hollywood-esque transitions and titles but they still resembled something a high school or film student makes in his bedroom so they're not that great.

However, what Ultimate missed in its plug-ins it makes up for in its comprehensive layout and use.  While not as streamlined as Final Cut Pro X, it still had a very easy-to-understand layout even for rookies like Tom to understand and master quickly.  The software is, relatively, user-friendly and that is a plus to anyone that doesn't feel like shelling out over $1000 in premium software or Mac products like I did.

All in all, I would probably recommend Pro over Ultimate since the premium features on the latter are less professional than one would think.  I'd keep things simple.","Gimmicky Features, but Solid AV Editor for Those That Aren't Necessarily Mac Fans",1400025600,,

Dragon naturally speaking Premier is speech recognition software from Microsoft Windows products. Amazon provided a group of us with copies in order to give our honest opinions of the product.

The package comes with a headset with an adjustable boom microphone, the installation DVD and some documentation. After reading the documentation, I installed the software on my Macintosh running Windows 7 under VMware fusion seven Pro.

I would've preferred a native Macintosh product, but VMware is usually quite good at these sorts of applications, so I have the utmost confidence that the Dragon software will perform the same on native Windows systems.

To use Dragon, one must speak in a clear, even tone and to 'say' the punctuation as one speaks. Naturally, this takes some getting used to, but it seems quite good at recognizing spoken punctuation.

Dragon allows the user to specify if they have any sort of accent when they speak, such as standard, British, Indian, Pakistani, Australian, etc. There is also the option of selecting one's vocabulary size and which speech recognition method to use.
Once the accent is selected, the user chooses the input method and is then asked to recites text containing tips on the use of the software in order to fine-tune how well the software works.

Once the software is active, the user is able to control it by saying phrases like ""wake up double quote and double quote stop listening to me"" this makes the package quite simple to use and for people with limited mobility may make life much easier.

Overall I am very impressed with Dragon naturally speaking software, although it does take some practice to become proficient. Until the user is completely at east (was supposed to be ""ease"") with the product, I recommend going back and proofreading the words that are dictated because things like a, will end up in speech if one is not careful our mom mom mom (I was saying 'uhm') on (in) the dictated text.",Easy to use dictation software.,1411171200,,

H.,"Many things can be said about this and competing products, most of them being aimed at editor features and render speed.  I'm going to stick to one subject only because this is where Corel gets it right where nobody else is:  ACTUAL QUALITY OF HD OUTPUT.

If all you want to do is make cute little youtube videos, then any junky editor will do because quality simply does not matter.  But If you want to make BluRays, listen up, Pespecially your PowerDirector fans:

I try every version of PowerDirector (including 12) that comes out, and end up running right back to Corel's VSX.  Why?  because no matter what kind of editing process/features you may enjoy about these two products, what does it all matter if the HD output is garbage?  Are you using this software to enjoy the editing process or are you using it to create good looking content?  Corel produces flawlessly beautifull, crystal clear HD content (I'm talking BluRay production here).  PowerDirector doesn't, and CANT.

Time and time again, no matter how I try with PD's limited controls, I can't get PD's BlueRay output to look good on a 55"" flatscreen.  It's grainy, pixilated, especialyl during pans or action sequences, which pixelate and blur BADLY.  Also, there is no render quality settings to fix this.  If you use PowerDirector, you are STUCK with this.  Corel, even with a bit if a dumbed down interface (but not much), has a boatload of output and quality options that allow you to drill down as far as you want to go to control every aspect of ouput quality and format.  This is really where Corel stomps all over PowerDirector - and always has.

Between these two products, there is only one difference that actually matters:  Output quality.  Everything else is just a bunch of worthless fluff.

The new 64-bit version just means that Corel's VSX is now on the same playing field as PowerDirector speed-wise, and PowerDirector has just lost its only bragging right against VSX.  But Corel has the edge in output options and quality, now making Corel's VideoStudio Pro the superior product.

My primary need is to have the ability to use layers and to make selective edits.  While X5 did those things, it was S-L-O-W (so much so that I stopped using it).  Granted I am running this on a laptop, but I've got to work with what I've got.  Its a newer laptop with an i5 processor and 8 gb of ram so its not bargain basement, but not top of the line either.  The new X6 is noticeably quicker.  It still takes a few minutes to load the program, but working on photos is much quicker.

For example, I sometimes stack photos varying the focal plane and then erase out of focus portions of other photos to end up with a sharp photo 'front to back' (AKA focus stacking or focus blending).  In X5, erasing was extremely laggy... I would have to make a stroke and then wait a few seconds for it to actually happen.  It was too laggy to be worth doing it.  In X6, the edits happen as I do them (as they should), so now I will be able to implement this technique on more photos.  Note that the photos I work on are TIF format, so they are large.  You may not have issues in X5 working with compressed jpegs.

Another nice thing is that I recently purchased the NIK collection plugins for Lightroom and I was able to load them as plugins for PSP as well.  One thing is you might have issues with Color Efex and Silver Efex, but there is a script you can download that will enable them to work.  Google ""Workaround for Nik Plugins on PSP X6"" to find them.

All in all, the capabilities that you have with X6 is an extreme bang for the buck and was worth it for me to upgrade from X5 to X6 just so I will be able to use it more!

Note to new photographers:  If you work with RAW files, you may still want to consider getting lightroom (student/teacher version is affordable... I know you have at least one teacher friend!) as it is much more streamlined for quickly working through your shoot and making basic edits.  You can make your changes without having to convert all your RAW files.  Then, for those few that need more advanced editing, you can launch PSP from LR by right clicking and selecting ""edit in..."" and selecting PSP (you have to set the path in preferences), which will convert your RAW to a TIF and open it in X6.  You may also want to consider adding NIK (search internet for 15% off coupon code) for cool filter effects and stunning black and whites.  There's your trifecta!

For those with artistic ability, SketchBook Pro is a powerful and productive tool, but for those with less talent it is a tool that allows even the most unskilled user to produce results with a small learning curve.

Installation is a painless and effortless undertaking. I was able to install the application with no issues at all and had a working installation in 5-10 minutes.

When Sketchbook Pro opens, rather than fill the screen with bunches of toolbars, widgets and other clutter, the user is greeted with a wide-open canvas, the ""lagoon"" toolbar in the lower left of the screen and a tool palette. The tool palette is easy enough to close and retrieve, but one thing that disappoints me is that is it not dockable. It is well-designed for docking and that it is either floating or off with no other options is a design decision with which I disagree. Hopefully AutoDesk will reconsider this and will change this in future releases.

For the uninitiated the lagoon is an arched toolbar that is parked in one corner of the screen and provides access to various tools and functions such as a color wheel, brush palette and more. It can be moved to either the lower left or lower right, and it can also be used to completely remove the menu bar from the top of the screen if desired. To pick a tool from the lagoon, the user clicks and holds on a lagoon icon, which opens a radial menu of icons to which the user drags the mouse to select the desired choice. This is a very different way of working and requires a little getting used to it, but it becomes second nature after using it for a while.

I observed that when the menu is removed from the canvas via the lagoon, SketchBook Pro inserts a wide band of unusable area across the bottom of the screen, and as a result there was no real space gain. The one advantage I found in this is that I can park the floating toolbar window in this unusable area which got it more out of the way, but otherwise I do not understand why the application works in this manner. If the idea was to give a maximum of workable space, it doesn't (at least, not directly).

SketchBook Pro is not the most advanced or powerful drawing program out there but it is packed with a surprising amount of features and tools to make even people with limited artistic talent productive. It has a variety of pens and brushes and each of these can be tweaked for size and intensity (as well as color, of course), but there's a lot more than just drawing implements. The ruler is an especially useful tool that I have not encountered in other applications, at least in the same way SketchBook Pro's works. It is more of a straight-edge tool rather than a ruler and allows the artist to make straight, precise lines with no worry of slipping or overshooting the distance. My favorite set of tools in the tool box is the reflectivity (symmetry) options, that create mirror images of what you draw as you're drawing. This can be a time saver.

The help system is top-notch and is arguably the best help system I have seen with an application of any type. It is a browser-based help system, very easy to follow and very well-designed with lots of eye appeal. Searching and finding information is straightforward and easy, and the overall system is very responsive.

AutoDesk has done a nice job with SketchBook Pro 2011. It is powerful and very easy to use and is well suited for the casual doodler as well as professional artists. There are a couple of design decisions in the interface that are puzzling but these are matters of personal taste, and overall the clean, uncluttered canvas gives the artist more room in which to work than most other applications of this type. At the price point, SketchBook Pro 2011 is an excellent application for drawing and sketching and is worth serious consideration if you're looking for such an application.",Excellent drawing/illustration tool for all skill levels,1288483200,71,

Will
Health Care Directive (Living Will & Power of Attorney
Durable Power of Attorney for Finances
Final Arrangements
Information for Caregivers and Survivors

At the end of the first section (Will), it offers to do a search for local attorneys to review your will. I live near Houston and there was only one estate planning attorney on their list. It asks you to fill out a few basic questions and asks for the size of the estate. And then it emails your request for review to the attorney.  I haven't gotten past this step. I can probably expect to be requested to make an appointment with the attorney for some unknown cost.

This fill in the blanks style of generating a will seems too simple. I seriously doubt that it is sufficient to hold up in court. So even though this software is inexpensive, I think the greater cost will be follow-up with an estate attorney of their choosing. I'm sure Nolo gets a kick-back referral fee from the attorney they recommend.

My personal opinion is that the will should be coupled with a prenuptial agreement or a post nuptial agreement for best overall protection. That is my plan for the time being.

It has changed very little since that time, but each year (as with most popular software) it is updated and a new version is put on the market. Older versions came with a book from Nolo explaining various legal terms and information about living trusts. The current 2016 version offers online access to the living trust software for free for 1 year, but that implies a subscription thereafter, however the cost of that access is unclear.

I purchased this, the newest version, more as a curiosity than a need. Having used both the 2011 and 2013 versions - neither is supported by Nolo anymore thus current legal changes (which may or may not be the case for your state) don't show up on the forms in the software. There's no way to tell if your state will have any changes to specific forms for years to come, thus using older versions of this software is probably OK - but there's no real way to know.

This software can be installed via CD or by going to a download site (with the code in the box) and installing it following the download to your computer. Easy to do, and it automatically updates the software upon installation.

NOTE:  If you need to re-install the program, you can again download it and re-input your activation code or use the CD.  See photo for what comes in the box.

-----------------------------------------

RE: OLDER VERSIONS

If you are considering saving money by purchasing and older version of this software, just be aware your state may have some forms that have been updated and those updates won't be visible to you if updates are not supported.

I currently use the 2013 version - updated from the 2011 version - and noticed no real difference in the two for my state. No updates to the forms took place in those two years. I could add both programs to multiple computers without an issue (Windows 7 and 8 PCs) and it could be used by multiple users. The information inputted into one program was imported by the updated version and thus I only had to put in the info one time.

One thing that will happen with older versions though is that when you go to do the 'Web Update' in the software, you will receive a message stating that that version is no longer supported by WillMaker.

When I receive that message I click out of it and an update starts, but the update is only for the year of the software. For example in the 2013 version, the only updates the software received was for the year 2013. Legal changes to forms for other years did not show up.

Frankly, it's just a ploy to keep you buying the updated software - and the combination of the update and an Amazon Lightning Deal got me again. (Twenty-seven bucks was a small price to pay for this one.) **Not showing up as a 'verified purchase', despite having been purchased on Amazon. *

----------------------------------------

WHY YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THIS SOFTWARE

Overall this is a great DIY-kit for those who don't have the money to pay attorneys for these services, but truly it's much more than that because it includes so many useful forms and can be used by several people. The interview format makes filling out the forms easy to do, and there's room to customize if desired. The resulting documents are legally binding, but in most cases do need signatures with witnesses to make it so.

If you have elderly parents, if you have children, if you have assets you want specifically dealt with in a certain way... this software is a cheap investment in protecting them all.

If you already have a Living Trust or a Will, and don't need all the forms (listed below), you can skip getting it, but I suspect if you're reading this review - you're not one of those people. Truly, it's worth the money and peace of mind.

-----------------------------------

ABOUT THE CURRENT VERSION:

The 2016 version states it will work with Windows Vista, 7 and 8. I'd like to assume it would work with 10 too, but the Amazon description doesn't indicate that so I went to Nolo's website and found this info.

Not only is this an impressive, powerful suite of graphics design tools, Corel doesn't throw you under the bus as soon as you install the software.  If you're like me and don't have a single artistic bone in your body (I can't draw a straight line with a ruler), you would expect a fancy-pants software package like this to leave you dumbfounded from the start, with no clue on how to get started.  Much to their credit, Corel throws you lifelines as soon as you jump in the pool and makes a diverse set of rescue resources near at hand for you at all times.  I'm not saying you'll be a graphics design guru after a couple of hours - this is a really advanced,  powerful set of programs here - but you would have a hard time finding a piece of software with more impressive built-in support.  The first of several excellent video tutorials is available on the Welcome screen, and you can choose to have a built-in docket of usage tips available for every function you choose.  Users of previous versions of the software will have no problem recognizing the changes this upgrade brings with it, as you can choose to have every single change and addition from your previous version highlighted on the screen.  That doesn't sound like much, but it is a big help.  You also have What's New and Learning Tools readily available to you from the Welcome screen as well as from inside each of the featured programs.  Of course, you also have a complete help file available but you won't need to resort to using that very often.

As I'm sure you can tell by the price, you don't buy this program if you just want to take the redeye out of your vacation photos or create a cute little Christmas card to send to friends.  You can certainly do those things with this, but Corel Photo-Paint X4, impressive as it is, is overshadowed by the primary CorelDRAW application.  (If all you want is a powerful photo editor, I would still recommend Fireworks - my favorite - or Photoshop.)  I would like to have seen a few more built-in templates included, but CorelDRAW actually succeeds in making graphics design possible for even artistically inept folks like me.  This is one powerful program which actual graphics professionals should take to like fish to water.  Professionals may be the primary target audience for this software package, but Corel does a great job of making these powerful tools available and actually useable by anyone.

I also have to mention several additional software applications and features included in this suite deal.  Corel PowerTRACE X4 is of enormous help in turning traced bitmaps into images you can convert into editable vector images.  Corel CAPTURE X4, as you might guess, is a powerful screen capture utility.  The Bitstream Font Navigator is a comprehensive font manager that even helps you identity scanned fonts from an outside source.  You even get a Duplexing Wizard to aid you in optimizing the appearance of your document when printing two-sided copies.  Vista users will also welcome the integration of this software package with the Vista operating system, as the search and preview options by themselves should be of great convenience to them.

What about file formats and the age-old question of compatibility?  After all, the odds are that some if not many of your associates are working with different file formats in non-Corel software.  Well, Corel has worked to make CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 software as compatible as possible with other users and systems.  In this release, the list of additional new formats includes Word and Publisher 2007, AutoCAD DXF and AutoCAD DWG, and Adobe CS3.

I could go on writing paragraph after paragraph about this product, but I could never begin to describe all of its many impressive features.  Is it the best graphics design software on the market?  I don't know, as I have no experience using any comparable graphics design programs.  Even if I had, I don't think anyone short of a professional graphics designer would be able to judge the comparative pros and cons.  What I do know is that anyone who is serious about graphics design in any of its various facets would do well to give CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 a long and serious look.",An unprecedented combination of graphics design power and usability,1227657600,3,

Cyberlink PhotoDirector 5 Ultra is new to me and I must say I was immediately impressed by some of the features.

For one thing, Photo Director didn't try to grab and re-catalog every picture file on my hard drive as some other programs do.  It allowed me to select the photos I want to open.

PhotoDirector didn't balk when opening CR2 files (Canon RAW).  With some other packages, I've had to open and convert my RAW files to JPGs in the camera's software before the software would open with them for further editing.  Since that's a non-issue with PhotoDirector it saves a lot of time.

PhotoDirector includes a lot of editing features; some are standard in photo editing packages (Tooth Brush, Eye Blinger), others were new to me (Body Shaping). I found the separation of Skin Smoother and Wrinkle Remover helped with control and produced a less ""plastic"" looking result.  I like the Content Aware Removal and Smart Patch, but these are two areas that are going to require some practice by the user. I also like the Watermark Creator and WaterMark Templates that are included.  If you're a social media user, you can save and upload a photo to Facebook from PhotoDirector. If you're into HDR photography, you can bracket up to 5 shots with PhotoDirector.

Any photo editing software that does this much has a learning curve, especially if you're used to another package.  So, I was also impressed that the PhotoDirector 5 package included a 117 page manual in the box, including a list of hot key shortcuts.  There is also a handy Help link that is both indexed and searchable so you can figure out how to accomplish an effect while you're working.

What I like most about PhotoDirector is that it does some of the things I commonly need with my photo editing, but have been switching between other programs to accomplish - opening and preliminary editing of RAW files with camera software, to basic clean up and editing with PS Elements, to Watermark and Slideshow with Lightroom.  For basic needs, PhotoDirector has simplified my work flow.

It is Vista home premium with SP1. I rather like it. I have read numerous reviews that don't like it so much, so I am giving my experience here for those, like me, are considering a new computer with pre-installed Vista. My question was: How is Vista better than XP?

Answer: It looks better!

I am not joking. The only attraction is the aero effect thing where a little bit of each window is slightly transparent, the windows also pop up with a magical effect, like a balloon. It disappears the same way too, with some transparency worked in. It has an option of extra large icon that's really big if you want it, though that takes up screen space fast. The files are also a little bit open you so you can see a file or two in there, but in XP you can see stuff inside too, as many as four things, so the open trick isn't much of an improvement. Also, you can get these things called ""Vista Gadgets"" for the desktop, like a little calender or a battery charge indicator or even a quick search to amazon that just sits there as part of the desktop. Other program covers it, but otherwise it runs on its own without bothering anything.

(And why do I want a quick search to amazon, you might ask, if I already have it bookmarked as a favorite page? Well you see, you still have to click to open a webpage first before you can click your favorite. With the amazon gadget, you just type directly into it what you want, and a webpage will pop up without you having to click to open it! Really saves on the finger energy, you know?)

Other than this, there is nothing to Vista whatsoever that is different from XP. There is heightened security measures in the form of ""OS fearfulness"", but I always disable those things as much as possible because they are nothing but a nuisance. Whenever you want to do something it asks, ""Are you sure?"" It can't tell if something is wrong, mind you. It just keep asking YOU, and you have to keep assuring it like it is a scared child. And I can't disable all of it because then it nags constantly, ""Security setting is set too low! Please raise it!""

There are a few minor inconveniences. First, the standard picture viewer will not display GIF images, unlike the one in XP. The help part explicitely states that the viewer will ONLY display bmp and jpg format pictures. Also, the Windows Mail, the equivalent of Outlook Express, no longer has the contact pane where you can just double click any contacts and opening a black email to write. You have to open the contact file each time.

Also, the included Internet Explorer has a ton of problems. It freezes every time I go to my hotmail account. I know, they are both Microsoft, so why can't they get along? Who knows. It freezes on certain other sites too, for no particular reason. I don't have any trouble with the old IE in XP, but Vista does not allow you to downgrade. (My Netscape in Vista manages hotmail and other pages just fine, so that's what I use.)

A friend warned that my old programs might not install in Vista. I've installed a few now. So far, everything works.

So here is the conclusion: except for the pretty translucent aero effect, Vista is identical to XP in every way if you don't think about the few bugs. So if you are into pretty (like me), do get it. It looks cool! It's fun watching the windows pop open and then vanish when you close it! But if you think that sounds stupid, then there is no question XP with SP2 is better in the sense that it is more stable and have fewer bugs.

I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed that the aero thing is all that I am getting out of a brand new operating system.

After shooting 3 hours of HD video during a family wedding, I wanted to put together a decent disc as a gift to the bridge and groom.  There are a ton of products on the market, but this suite and its companion website community is significant.  I started with the AVCHD formatted video extracted from the MINIDV tapes and didn't know how to use the interface and tools.  Opening the help system takes you to the web based manual and instruction system, but I wanted more of a personable approach to the tools.  Thankfully Cyberlink has a significant amount of ""how-to"" on Bing Video and YouTube.  After an hour of watching the educational videos, I was clipping my raw video into sections, using the Wedding express project to begin my menu and transitions.  By far this isn't a difficult tool to use, but its massive.  Only by reading the manuals or by online videos will I even know all of the features and options for setting up my video, and I'm duly impressed with the amount of options installed by default and custom and user shared content and objects on their powerdirector community website.  I'll probably have 10 hours into this wedding video by the time of this review and I'm tempted to hold off on the final cut until I watch a few more use videos to ensure I didn't miss anything.

Of the features, cleaning up the video and stablizing the video added the most value to the non-tripod video that I used as source.  While my Sony Cam has great color, my lighting wasn't always ideal, and the brightness levels of some dark shots was easy to lighten to get a better view inside the reception hall.  Transitions and animations were outstanding.  For those that are looking for a full featured video editing and compositing solution, this seems to cover everything that an amateur would want.

For those worried about system specifications, my system is a Windows 10 4th gen i7 with 16GB of memory using SSD storage for editing.  My graphics card is an Nvidia 860 based GPU and I didn't have any issues in editing a 20GB m2t AVCHD source file and all transitions.

I'm a lawyer and I find the ability to do things with hot-keys rather than clicking through a bunch of menus or guessing which hieroglyph on a ""ribbon"" performs a rarely-used function is a huge time-saver.  I simply COULD NOT write efficiently without Reveal Codes -- if I either need to see why something isn't right or I need to do some odd stuff, just press F11 and there is all the ""behind the scenes"" stuff.

I also like the fact that when I add things like Widows and Orphans control, Keep Text Together, etc., it ACTUALLY DOES. I hate when in Word I click on something like Keep Text With Next -- and nothing happens.

I was using X4 and the version I had didn't come with a ""migrate setting"" option. X6 gave me that option and it migrated virtually everything. I noticed it didn't use my highly customized template (completely different menus, custom toolbar, custom keyboard). I was slightly annoyed and went to copy my ""X4 custom"" to ""X6 custom"". The install had already done that. The only thing it didn't do was set my Default Template to the new copy. I pointed Default Template to the new copy, changed Default Document Folder, set the Theme I like, and it's good to go.

A few problems I'm sure haven't been fixed, so I might as well mention them.  (I reported them to Corel years ago on numerous occasions but they never fixed them.) When certain formatting is to be applied to selected text that crosses a page boundary, the formatting is only applied up to the page boundary.  For instance, I sometimes have to block-indent several paragraphs that cross a page boundary. I hilite the text and press F4 (left indent) or Shift-F4 (left-right indent).

Instant Immersion makes the mistake (for me, anyway) of going through all the basics first - numbers, months, days, blah blah. Useful but boring. Pimsleur says the same phrase umpteen times. And so on. So this approach seems the best so far in terms of interest, and some of my comments will seem like nitpicking, but it could be better.

Rosetta starts with matching words to pictures, and includes hearing, speaking, reading, and writing. You can choose which of these activities to include, but you can't fine tune it to have just reading and no writing. You have the option of displaying simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, pinyin, or both. If you choose both, however, the pinyin is shown above the script in a font that's a little too small for easy reading on a 13.1"" or 14.1"" laptop screen. The title text at the top is also unclear, even on fullscreen, because it's antialiased, but that's not a huge problem, since it doesn't affect the lesson. Other than that, the interface is bright and pleasant and refreshingly different from the normal Windows dialogs.

The lessons available are limited to about half the full content until you activate the product, i.e. tie it to one PC. I've heard horror stories about transferring the activation, so be warned.

The picture/word matching thing seems to work for the most part, but there are sometimes problems. Is that a boy or a girl? What are they doing? Hard to say at first glance, since they use a couple of different pictures for the same word. Also feels strange to match ""he is not doing this""-type phrases to the pictures of someone ... er ... not doing it.

Because it's an immersion-type course, sometimes you have to figure out what's going on with little or no explanation - for example the different numeratives (""one tail of fish""). You aren't told why a bicycle is called what it is. But that's part of the immersive learning process.

The program defaults to moving along automatically. Problem is, there are pages where it should stop for you to review, but it doesn't - it moves along after a second or two. If you set it to manual, you have to advance by clicking on the button for the next lesson - from a tiny row of boxes at the bottom. That could've been designed better.

In general, response is slow - a couple of seconds to get to the next page, for instance. It's a little annoying because you're not sure if the program recognized your input, so ... get used to it, or get used to clicking twice just in case.

I've heard many actors simply butcher Mandarin in movies or on TV (Serenity *cough*). For those of you having trouble with the accent, may I suggest that you think of it in terms of singing the phrase, see if that helps.

Is it worth it? If you want to learn the language at your own pace, and the price is within your budget, I would say yes. I give it three stars because of the price and the room for improvement - and the activation requirement.

As a long-time user of Corel's ""Graphics Suite"" bundle of graphics software, this is my first experience with their Photo/Video bundle, even though I have also previously used both the separate ""VideoStudio Pro X2"" and ""PaintShop Pro Photo X2"" packages.  What makes this bundled package so attractive is that for a very competitive price (especially now that their X4 versions are released), you get a set of very useful software for editing both photos and videos.

PaintShop Photo Pro X3 continues to improve ever since Corel acquired it from Jasc Software in 2004, and the new X3 version offers better RAW support along with new features for manipulating and carving objects out from an image and scaling images.  Of course, PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is not Photoshop, but it is also farrrrrr more user-friendly to photo enthusiasts who just want easy-to-use options for correcting and enhancing their photos without lots of fuss.  There are lots of cool, useful, interesting, or sometimes strange special effects that you can apply to your photos, ranging from giving people suntans to removing facial blemishes and age wrinkles to even making people look skinnier (a timely special effect, considering the population obesity that is on the rise).  Although not a huge improvement and rework of the X2 version, PaintShop Photo Pro X3 continues to enhance its ""Photoshop For The Masses"" approach to photo editing.

As for VideoStudio Pro X3, I previously used VideoStudio Pro X2 and I really liked its ""Movie Wizard"" mode as a wonderful way to ease the learning curve and let you create professional-looking videos quickly for instant gratification.  The X3 version improves upon X2 with new filters and templates.

Corel Painter Essentials 4 provides a fun limited subset of the functionality found in the full ""Painter"" software.  ""Painter"" occupies a very unique niche in its ability to manipulate photos and turn them into images that look like oil paintings, watercolors, pastels, and pencil sketches.  I also have ""Corel Painter 11"" and there are sometimes photos and situations where Painter's abilities cannot be replicated by any other photo editing software (yes, not even by using the full-blown Photoshop).  One of my favorite ways to use Corel Painter is to convert a landscape photo or portrait into a French Impressionist painting; either printing this out or displaying it on a Web page always gets compliments.

As with Corel's Graphic Suite (I have their X4 version), the software comes with printed User Guides, a 137-page PaintShop Pro X3 User Guide, a 155-page VideoStudio Pro X3 User Guide, and a separate ""Getting Started Guide"" for both of these too. I like a combination of a printed User Guide along with more detailed searchable help information that is accessed from within the software, and I could never understand software companies who just have a lone CD floating around in a cardboard box without including hardcopy guides/documentation or, even worse, software that requires you to be connected to the Internet because all the documentation is posted on an external Web site.  Compared with each of Corel's Graphic Suite applications (i.e. Corel Draw and Corel Photo-Paint), the applications in Photo and Video Pro X3 feel like they run a bit slower.  PaintShop Photo Pro X3, in particular, seems to feel slower with each new version as it incorporates new features.  You definitely need at least 2-GB of memory on your computer, and it would help if you shut down other applications if you are performing extended photo and video editing.

Most retail offerings are overpriced, difficult to install, and confusing to maintain.  And then the cherry on top is that they typically bog down your computer's performance while letting the bad stuff through anyway.

But PC Tools Internet Security 2009 has turned me around on this topic.  It installed easily on my Windows XP (sp3) workstation after I had removed my prior security suite (begone forever, Norton 360!), including automatically retrieving all of the latest updates.  Registration was as simple as providing the product key and my email address - immensely less obtrusive than the Norton runaround.

The dashboard is easy to read, visually separating its protection against spyware, viruses, spam and intrusion (i.e. firewall) into different portions of the screen.  Globally useful information such as the most recent scan date and how many days are left on your subscription are placed in immediate view - no digging required.  Click any of the protection panes and you get detailed information including helpful links for setting runtime options and viewing historical results.  It's all very user-friendly and intuitive.

PC Tools really shines during routine use.  Aside from the times when it was running an update, the software's footprint was very manageable, both in terms of CPU and memory usage.  So no more slowdowns during browsing.  And it manages to provide this protection without cluttering up your browser with any branded toolbar nonsense - imagine that, Norton!

Its schedule, thresholds and notifications are all simple to customize so that you get the level of protection that you want without going overboard with non-stop messages and warnings.  Their IntelliGuard feature is aimed at ensuring ongoing protection while not overloading the average user with technical minutiae.  Let's face it - the average Internet user doesn't know (or even want to know) hot to properly configure his or her firewall.  IntelliGuard does a good job of doing it for the user, sparing a lot of the confusion which can actually lead to loopholes in security.

Its scans seem to be very thorough - it immediately picked up lots of resident malware and other nonsense that Norton had quietly let live on my PC for who knows how long.  This version also touts a new ""Behavior Guard"" feature that supposedly catches potential threats based on monitoring suspect activity in the OS of your computer.  Put another way, a virus doesn't have to become ""known"" and added to everyone's update list for you to be protected from it.  How well does it work?  Well, that's difficult for the layperson to assess, but I can tell you that a month in, I'm yet to have any virus or malware-related problems and I feel much more confident than I ever did with any other retail suite.  I'll certainly update this review if anything bad happens under PC Tools' watch, however.

The PC Tools Internet Security suite comes bundled with licenses for one year of protection for three computers, so it's also a good value compared to the retail competition.

This may supplant Roxio Media Creator as my go to program for editing.  I would put its control scheme on a par with Roxio, which is far better than iMovie.

As someone who shoots family movies and wants basic editing, this more than does the trick.  Nevertheless, it is able to handle 3D editing, 4K video (assuming you have a 4K camera and a couple of terabytes on your drive to store the video!)

The next year, it's a single stock sale causing me to need Premier instead of Deluxe. Is this by design?

I think intuit needs a better business model. Perhaps allowing you to buy single form add-ons for $1-2 each, instead of one form being a $20-40 upgrade to the next TT tier.

The application stopped working for me over the weekend.  Launching MyDVD put me into a never-ending loop of Windows Installer popping up.  I haven't touched the configuration of EMC-10.  Trying a repair in Control Panel | Add/Remove programs failed asking for files on a network.  I can no longer create DVDs without getting one of many obscure error codes.  The knowledgebase article at Roxio support about the installer loop said I needed to completely uninstall the product from my PC and reinstall.  The uninstall took forever because of the myriad of components EMC-10 installed without a unified uninstaller.  I am definitely NOT reinstalling this software.  I have never had an experience like this with any software package I've installed.  No way I am putting up with it.  I will be requesting an RMA today.  I am going to try Adobe instead.  At least they have a 30-day trial without having to pay up-front.  ZERO STARS!

[Original review:]
I downloaded the install for EMC-10 and was able to install the software, get it to run without crashing and produce a nice DVD from movie clips and a photo slideshow complete with background music.  This is the only part of the suite I've used so far and it worked brilliantly.  I would even say it was ""quick"" and I am using a Dell 9300 laptop with a Pentium M 1.6GHz processor and only 1GB of RAM.  I live in fear of trying the other parts of the application until I upgrade to 2GB.

The DVD burning and editing went much faster than MyDVD 5.5 and actually worked unlike MyDVD 9 (see below).  The end product is really good looking with only a few issues.  The things I don't like about the final DVD product is that the main menu music will not play for more than 60 seconds and the highlighted menu suffers from all kinds of aliasing problems with the font.  I also noticed the first few notes of any background music for a menu is lost.  The video quality is very nice taken from Motion JPEG files and 3ivx MPEG-4 files from a Canon 850is and Flip video camera, respectively.  The background music sounds great encoded as AC-3.

The nightmare was all before getting EMC-10 installed when I upgraded from MyDVD 5.5 to MyDVD 9.  Today a software package is no good without a good website, documentation and tech support.  So, while this part might not seem relevant I would beg to differ.  First, I had no clue that EMC-10 included MyDVD 10 or I certainly would not have bought MyDVD 9.  Nothing in the EMC-10 product pages indicated MyDVD was inside and version 10.  I also didn't know that MyDVD 9 would not support the files recorded from my Flip video camera.  Once again, nothing on the website saying that it does not support 3ivx MPEG-4.  Nothing on the website indicated any of this.  I figured it out reading the forums from other users.

If anything does go wrong with EMC-10 I already know I am hosed trying to use their website, documentation or support.  I am still waiting for a response from their customer support on my refund for MyDVD 9.  The instructions on their website for getting a refund don't work at all.  It can't even find my order number.

Five stars for the product features that I've used and minus two stars for the website behind the product.

[Update:] Roxio has a click-to-chat feature on their website.  I got a service rep right away and he gave me a phone number to call Digital River - the Roxio online store.  I called the number and after about 3-4 minutes on hold talked to a friendly agent who promptly sent me to a link where I clicked a couple of buttons to get my refund.  I got an email today confirming my refund for MyDVD 9.  No questions asked.  If only my call later with Comcast had gone so easy :-).",I seem to be one of the lucky ones?,1199750400,,

I have tried other alternatives, and they just don't work the way I would expect them to. Having used Microsoft Office for the PC in the past for all of my office needs, I could not find anything that worked quite the same on my Mac. Printing would be off, or text would not look right, and just a lot of small things that made me feel that I needed to keep looking for the right program to edit spreadsheets and documents on my Mac.

Behold: Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac! This is the newest version of Office for the mac! The settings and options I am used to having are all there! Commands have the same name I am familiar with! Documents and text look the way I would expect them to when I create/edit them and even when I print them! I felt at home!

The menu system does take a bit of getting used to. Instead of being a traditional Menu Bar like Office 2003 (what I am familiar with) it has a style more like Office 2007 - but with the menus detached from the main document window. This takes a little getting used to, but actually is much better with my wide screen monitor. I still prefer the old Office 2003 style menus, but I would say these are a bit more useful then the ones present in Office 2007. Also, the update system can be annoying if you set it to always check for updates. I get a pop-up window every time, but would have preferred if it checked in the background and then just let me know when new updates were available.

Installation took a bit. Not too terribly slow, but it was a bit time consuming. All of this was well worth it though, as any Office program I run starts up very fast! I was impressed with the loading speeds. I expected fairly fast loading due to the major efforts put into the new Microsoft products to decrease loading times, but I still expected it to take a bit longer. Word or Excel load about as fast as Firefox or any other lean program! MUCH faster than an alternative I had been using previously.

After using alternatives, and having become accustomed to the PC version - I found Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac to be a wonderful and necessary software suite for all of my document needs.

When it comes to the world of personal finance software, we as the general public have very limited choices.  I've used Quicken since the DOS days and moved over to Money, then back to Quicken.  My most recent version was 2006.  I booted it up and it told me it was time to upgrade because they will stop supporting online downloads come 4/30/09.  Initially I was pretty hacked off...like a lot of others here.  Then I took a deep breath, and did the math.  I think my Deluxe version cost me about $20 somewhere (eBay perhaps??) so let's do the math together shall we?  $20/3 years is about $6.67 a year.  Holy Break The Bank Batman!!  Seriously people. Quit griping.  How about you not drink 2 Starbucks all year long and put it in your ""Upgrade Quicken"" jar.

This upgrade cost me $39 direct from Quicken and took 17 minutes to download.  So let's do the math for the next 3 years, shall we? $39/3 years is a wallet busting $13 a year!!  Skip your $5 footlong at Subway 3 times all year long and you can afford the upgrade...amazing isn't it?

The upgrade was flawless on my XP machine.  Double-clicked the start-up icon and away we went.  It found my previous version and un-installed it, installed the new version and ran for the first time.  It immediately found an update so I accepted it.  After the update, the program opened to the main screen.  All of my files imported flawlessly and I was downloading my newest transactions immediately thereafter.

One of the best improvements is how you can copy digital images into the register.  In my old version, I had to save the file to my desktop and then add it through a few clicks.  Now all I have to do is right click the image, click copy, open Quicken attachment and paste from clipboard.  Genius I tell you!

The interface has a very ""gel"" ""XP"" look to it.  I'm not a real big fan of that look, but I'm not going to rate it 1 or 2 stars because of it.

There are numerous options available.

My interest was caught with this because I have some printed documents that I no longer could find the original files for. Scanning them in, I was able to create word documents that pretty much mimicked the original.

As a test, I took my car insurance card and scanned it. Omnipage formatted it and organized it to lay out exactly like the card does (other programs with OCR simply jumble all the text together). Actually, what I saw on screen was exactly the insurance card but it was editable.

The biggest issue I had was with hand written documents. Trying to port these in to edit in a typed word document just didn't work. I am not really surprised at this and I did not expect it to work but I thought I'd mention it. I did use this to scan in a form that I wanted to be able to update. Omnipage created the tables and everything. I had to make a few minor edits but it wasn't much.

Naturally, simply scanning a document into a PDF is easy and it works pretty much like Adobe Acrobat would for this.

I had originally hoped it would be a viable desktop OS going forward but unfortunately it seems this is not to be. Microsoft made some much needed changes to the desktop experience after the Windows 8 disaster, however they did this at some expense to the touch experience. The user interface continues the flat, sparse trend that started with Windows 8. The icons look like placeholders hastily drawn in mspaint and the whole interface just feels stripped out, sparse and unfinished with huge amounts of screen-wasting white space. The result is an operating system that still doesn't come close to Windows 7 on the desktop and isn't as good as Windows 8 on a touch device. On top of that, it throws out any performance advantage Win8 may have had over Win7, and it feels more like a platform to push Microsoft subscription services and paid apps than a desktop operating system. Then there are the mandated updates which are not limited just to security patches but can include arbitrary changes to the UI or features. In a nutshell, by obsessing over this one OS, one experience across the board, Microsoft has created the Spork of operating systems that tries to be everything to everyone and doesn't do a particularly good job at anything.

It was pretty good software, lightweight and powerful.  Over the years security products evolved with more features, and while Norton added those features, it got bogged down by them and became more bloated and slower.  I stopped using Norton products several years ago when this line was called systemworks, but decided to give 360 a shot on my Windows 7 PC.

Installation was fairly simple, and there isn't much to configure, which can be good for novice users.  I personally would prefer more options.  The software is pretty and seems pretty friendly.  It handles antivirus and malware protection, system cleaning, and even annoying popups on my browser to ""warn of unsafe websites"".

Turbo Tax helps make sure I don't miss something. After a full pass through the whole tax process it offers a review to ensure there isn't something I left out.

I used to use a tax attorney but realized I was doing all the work by bringing all my paperwork to him, then he would interview me and pass the results onto a service that would enter the data (probably into something like Turbo Tax). One year I found a big tax deduction that the attorney forgot to ask about. At that point I dumped the whole idea of having someone else do my taxes. I had found this big deduction using Turbo Tax.

Wolters,"I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.
Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.
Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a ""classic"" Windows 9x view.
Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party ""usage tracking"" cookies that are placed on your PC.
Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that ""DOS EMULATORS"" will be available for purchase in the near future.
Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.
For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.
For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.
There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.",The First MUST Upgrade since Windows 95,1003708800,4,

Trend monitors your internet activity and squashes spyware, viruses, malware, and more before they have a chance to infect your computer.

I have had very good success with Trend security software and my previous satisfaction with this product led me to obtain a copy of this latest Trend product. I haven't been disappointed in the least. Right from the beginning, this software product proves its usefulness, starting with the quick installation. The software installs so quickly you wonder if something wasn't done correctly or if you missed a step. But it really is that fast and it goes to work immediately, pretecting against threats and providing much needed peace of mind.

I have used a few other security software products in the past and many have proven acceptable, but still had their annoyances and the chief one is the tendency of many security software products to slow down your computer. Trend security software doesn't cause this problem. My computer runs as fast as normal and if I didn't know it, I wouldn't even guess that security software was installed at all. Another annoyance is pop- up reminders. Now, I realize that some individuals like these reminders because they consider them an extra layer of protection. But I would rather not see the reminders to check for threats and just remember to click the appropriate link and view them when I want to. Trend spares you the constant reminders while protecting your computer they way you want to be protected.

Another area where Trend Micro shines is with parental controls. My girls are young but they are slowly developing an interest in computers and I feel much better knowing that my Trend parental settings are in place, protecting against the possibility that one of my kids will link into the wrong site. And I like that Trend offers so many different levels of child protection. This allows a parent to select the appropriate level for the age of the child.

Internet security software is critical and Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security is one of the best security protection software products I have ever used. Quick loading, quiet background operation, no slowdowns, and full protection make this a software product that earns an easy stamp of approval.",Trend Micro Titanium Offers Quiet Protection,1298937600,3,

I edit a consumer technology website so I feel very comfortable reviewing this product. Unfortunately, I can't give Microsoft Streets and Trips more than a lukewarm recommendation.

Let's start with the installation of the the software. The installer program on the included DVD-ROM is easily confused by other startup applications ... so don't try to install this software until all of your Windows startup applications (antivirus, wireless assistants, etc.) have finished loading. Even a single background application can throw off the installation.

Once installed, the trip planning software works fine, but you can do the same thing faster, easier, and for free using Google Maps or Yahoo Maps online. The overall Streets and Trips software interface isn't very intuitive so expect to stumble around trying to figure out how it works the first few times you try to use it.

Once you're able to get the GPS receiver to lock onto satellites and provide directions, things don't get much better. The spoken turn-by-turn directions aren't always clear, and because of the weak GPS receiver (more on that later) you don't always get the verbal directions when you need them.

The included GPS receiver/USB dongle is large but doesn't provide very good reception. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio (a reasonably large US city) and half the time I cannot get the GPS receiver to lock onto a satellite. My Garmin nuvi 360 handheld GPS gets better satellite reception, is easier to use, and the spoken directions are easier to understand. The only major advantage to The Microsoft Streets and Trips software/GPS receiver combo is that you can install it on a laptop so you don't have to carry a laptop and a GPS when traveling ... you can just use your laptop. Of course, that's assuming the GPS receiver actually gets a signal and can provide turn-by-turn directions.

The software supposedly gets updates for traffic conditions, but it never seems to know when there's a major construction zone ahead ... even if it's a construction zone that has been there for several months. By comparison, my Garmin GPS almost always knows when I'm about to approach a construction zone and alerts me in advance.

Bottom line, I really can't recommend Microsoft Streets and Trips 2009 with GPS to anyone unless you can't afford a stand-alone GPS device or smartphone with built-in GPS. Yes, I suppose it's nice to be able to navigate using just your laptop in the car, but the weak GPS receiver sort of kills that benefit.","When it works it's OK, but might not be worth the money.",1247702400,4,

You can draw with it, retouch photos, and it includes tools that aid you in making your photos look like paintings with a minimum of time and effort.

The attached video briefly shows what Roxio's NXT 4 can do by simply going through the high level menus. As a bonus, the video illustrates what you get using Roxio's 'Record Your Screen"" feature. I find it to be a very useful capability because it captures anything that's on your primary or secondary monitor, both video and sound and you can see the quality for yourself if you expand the attached video to 'full screen'. Just for fun, toward the end I am playing a previous screen recording session within the main recording.

________________________________________________________

Roxio was very much 'love at first sight' to me, back in the early 2000's. Even then, it managed to consolidate a number of 'media' functions into one package and it was great for as long as one's expectations were for decent, basic capabilities. Then, as the company was bought and sold, subsequent versions turned increasingly bloated, slow and bug-infested and were backed by unacceptable customer support. The last 2-3 installment were bad to the point that they wouldn't even install on my Windows 7 computers and barely worked on one of my kid's Windows 8 and so-called customer service was unable to do anything about it. I did review them at Amazon and they got well-deserved 1-star ratings.

Well... here's the good news, the NXT 4 works, in the sense that it actually installed without a glitch on my Windows 7, the interface is super-clean, well integrated and efficient and everything I've tried so far works exactly as expected.

Roxio NXT is a Jack-of-all-trades by design so anyone who expects Photoshop-like sophistication when editing photos is going to be disappointed. However, whatever I tried so far worked well and did for me what I expected. I didn't try 'everything' because, as the attached video shows, there's a lot in NXT but the features that interested me the most are just great. So let me give you a couple of examples.

""Capture Audio from Sound Card"", for example, would let me play some music on my computer and it's intelligent enough to determine when the song ends, then check the recording against some giant database and, if recognized, it will properly file it under the correct album, artist and song title. I works near 100% of the time for as long as you have some decent source for your music, like a music service. And, if your service has commercials, it's okay because you can set it to ignore anything that's shorter than, let's say, 35 seconds. There are many options, including 'quality' and the audio file format, even a setting to 'not record' a song if it already exists in your library. To make it short, this feature alone would make this a worthy purchase for me.

""Record Your Screen"" is what I used for the attached video. It takes everything you have on your screen and whatever sound your computer 'hears' and it dumps it all into a WMV file. Please watch the video to get an idea of 'everything' that Roxio can do. I begin the recording by simply browsing through its features. The second half were, among other things, I recorded me playing a recording of my recording my screen may not be as interesting. Note that I am using the Windows Media Player rather than Roxio's own Nero to play this because, as I noted before, Roxio's NXT 4 has 'a lot' but I do prefer other apps to perform certain specific activities and Nero's media player is far from may player favorites.

Without going any more in-depth, I would say that this version of Roxio's NXT is worth its price, even considering the reasonable likelihood of dismal customer support for which Corel, the owner of Roxio is famous. I suspect that there are other apps that can capture and properly file music. In fact I did try one or two but none, as far as I know, is as efficient and elegant as Roxio's. Same for screen capture. It's totally agnostic of 'what' it is on the screen and that makes it flexible and efficient. I also like its ability to quickly autofix large numbers (as in hundreds or thousands) of photos at once. And, since the NXT actually installed on my computer, I am happy with it and I will rate it a 4 stars, one star being deducted for Corel's terrible customer support of which I was a victim in the past.

My advice would be: just forget who makes this. I can't say much about the ""Data Copy"" section because I don't need Roxio for it so see other reviews discussing it but the Music, Video and Photo sections should make NXT a worthy app.",On Path to Decent?,1455753600,,

While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.

My recommendation is that you save some money and start with this or Deluxe. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done.

This product got me started and greatly reduced legal fees.  I knew I wanted a living trust and wanted a lawyer involved but dreaded the expense.  By using this product to become informed about all the questions and forms, I was able to prepare my will and a framework for the trust which I can now take to a lawyer for verification and filing for a fraction of the cost of going in cold. The product produces the appropriate documents which you can have notarized and will serve the legal need, but for something this important I wanted to spare my kids any issues by having everything reviewed and officially verified.

We used a Living Trust for my mother which worked really well for her and then for us following her death which kept the disposition of her effects, sale of her house, etc., as painless as possible in a state where the estate laws are onerous. It encouraged me to do the same for my kids.

I'd been avoiding the process until I bought this product which got me started.  In the box is the software CD and a book, but it is not an instruction manual.  It is 'The Legal Answer Book for Families' and includes the topics: adoption, child custody, domestic partnerships, teenagers, elder care, marriage, name change, tax breaks and divorce with free updates on the Nolo website.  The product user manual is a pdf file included in the software so an internet connection is not required to access it.

The product installed easily on my Win7 PC and offered a free download of updates but upon reading the items included in the update, I didn't bother as they didn't apply to me.  The software starts with a short movie which I found useful and informative.  It is laid out well and very easy to use. There are five sections which can be tackled separately.  They are: Will, Health Care Directive, Durable Power of Attorney for Finances, Final Arrangements and Information for Caregivers and Survivors.  The documents created are listed under each topic as you create them and you can easily return to any one to review or change it.

There is plenty of help along the way, including a checklist of items to gather before starting each section.  This is precisely why I wanted to use such a product before involving a lawyer.  Having all this thought out in advance and recorded is well worth the cost of the software.

That was necessitated by Intuit's (the manufacturer) decision not to allow preparation of Schedule E (royalty & rental income) forms with the Deluxe version, like I could in the past. That coupled with the incessant push to make you file electronically through TurboTax (for an additional fee), made this version of TurboTax MUCH less pleasant or easy to use.

3576,3576,4.0,True,"09 4, 2009",A23GFTVIETX7DS,B001AMPP0W,,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"I hesitated before purchasing Snow Leopard since I know new operating systems can wreck your computing environment, but the Apple OS upgrades have always served me well, so I went for it.  The installation took about an hour on my Mac Mini.  Perhaps tellingly, I couldn't tell right away that my computer was running a different operating system.  All my settings, dock, programs looked exactly the same.  Only after using it was I able to begin to see what had changed.  NOTE:  I currently have this installed on my Mac Mini only.  I want to wait several months before converting all my Macs to Snow Leopard.

The Good:

-- Start up and shut down is, as promised, faster.  Likewise, Safari is much faster than even the newest update installed on Leopard.  Most other programs run faster as well.  These speed differences are noticeable, so, if you are at all impatient, you might want to upgrade for this alone.
-- Microsoft Office 2004 AND 2008 both work as they did before the upgrade.  I use these programs frequently, and the fear that they wouldn't be compatible almost steered me away from Snow Leopard
-- Time Machine seems to be much more stable in Snow Leopard, and this is perhaps the biggest plus of upgrading.
-- Snow Leopard includes X-Code tools for developers.  I don't use these, so I can't comment except that they exist.
-- Expos is a wonderful tool once put in the Dock, although not all users will need or want this access.
-- Computers that currently run Tiger can upgrade, thus skipping an entire OS (Leopard).  If you haven't used Leopard, you'll notice a huge difference.
-- So far, I have not had any compatibility issues with the applications I use.  Adobe Photoshop Elements requires the installation of Rosetta, one of the optional elements, but, if you don't download it initially, the computer will prompt you to install.
-- The family pack can be installed on five computers, without having to enter long codes.  If you have two or more Macs, the price per machine is quite reasonable.

The Bad:

-- At first, I couldn't install because I didn't have enough space on the hard drive for Snow Leopard because of the presence of Leopard.  I had to get rid of some old videos and unwanted photos to make room.  Once installed, I had the space available to me again.  People who have lots of media on their computers will have a tougher time than those that have less content.
-- The difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard are small enough to make this a desirable but not necessary upgrade.  The difference is not dramatic -- not at all like the leap between Tiger and Leopard.  You'll have to weigh the cost against the benefits.
-- The claims of ""greater stability"" are difficult to test since the original Leopard is pretty darn stable on its own.

Because Snow Leopard is not a step backward, I recommend getting it if you plan to keep your current Mac for a while since future tweaks are often dependent on running the latest operating system.  Likewise, if you have a Mac purchased just before the release of Snow Leopard, you should take advantage of the ten dollar upgrade before it disappears.  Except for those who still run Tiger,other Mac owners will not miss much in this latest OS X.

But I have been using Norton Antivirus for several years, and McAfee's online ratings aren't much better, so -- I purchased this product online.  There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted (Norton Internet Security Professional) and also the standard (non-Pro) version I didn't want.  The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the ""download warranty"" that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.

But no, I was charged for all four products, including the two that aren't products at all.
The run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL, and apparently the download warranties CAN'T be refunded.  I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?  If so, what about all that support they're promising, if they go down?
Next issue: within a few minutes of installing the software, Norton blocked and reported an attempted access from the Internet, called ""Default Block NetBus Trojan Horse"".  Great, that's what I was hoping to prevent.  BUT: what was that all about?  How do I know who was doing it and who do I tell, in order to get somebody put in jail?

PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.

Pros:

Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.

Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)

The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.

Cons:

The sharpen slider in the Quickfix studio works in chunks rather than in a linear fashion - 0,50 etc.  You must type in a sharpen amount in the box next to the slider and then sharpen in a linear fashion - 28,29,30,31 etc.  Serif verified this bug in Sept 08.

The makeover studio requires several steps similar to Adobe Photoshop - creation of editing masks.  Paintshop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate thankfully does not require the creation of masks to do makeover tasks.

What's the difference and why is it important? Allow me to explain:

A subscription is like a lease. You pay a set amount of money either monthly or for one year and gain access to something (an apartment, a piece of software) and may use it for the agreed upon amount of time. Once the lease (or the subscription) is terminated, you LOSE your right to use said item. That might be fine for apartments, but much less so for software. You are beholden to the company that created the software forever. If they decide to STOP making the software, you lose your data, and even more importantly, your ability to access and use your previously collected data. Or at least you might, and that's a huge risk for something like accounting data. You might be stuck manually entering years worth of data by hand from printed reports (assuming you have them all).

When you purchase something, you have several protected rights. One is the right to use what you purchased however you like and for as long as you like (fair use). You also have the right to sell that thing to someone else (First Sale doctrine). With a subscription you have neither of those things, and the lease or subscription holder can take your ability to use the software away from you any time they like. Perhaps they won't, but its an undeniable factor that must be taken into account.

All that said, SAGE and QUICKBOOKS use the same model, so you're not really going to have much choice but to have a subscription if you want a professional accounting software. That's sad, but true.

The weird thing was that if you start the install by disc, you have to keep the disc in even if you select to download the most recent software from the website.  Once it started doing the download, I tried removing the disc figuring it shouldn't need it any longer.  It then got hung up waiting for me to put the disc back in.

Meanwhile, I initiated the install on the laptop by going to the URL provided on the registration key's card.  This was actually a more straightforward process as you log in to your account, enter the registration key, then it basically does the install.

The weird thing, though is that once finished, my desktop only shows that I've installed it on 1 pc.  Oh well, they're both protected.

I don't really like the user interface, as it just seems like you can't actually customize what components are turned on/off very easily, nor are there many customization options.

Our PC was also very slow after installation.  I turned off the site advisor add-ons that are supposed to protect against bogus websites and this has seemed to help to some degree, but other non-browser programs also seem to be slow to load on occasion as well.

The packages include so many protection programs, it's just hard to know what all it's doing, and with the user interface that doesn't really give you many details or options, it's hard to figure out what parts you really need and which are just superfluous.

One day, maybe these programs will actually track and tell you the lag they create by having to pre-scan files, websites and disc activity.  While this might protect you, it also slows you down.

There are two methods of which to build your family tree; desktop and online. I found the online method to be a lot easier to work with and move around in.

As of December 2010 the announcement is official that the newer version will completely eliminate (and by this I mean ""break"") the way hard drives are managed in the current version.  What this means to you is that if you purchase this version of the Windows Home Server OS, you will be headed for a dead-end if your Windows Home Server hardware does not have its own RAID controller.  There are other workarounds for the issue, but those that I have seen thus far are complicated.  If you are looking at purchasing Windows Home Server, you might want to hold off until the new version comes out, or else commit yourself to staying with this version.

NOTE:  This product has gone far beyond the item listed here and is, as of 12/2009, up to ""Power Pack 3"".  If you cannot find a newer release of this product, make it a point immediately after installation to allow the Server to update itself before trying to properly set up the rest of your Windows Home Server.  It will save you a lot of trouble if you do this because the updates resolve a lot of issues.  Most importantly, Power Pack 3 adds compatibility with Windows 7 and fixes some serious problems with file indexing.

Windows Home Server (or ""WHS"") seems to serve two purposes:

1) to provide a very simple way of doing every useful ""home network"" type of task without having to know much about servers

2) to prevent anyone who is not a home user from trying to use the OS as any sort of formal Windows Server (such as for a business or as a web server)

This means that if you come from a background of managing servers and are used to managing things at the OS level, you really need to let that go. Things that seem like a can't-fail performance tweak or a standard ""best practice"" will actually destabilize Windows Home Server and eventually lead you off to rebuild-land, wondering how things went wrong.  Remoting into a Windows Home Server using anything besides the Windows Home Server Console will corrupt the installation and cause problems (more on this in a moment), once again leading you to rebuild.  This is a case where when Microsoft says, ""We don't support you doing that,"" they mean it.

The good news is, if you want to have your own server at home and you want it to be hassle-free, Windows Home Server will fit your needs.  99% of the tasks you perform are all in one place:  the Windows Home Server Console.  This rich graphical interface drives everything you'll do in managing and configuring your server.  It simplifies tasks and provides quick at-a-glance information on your server's status.

So what are some of those features?

Backup and mirroring:  Windows Home Server will enable you to back up your home computers to it.  These backups update themselves on a schedule that you set and can later be used to restore the machine if things go wrong.  Instead of using RAID for disk redundancy, Windows Home Server uses a technology called ""folder duplication.""  It seems bizarre to omit RAID from a server that's supposed to keep redundant copies, but here in Windows Home Server, it really is better suited to the OS' design.  It is also closely customizeable, allowing you to specifically set which folders should be duplicated for data protection.

Disk management:  it's easy to add or remove extra drives.  WHS uses drive letter mapping to make all volumes the ""D:\"" drive.  This drive letter is a logical mapping off the root physical volume, and your C:\ drive is deliberately limited to a much smaller volume in order to make restoring the server a snap on those hopefully-rare occasions when you have to.  Storage is balanced across volumes automatically and while watching it happen on my MediaSmart Ex495 I rarely see it impact performance.

Media sharing and streaming:  Using simple ""Music, Photos, Videos"" categories, you can control how to share media and also enable or disable streaming.  You can also enable/disable integration with Windows Media Center. Windows Media Center on your PCs will easily pick up on the existence of the server and walk you through installation of the plug-in once you have enabled this feature.  I found WMC integration to really be dirt-simple to set up and useful to have on all my machines, and I'm betting it integrates really well with an X-Box 360 as well.  I've used it with my Playstation 3 and it's been very easy to access through the PS3's Media Bar (or ""XMB"").  There are also the Firefly Server (which I have not used closely) and TwonkyMedia, which provides an alternative way of managing and streaming your content.  Last, there is iTunes functionality but I have not used this feature (there are many, MANY forums that can help you with this if you'd like to learn more).

The hard part of Windows Home Server is recognizing that it is best used on its own terms:  use the Windows Home Server Console to access the server and its settings, use the Windows Home Server Toolkit to do deeper ""expert"" tasks (and try to avoid doing these unless you have to), and most importantly do not remote into the box.  Windows Home Server carefully manages the installation and configuration of software, and accessing these programs from outside the console can cause problems.  More importantly, Microsoft's Windows Update pushes updates based on the machine's server core.  Windows Home Server uses Server 2003 as its core.  In plain English this means that Windows Home Server appears to Microsoft Update as if it's a Server 2003 box.  When the Console controls the updates, it is capable of filtering out the Server 2003 updates that are intended for WHS and those that aren't.  Remoting into the box will cause Windows Update to call and answer with the full list and add updates to the queue that WHS really shouldn't have.  Which is to say nothing of the default behavior of Remote Desktop Connection, which is to assume you want to share resources (such as printers, faxes, scanners on the network) with your remote session and try to install the drivers on the server while you're connected.

If you want a simple home media server, Windows Home Server will provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-manage, self-maintaining way to do it.  However, you have to work within its rules and you need to be willing to let go of the lower-level things a typical Server administrator will do.  If you want a robust and configurable server machine that allows you to customize to your heart's content, you may not be happy with the loss of control WHS requires.  You might consider just installing your own server and being done with it.",Best if Used on its Own Terms,1267142400,10,

The reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 (the first time I've done that with this series) is because there are several places where what you have to do to move on is illogical, and for these same areas, there isn't any hints to let you know what to do.  As a result, I wound up having to consult ""UHS Hints"" (a really good website where you can find hints to all the Nancy Drew games) a lot more than I would have liked...

""Shadow Ranch"" is situated in the Arizona Desert - and the graphics of this area are great!  The mystery surrounds strange happenings that are occuring on the ranch - such as a phantom horse riding through at night, always accompanied by a major mishap at the ranch (a snake bite, power lines become downed, pump house floods).

Nancy finds out early in the game that there are rumors about an old bank robber who had hidden a treasure for his sweetheart - who used to live at the ranch.  So your job, as Nancy Drew, teen detective, is to 1. find out who or what is behind all of the strange mishaps - are they linked to the phantom horse, or does it just appear that way?  And 2. find the treasure - if there is one...

In order to get around the desert, you get to ride a horse - be sure to look around at everything you can find about riding horses before you begin, or you just might find yourself falling off a lot!!!

Overall, I found this game to be fun to play, although it did become quite frustrating at times...  If you find yourself having difficulty as I did, I'd recommend going to the ""UHS hints"" website - they allow you to choose how many hints to take, and you can always get a few before you're given the full answer - this way, if you just need a push in the right direction, you don't have to see the full answer and ruin the fun of figuring out for yourself.",Another Good Game!,1134864000,13,

Without this, I would need to convert my files in Final Cut Express as I take them off of the camcorder.  With it, I can just drag the .mts files onto an external hard drive and only convert them as I need them.

It converts the video just fine, but the audio is out-of-sync with the video, lagging behind by a few frames to begin with and getting progressively worse for long clips.

I've tried everything I could think of to fix the problem, including an uninstall and a reinstall.  No dice.  (But see UPDATE below).

So I emailed customer service - you CAN call them but a 15 minute call costs [...] bucks, even if they don't resolve the issue for you!  No thanks.  So I emailed them, stated my problem clearly, that I was working on a Mac and they responded with some fix for a different Windows video player that Roxio sells, for a problem completely unrelated to mine.  So I emailed them back, and they told me to uninstall and reinstall and then upgrade (once again).  A couple of hours later, having done that, I tried to convert a file and the same problem recurred.  So I emailed them again, and in the email mentioned that I'm on Snow Leopard and they pointed me to a link that mentioned there is currently a problem with their TIVO support for Snow Leopard.  In fact, I'd already seen that link when I was researching the problem (and also seen that I'm not alone in having this problem and that others report it on different Mac operating systems as well).  As far as I can tell, the ""customer care"" associates I've been corresponding with are really just a computerized search engine that picks a few random words from the query and sends back a ""solution""  that can be associated with that query.  I'd do better with Google than with Roxio's ""customer care.""

UPDATE (12/18/09): Now, several months and a few upgrades later, Toast is finally working like it's supposed to.  With version 10.5 the audio no longer lags behind the video.  I had purchased Voltaic HD online to fix the problem, and it did fix it, but unfortunately Voltaic is a lot slower than Toast and I don't see a major difference in quality.  Now with version 10.0.5, things seem to be working fine, and it is very fast.

The program runs okay, but seems a tad on the sluggish side, even on an i7 processor  with hyper-threading and 6 gig of ram.

This seems to be Cyberlink's answer to Adobe Lightroom, which I use extensively for all my NEF (RAW) photo processing, cataloging, and publishing. In that respect, I admit a fair amount of bias towards Lightroom as it is what I'm well versed in using and used to using on a daily basis. For someone who has never used Lightroom, Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultra is a viable alternative that is well worth consideration. It is very easy to use and you can get very similar end results using either one.

The only issues with Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultra I've run across is how it specifically handles NEF files from my D300 and D610. There is slightly more noticeable color banding than what Lightroom gives, and significantly more than what Nikon's own Capture NX-D software gives. I would also give the Nikon Capture NX-D software the edge in noise reduction.

Here's the thing though, this is a 3rd party software no matter what brand camera you use. In the case of Nikon DSLR's, any of the advanced in-camera settings you use such as Active D-Lighting, lens correction profiles, long-exposure noise reduction and so-forth are completely ignored by anything but Nikon's own proprietary software. You can emulate some of those things in post-processing, but not all of them. One must take this into account when choosing what to edit your raw files with, if for no other reason than time and convenience.

1) Enhanced email templates that are more customizable with client information and multiple attachments for QuickBooks generated emails.
2) Income tracker which makes it easier to track business income and overdue invoices.
3) Tracking bounced checks and more pre-defined one-click shortcuts for common tasks.

All three of these are nice. In my consulting business the Income Tracker is most immediately helpful. I expect the email customization enhancements will get me using direct QuickBooks email for my invoicing.

The included enhanced payroll is for one employee only. I was expecting what had once been up to 3 employees, so this is a disappointment. Unless you are a one person business, expect to spend more for more employees' payroll! The enhanced payroll is very nice as it will electronically submit federal forms for you. For me this is time and postage saver and is very easy to do. The payroll service includes updates when rules change for state or federal regulations. These updates include rule changes for how the program processes payroll and very clear explanations and directions for the person handling payroll if any manual action is needed. If you want to keep payroll in-house Quickbooks Payroll is a good option.

The program installed without issues on Windows 7 Pro 64bit. The biggest issue is remembering my intuit login which is required for registration. It should be noted that updating QuickBooks should be one of the first steps with installation. This can take several minutes. It's only November 2013 and we are already up to the R3 update. I like that QuickBooks aggressively updates the product to keep it up to date.

In the past three alone, they've gone from containing great plots with terrible gaming quality (Secrets Can Kill) to awesome plots with incredible gaming quality (Message in a Haunted Mansion). Treasure in the Royal Tower is no exception, and definitely the best Nancy Drew game to the date of its release.

Nancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickford's historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover what's going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. It's now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...

This is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Tower's release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Marie's character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her (""fictional"" meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isn't all that scary, but since the past three were, it's good to have one in which the scare factor was a little ""toned down"" (if they were all scary, then it'd get boring after awhile).

Like the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but they're very well-integrated into the game and don't get in the way of sleuthing. Nancy actually spends the vast majority of the game sneaking into hidden passageways, questioning suspects, and looking through confidential areas.

While the graphics do show their age on occasion, they're absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancy's exploration). I won't say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.

The cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castle's elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than he's admitting. He's currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that she'd like to explore Marie's tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle who's currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her ""theory"" (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).

Like the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprit's character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.

The game's musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall ""castle"" feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically ""royal"", for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isn't fast enough to find a way out. There wasn't a track out of place, if you ask me.

While the previous game is a close runner-up, ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" was definitely the best Nancy Drew game at the time of its release. Some would even say that it's still the best to date, and it remains in the top three as of the release of the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites packaging (along with ""The Secret of Shadow Ranch"" and ""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"". Between the rich sense of history, awesome casting, wonderfully detailed settings, and great soundtrack, this surely remains one of Nan's most memorable cases to date.

All of this is done with the mouse, meaning gameplay is both simple and complex at the same time. Simple to make things happen, but complex to solve the increasing difficulty of the levels.

Capture cards typically came bundled with software for capturing, editing and producing video in DVD and other formats. The most common ones at the time were Pinnacle Studio and Ulead Video Studio. Ulead is now part of Corel, and is sold as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-VideoStudio/dp/B00BFYEH8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel VideoStudio</a>. That product has evolved quite a bit, and is still a good choice. I reviewed it separately as part of Corel Photo Video Suite X6. Pinnacle evolved quite a bit too, and this version is a departure from previous versions. I never used version 16, but compared to version 15 and below, this version has a substantially different interface. Its old one was centered around the paradigm of the steps mentioned above, which was common for Video Studio and also for Cyberlink Power Director. Others such as Sony took a fresh approach, and this is a fresh approach for Pinnacle.

The new interface is cleaner and more powerful. I can now edit far more video tracks, rendering is much faster, and many features have been added. Unfortunately, while video editing software seemed to be the last software product around that still came with a hard copy manual, Corel has dropped it for both this and Video Studio. I suppose if you have a Kindle, you can get by with the PDF, but you most likely want your full computer screen for running the product itself. I found the PDF manual to be lacking, and some very simple things are not documented. Thus the learning curve was greater than I expected, even though once I learned it, it was easy to use.

The newest features are useful and practical, but there is also an increasing array of features that go far beyond what I'll ever need. In past versions, I often failed to see why I need hundreds of new transitions and more title backgrounds than I'd care to look at when I'll only use a handful, but if you are looking for a special title slide or want to have effects similar to the wipes, fades, pans, folds and spins of an over the top sports broadcast, you can do that too.

The product is still well suited for getting those old Digital8 or MiniDV tapes off the shelf and putting them on line, but it's even better suited to giving you the features necessary to work with your full HD videos and render things in any popular format or burn to a Blu-ray disc. It will also handle 3D videos. It won't handle subtitles the way Cyberlink will and you'd have to rely on standard titles for that. But the interface is much cleaner than something like Cyberlink's, which tries to upsell itself.

I've found it particularly useful when multiple video cameras are used at the same event and I wish to cut from one angle to another but have a cohesive video with no breaks in action or dialog. But the same editing capabilities come in handy even with lesser quality video, and my video review shows how I was able to salvage bits and pieces of videos to come up with something better.

Whether you merely want to take a collection of video clips and put them together, adding transitions and little more, or whether you want to edit multiple videos together with fancy titles rolling credits and Blu-Ray disc menus with a different moving background for each scene selection, you can do it with this product. The PLUS version of the product doesn't have all the features of the Ultimate version, so I suggest you check the feature comparison chart. I suspect that for most users, this will work fine, especially if you save your videos on your computer or want to watch them on line. If you want to burn things to Blu-Ray disc or want support for 4K ultra HD, the Ultimate version will be better for you.",Powerful but a lot to learn,1392854400,,

I have a long history with this product, going back to its days as Ulead's video editor. It was flaky then, stayed flaky in the occasional upgrade I've purchased and remains flaky in this most recent version.

  I needed an inexpensive video editor for another computer and I am up to my license limit on the other packages I own and my earlier VideoStudio packages are not Windows 7 compatible. This is certainly cheap enough, but true to its own traditions, it is not ready for prime time.

  For example, I tried to open two MP4 files created with the ArcSoft video product. Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 gave me a file mismatch error. However, Apple QuickTime, Avid Studio, Adobe Premiere Pro, Cyberlink PowerDirector 10, Avif Pinnacle 14 HD and Windows Movie Maker opened the MP4 files without difficulty. I noted in Corel's support forum that there are many reported problems identical or closely similar to mine. To me, that means sloppy coding and inadequate beta-testing and quality control, the same problems that have plagued Ulead/Corel problems for years. Oddly enough, Video studio Pro X4 would open other MP4 files created with the ArcSoft product.

  Next, I wanted to record from a DV source. Video Studio Pro X4 recognized the source, played the audio but would not display a preview of the video. I finally got it to work, but don't ask me how. The problem occurred on numerous occasion making VideoStudio very difficult to record with.

  I don't know what other unpleasant surprises are in store for me with Corel Video studio Pro X4, but based on past experience, there will be no shortage of them. On the other hand, the product is cheap - in more than just price - and this particular need doesn't require much more than the minimal capabilities.

  Overall, my initial impressions are negative. Should further experience change my opinion, I will amend my review. My advice though is that unless you absolutely can't afford a better video editing product, avoid Corel Video Studio Pro X4.

  I continued working with VideoStudio for another day and my impression has now solidified: it stinks.

  Repeated difficulties connecting to a known good DV device. Crashes so severely that the Windows 7 computer it was hosted on required a reboot. Usability is low with basic editing commands buried deep in the manual. Single frame key shortcuts, for example, are buried in the manual instead of in tooltips.

  My opinion: Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 is to be avoided.

Lots of features, extras, and massive platform to do almost any home or semi-pro project. The problems with previous Pinnacle is the lack of multithread and 64 bit integration, and choppy rendering during the editing process. The Pinnacle 18 has 64 bit architecture and utilizes your computer's juice to it's fullest potential.

Installation - Took far too long. 30 minutes for installation in this optimized day in age? A non-factor, but something worth noting.

Interface-  Intuitive, easy to drag and drop, cut, selecting frames.

Rending Capability - While it is built for CUDA (Nvidia Graphics cards), my AMD Radeon card still was able to lend some juice to rendering.

Editing - Drag and drop, snip snip, import video. Relatively easy to pick up. Not being able to just drag a video from the outside is annoying. I have to import the video into the Pinnacle ecosystem before playing with it. The editing tool for video is superb. Change lighting, exposure, overlay image or text - this is like photoshop/lightroom for video editing.

Live Screen Capture - Simply a win. No more searching for that right screen capture software. Integrated, easy to use, spectacular convenience.

What I love is that recording both the video and audio (program sounds) is seamless. Not many recording programs provide this feature. Usually, you would need to use an external recording device to overlay any audio.

Features and extras - My golly. Royalty free soundtracks, endless list of transitions and effects, countless plugins. I personally don't need them all, but you will probably find a diamond in the bucket. It can be quite a headache to surf through all those transitions and effects. Look through them all thoroughly a couple times, bookmark your favorites, and save yourself time in your video editing regime.

The Pinnacle Studio 18 jumped leaps in and bounds and showed promise with the revamped 64 bit architecture and usual plethora of features. It is far from perfect, but it does give you all the tools for home or semi-pro production. If you want to cut the crap (plugins, extras), and you do like the Pinnacle Studio's ease of use, already solid collection of transitions and effects, go with the Pinnacle regular or plus versions.

Jaguar is the latest release of OS X. A true multitasking operating system based on UNIX. Yes, there is a REAL version of UNIX under the hood and the hackers among you will drool over the possibilities. Apple is beginning to take advantage of the superior hardware design capabilities of the Mac with OS X.
The best part, OS X hides the UNIX underpinnings in a superior Graphical User Interface (known as Aqua.) So, if you know nothing about UNIX, don't worry, you don't have to know UNIX to use a Mac. Ease of use has been the hallmark of Macs since their introduction back in 1984.
You have the ability to create a true multi-user enviornment. Multiple userids, multiple processes running simultaneously and protected memory. This means if you have a program crash, only the one program will crash, everything else keeps going and going and going. (Sorry Energizer Bunny, I couldn't resist.)
If you are a UNIX lover, Apple provides the Terminal application which gives you full access to the UNIX kernel system.
If you are among the long-time Mac user community, you may have come to love the capabilities of OS 9 (or 8 or earlier.) Some Macs still have the ability to boot into either OS 9 or OS X. Newer Macs only allow OS X booting. If you still have programs from the days when you could boot into OS 9, you can still run many of them in ""Classic"" environment. Classic is an emulator, running on OS X to allow you to still run older programs requiring the older OS. Admittedly, there are programs that won't work in Classic. Mostly programs needing custom-made extensions or Control Panels may not load. Also, most of the still-existing software companies are creating native OS X versions of their programs.
If you insist on running Windows XP or 2000 or 98 or 95 or DOS, you even have the option of running Virtual PC (which, by the way, is now owned by Microsoft - think about that for a moment.)
There is also a Mac version of Microsoft's Office Suite. This allows you to exchange documents with your PC counterparts, seamlessly.
Macs have superior video capabilities and OS X takes full advantage of this.
OS X has some superior software to go along for the ride - iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto and iTunes, to name a few. These are all free.
With OS X, Mac users will be leaving others in the dust.

I note this as two people asked me about ZIP files in the last couple months. So much for the brief history lesson.

It makes fast work of converting Microsoft Word docs (and other Office files) to PDF format, and it's easy to create them as read-only PDF if you want to avoid file alteration by other parties.

It has been redesigned to support new add-ons, and cloud navigation makes it simpler to protect, manage and share your files online. An updated Zip engine makes even smaller ZIP and Zipx files.

Now you can display photos within ZIP files without extracting them by using WinZip's internal image viewer, and you can use the 'Photos' button to rapidly transfer photos from supported cameras and iPhones, then rotate and compress them into picture shows for sharing. Among the new features, you can use direct access to cloud services. These include Google Drive, SkyDrive (now Cloud Drive), and Dropbox, which I've tried successfully. You can also access other cloud services such as  Box, CloudMe and SugarSync, though I have not tried these. You can also send links to your cloud files via instant messaging, email and social media with the Cloud Links feature.

If you have a large number of digital images on your hard drive, it will reduce your .JPG files by about 20 to 25% with no loss of photo quality or data integrity. Photographers with a large number of images should note that WinZip may (or may not) cause some issues with image management/viewing applications such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom or Nikon ViewNX 2, so run some tests before you try to compress all of your images. I have not tried compressing RAW images, as keeping them intact is a personal thing.

In fact, WordPerfect and Quattro Pro were among the very first applications that I learned (yes, I'm an old timer). Learning to use them anew is like riding a bicycle: no problem at all. I suspect that new users will find them to be very intuitive, too.

One of the attributes of X8 is interchangeability with Microsoft file formats. However, even after I had downloaded the compatibility add-on I found that the conversion process between formats was not 100 percent between WordPerfect and Word. (Perhaps I still have a few tricks to learn so it would be wrong for me to claim authority on this issue, but it seems slightly problematic.) For that reason, I hesitate to recommend X8 if the purpose is to edit files from work if your workplace uses Microsoft products.

In my opinion, X8 is probably best suited for users who are mostly interested in creating great documents but are less interested in collaboration with Microsoft users. I think that includes a lot of people - myself included!

--------------------
While I am still behind the general approach to this software, unfortunately, after making it quite a ways into the software, I have decided that the technical implementation--particularly around voice recognition--is so unbelievably poor as to make the software unusable.

Here are the big problems.

1. The voice recognition component is worthless.  At times even the most simple word (I can certainly pronounce ""drei"" in German) fails to recognize the word.  For fun--and to prove the point--go into the mode where you can repeat the word as often as you want and get an analysis of what you did right or wrong.  You can repeat a single, simple syllable over and over and watch the analysis be completely different every time.  The important part to notice is that it does not register a ""fail"" (as in, ""you said it wrong""); it simply does not take input from the microphone.  It registers an ""I did not hear you"" sound, and no amount of begging will convince it you are speaking.  At other times, I have discovered that the only way to get something ""right"" is to intentionally pronounce something wrongly--for example, anything like ""Ich"", ""Spreche"", etc. with a ""ch"" has a far better chance of success if pronounced as an English ""sh"" (as in ""she"", ""shy"") rather than the correct sound.

2. The Support is HORRIBLE.  When I contacted them to discuss the problemsabove, they told me (rather sarcastically) that I was simply not saying the phrase correctly.  This was ironic from ""Bob"", who clearly someone in need of ""Rosetta Stone for Residents of Bangalore"".  To illustrate that I am not completely incapable of repeating a very basic sound, I recorded the voice of the Rosetta Stone native speaker and played it back to the program.  It was wrong over 80% of the time.  When I pointed this out, the support organization then suggested that it was perhaps a problem with the microphone, and transferred me to a different department to give me the privilege of buying another microphone from them (gee, thanks... $600 for this software and you want me to buy another microphone because by your own admission the microphone you included is broken?  that seems ummm... really...  reasonable).

3. Rather than purchase the oh-so-cheap microphone, I elected to purchase a very nice microphone from SoundBlaster.  This product works great--for every piece of software except Rosetta Stone, which continues to be unable to understand even the most basic phrases.  I then tried a rather nice Logitech--same results--great precision everywhere else and nothing in Rosetta Stone.

4. The most frustrating part of this is that some days, Rosetta Stone will work just fine.  I can go through lesson after lesson with perfect scores; then suddenly it simply decides to fail.  Occasionally a reboot will help, but generally just for a few minutes, then it is back to being horrible.

Overall, it is a shame that a piece of software that is otherwise quite a good way to introduce you to a new language is (a) so insanely bad in a critical product area, and (b) the company refuses to recognize the deficiency.  This software is never going to make anyone a fluent speaker--even with these problems fixed--but if I knew I were being dropped into German in three months, it would certainly be something I believe would prepare me to get by and build the base I needed for eventual fluency after living there for a few years.

I think that the bottom line is that if you are willing to skip all the speaking lessons, you might really enjoy and get value from this software, but I strongly suggest that you save yourself the frustration of dealing with the random God of Speech (Dis-)Recognition

------------END UPDATED REVIEW--------------

Rosetta Stone Version 3 is an excellent way to introduce someone to a new language.

SETUP
Reasonably easy, but I would strongly recommend an Internet connection during installation to get all the features unlocked.  I did the installation on an airplane, and found out that I was missing a few things.  This is easily remedied later.

COURSE CONTENT
Overall, the course content is very good, using only the German language--there is no use of English at all, except for menu options and such.  This is not, therefore, a course that relies at all on ""translation"".  Rather, the course uses images and audio to acquaint the user with key words and phrases, then re-enforces them by using them in different orders, combining them in different ways, etc. until the use becomes natural.

This is generally quite effective, but in some areas falls short.  For example, the intricacies of German articles (is it ""Der"", ""Das"", ""Die""?) can be a little tricky to pick up in this way--it would be nice to have at least some explanation of how these are used in a general sense, explaing how they are used with respect to gender and plurality.

An unfortunate feature is that the images appear to be very generic, as opposed to specifically related to the German culture.  I assume that this allows Rosetta to recycle these images for other languages, but it diminishes the quality of the immersion program, and is my reason for giving this product only four stars.  To truly learn a language, one must understand its culture as well, and having images that match that culture would greatly enhance the experience.

CONCLUSION
Other than the specific issues mentioned previously, this is an excellent product and I would recommend it over any other language training products I have encountered.",UPDATED:  Very good way to learn a language; shame about the implementation.,1229644800,4,

I would have liked this program a lot more if not for some weird issue with providing a simple ""Save"" or ""Save As"" function.

This can possibly cause disasters with working on a photo, and accidentally altering it without meaning to.

A lot of Microsoft staff was there. One quick note is that there were two types of staff. One wore red shirts, and the others wore blue shirts. The whole day seminar/presentation started with an explanation of, ""If you have a technical question, ask one of the Microsoft staff in a red shirt, if you have a sales or marketing question, ask a blue shirt"". I got a charge out of that. Sales people are enamored with what the software can do for you, and the technical staff is enamored in how it can do it.

What I really wanted to share with you is the major difference between W2000 and 98; In W2000 the system files are off bounds by different programs regarding, not being able to modify them for each program. In 98, that doesn't hold true. If a change needs to be made to a system file, then the outside software manufacturer can do it. The only help is that you can run system file checker in 98 to check for modified system files, and correct them.

What W2000 does is amazing. Not only can an outside manufacturer not be able to change system files, if you go in and delete a system file, then exit out of the folder, then go back in, sure enough the system file you just deleted was automatically restored when you exited out of the folder.

Another point I wanted to make; the overwhelming advantage of using W2000 over XP when installing in an older machine is that it is compatible with a lot of the older hardware.

  Here is the problem: You install XP, and up comes a warning that your hardware is not compatible, or needs drivers loaded in order to work. The manufacturers on the other hand, made your older component, whether it is a sound card, or video card, long before XP arrived, so they never created software drivers for it to run in XP. Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components. The advantage with W2000 is that you are getting the reliability, and the older hardware (within reason) compatibility.

 XP is built on the Windows 2000 platform.

I just built a new machine, so I installed XP Pro on it, and I also picked up a copy of W2000 from an independent seller here at Amazon, and loaded it on my AMD K62-500 for the network. Although I did have one video card that didn't have a W2000 driver, so I changed that very inexpensively with a great 128meg video card on sale with rebates for $29. So my old machines that were built in 1999 run W2000 great. No more programs freeze when several programs are open at the same time. You can leave a machine sitting for a couple of hours and not have it respond poorly when you come back to it, and have to reboot. No more blue screen error reports, having to reboot and run scan disk.

On my new XP machine, I had a bad program loaded, and when would run it, I would get a millisecond error screen, with an instant shut down, then it would reboot without having to run scan disk. I am assuming that since you can't mess with system files, no errors are created. I removed the program, which was a Mickey mouse add on included with a hardware bundle.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: Nancy Drew is off to the City of Dreams? [Is that right?] No? Anyway, she gets to rub elbows with a Soap Opera Star in the Big Apple. Oh yeah, there is the confusion; isn't this supposed to be in Hollywood? Well, it's all about climbing the ladder of goodwill and what better way than through the entertainment industry, right?

INITIAL SCORE: 85

CHARACTERS:
Mattie Jensen: The girl of the hour. Stick with her and you'll go far, kid. Well, all she did was sit around rehearsing lines, but that is the life of an actress. I did see her one scene she had acted which wasn't bad. No, I don't think she's the culprit. Why is she dating around so frequently like that? Ick.

Mille Strathorn: That silly old bat. Loved her riddles [half have been done before in other venues]. I think she is getting a little senile, but I don't think it was enough to be considered the culprit, especially since she owns the place.

Lillian Weiss: Man, she needs to get la.... wait, this is a family show. She was just a mean girl, but her abrasiveness was so strong that I doubted she was the culprit.

William Pappas: I only heard grumblings from his office. If he don't physically appear in the game, he ain't the culprit :P

Dwayne Powers: This guy was just falling apart! [Financially, second-guessing his relationship with Mattie, etc.]  I am glad he cast me as an extra! Yaahhh!

Rick Arlen: He was a smooth talker and a couple of his one-liners made me smile, but I had him firmly in my target sight as the evil villain.

Phone-A-Friends: This has got to be the 2nd best interplay in the relationship of Nancy/Ned aside from the Captive Curse argument. They said they loved each other! That was amazing only Adventure # 2 into the series since I don't believe I have heard it since. By game # 31, is the romance getting stale? This version of Bess had an odd accent and I believe this particular game was the most helpful George has ever been.

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 87

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
The background music was a little blander than other games, but it didn't detract from the ambience. You have to forgive the cartoonish graphics from 1999.  Overall, it was fine.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 87

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: Like I mentioned before, the riddles were intriguing since it hasn't been done again in the series. There were no mini games. :(  In fact, I think HER went with plot and culprit motivations over cheaper filler material, which makes this game stand apart from the later adventures in the series.

Since the 2003 version I have noticed a significant slowing of my computing but have been unable to identify the source.

I ran four different anti-spyware programs, I ""cleansed"" the system using all of Norton's utilities and still my computer was painfully slow hanging up on startup and shutdown. I even ran Hijack This and scrupulously followed the tutorial on MajorGeeks. My problems grew progressively worse until I read somewhere that Norton might well be causing my problems.

At first I discounted this possibility out of hand - I mean, after all, this was a premier program that had been around for years! Their new CEO is touted as the second coming by all of the business magazines and newspapers. Surely, IT couldn't be the source of my problems. But out of frustration I took Norton off of my computer and VOIL my problems went away! I couldn't believe it. No more computer crashes, no more slovenly performance, no more hanging up on shutdown and interminable startup times.

I was then confronted with finding another program to supplant Norton. I searched Cnet and came up with PC-Cillin! This program works great. I does not degrade performance one iota! No hanging up on shutdown or interminable startup times. This program works silently in the background and is literally updated daily in 3 - 5 seconds. I couldn't possibly be more pleased.

The firewall in this program seems to work OK - I am unable to appreciate a significant difference from my free version of Zone Alarm.  Spam control implementation is very clumsy, as are most other programs, and it would seem it will be awhile until we get a seamless elegant spam control solution, at least from Trend Micro.  Spyware is certainly no better than Ad-aware.

For the life of me I cannot understand how a company as distinguished as Symantec could fritter away all their goodwill and reputation by putting out a program that is quite simply awful.  I'm glad to be saying goodbye to Norton and its memory and system resource busting program.

At the end of the day the cornerstone of any security suite is going to be the anti-virus program.  PC Cillin's anti-virus program is second to none.  The rest of the suite is good, but not necessarily the best and the free programs from Zone Alarm and Ad-Aware are, IMO, better.  My recommendation, go with the PC Cillin anti-virus program and forget the suite.

Do yourself a favor. Forget Norton and McAffee. PC-Cillin anti-virus is incomparably better.

When I read a comparative analysis of the leading anti-virus software programs on the market a few years back, I made my switch and I've stuck with Kaspersky through its various iterations. But, I nearly chucked in the towel at KAV 10 when it slowed my computers down so much that I found myself disabling it more than often than not. That said, there is a noticeable performance improvement with KAV 2011.

The upgrade went smoothly on my Windows XP machine and installation was smoothly on my Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit) machines. The first thing I noticed after installation on the Win 7 machines was the interface changes and the addition of a (IMO, unnecessary) desktop widget. I like the new look; it's more straightforward and user-friendly. It tells you at a glance whether you have any problems with your protection. (If there's a problem a red or yellow bar will appear at the top of the interface, or the desktop widget will change color.) The basic settings are grouped and you can access the general/advanced settings by clicking a link at the top of the screen.

The 'Protection Center' lets you easily see and customize which areas of the program you'd like to have activated, such as data files and online/email protection. The 'Scan' section shows you see when your last scans (full system or critical files) ran and lets you run them if necessary. The 'Update Center' tells you when the last update was downloaded and lets you manually check for/download any new updates. And the 'Tools' lets you access the additional tools such as Rescue Disk, which allows you to make a bootable disk/USB drive in case your computer ever becomes infected beyond all reason, Vulnerability Scanner, which lets you see your computer's weak spots, Browser Configuration, which lets you tweak your Internet Explorer settings for enhanced security, Privacy Cleaner, which basically clears away your computer's history files, and System Restore, which is like Windows' System Restore except this is specifically for malware/viral threats.

In my experience the default settings are usually adequate for most users, but the advanced settings allow you to tweak the level of protection for each individual service (i.e. web and email scanning, customize update times--especially handy if the updates are slowing down the computer, etc.). However, some of the settings might go above the heads of laypersons and the icons aren't always intuitive; one would need to click on each to see what they are for and some may be averse to that in fear of changing something one isn't supposed to.

Running a full scan of the computer after upgrade threw up one false positive (WinDVD 8), but it was easy enough to add it to my trusted applications. I tested it on a few known 'bad neighborhoods' and each time I received a Kaspersky warning page telling me the site was trying to harm my computer. This is one of the features which makes it especially good for non-tech savvy computer users, especially those who may stumble onto a phishing or scam website.

One feature that I miss from a few versions ago was the ability to monitor/approve/deny registry changes made by applications. While I understand why they may have removed it (it's rather easy for a user to accidentally bork his system beyond repair), but it was a great feature for those who understood registry changes and wanted to see what software programs were doing what and when. In the grand scheme of the software, though, it's not a big deal.

Also, I've had problems using the virtual keyboard which loses focus when you access another program and can't be easily brought back into focus. And it's not clearly disclosed that there's a time limit on the installation. If you planned to add the software to a computer in the future, you'd be met by a bad surprise since all 3 installations must be used within 30 days of the first.

Despite a few quirks--it still slows down the system, but not nearly as much and it's much less noticeable on the Win 7 machines which are newer and more agile, a few of the settings aren't user-friendly, and the virtual keyboard is quirky--it's still one of the better anti-virus programs available in terms of effectiveness/protection, ease of use, and performance.",And After 5 Years...,1298505600,2,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dy0ukHF+L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQ3ZJJo-L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pTyXUr55L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WJV0vv+KL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QdeHzEEsL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51+4oFVK1iL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pOu6RsngL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51meG72+EPL._SY88.jpg']"

I had paid $79 for iWork '09 because it was having some staying power as the current version, and so on a whim I thought I would go and see what 2008 vintage Macintosh computing would be like, using my iMac 2.8GHz that I reviewed under iMac MB325LL/A. So since the iMac came with a Summer 2008 version of Leopard and iLife '08, I thought I would give iWork '08 a whirl since the iMac was overheating running the '09 versions of iWork and iLife and Leopard 10.5.8, not to mention Snow Leopard or Lion, or especially Mountain Lion.

Well, Pages and Numbers are lacking in features and the presentation of all three of them isn't quite as polished, but one little thing that really bugged me about the newer version of iWork, specifically Keynote '09 (some ""builds"" were only available as building in, while others were only available building out), was not the case on my copy of iWork '08. Other people's copies may be different, but iWork '08 proved that sometimes the grass is greener on the other side, even if it often isn't.

Seeing as how I love Keynote (always been fascinated by presentation programs, in fact I went to great efforts to take Microsoft Office for Mac 4.2.1 off of a Workgroup Server 6150 and put it on our primary family computer of the time, a Performa 6116CD to show you how much I loved presentation software) this was a delightful surprise making iWork '08 worth what I paid for it, which was $20 plus insignificant shipping, and it may find permanent use when I permanently semi-retire the iMac, which isn't totally through with school tasks yet, just taking a school task break to help increase it's longevity as much as possible.

So in the end, for what iWork '09 really let me down on but iWork '08 succeeded on, it's every bit as 5-starred as iWork '09, because I have Microsoft Office:mac 2008 Home and Student and 2 copies of Office 2007 I can rely on for more advanced stuff.

There is a new format this year and I'm not quite sure I like it.  It could be that I'm use to the old format.  However, the program still takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.

I tried Taxcut in the past because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).

I have to agree that the advertising included in the product (for more Intuit products) now borders on the ridiculous and the program (like all programs) needs more space and more resources each year but I still think that is better that the competition.

This application comes with licensing for 5 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but probably not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Windows Setup:

Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:

I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox would not start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). It was good I found a solution because this virtual machine is critical to my business. This was the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.

Since then I found the settings for exclusions. It isn't on the security page reached via the advanced button as one might expect, but found from the small gear icon for settings at the top of the control panel. The exclusions are buried in this group of settings pages. Go to settings, antivirus, scans tab, to Exclusions/Low Risks and then finally items to exclude.

If you want an integrated on-line backup solution, you might want to consider getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;that supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. For the difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a mile way from its actual location!!
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty lame. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antivirus products used on this computer did not, and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but does not include some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.

My review will focus mainly on version 11 independently.

Video editing and production software from most vendors works the same as music editing and production software packages. A timeline view allows the user to drag and drop content onto it and there is a plethora of special effects and transitions that can be applied to each element to make transitions easier and smoother. Users comfortable with the likes of Sony Acid or Cakewalk will feel right at home with this method of working.

PowerDirector provides a nice media manager that gives an excellent thumbnail view of all of the available content, and what comes with the package is a very good library of different types of content. The Media Room contains the actual media available immediately (though more can be imported without too much effort). The Effects Room contains a number of motion and blur effects that can be easily applied to visual elements on the timeline. The PiP (Picture in Picture) Room contains several animation elements, mostly drawing effects. The Particle Room contains a couple of motion-type effects that involve multiple embedded objects. The Title Room is for all things text and text effects. The Transition Room contains transition effects that apply to visual elements and made the change between two elements a lot smoother and/or more interesting. The Audio Mixing Room is a simple equalizer and sound balancer for audio elements. The Voice-Over Recording Room allows for direct recording into the production either through a microphone or from the sound card.

PowerDirector provides the ability to capture input from connected devices such as a webcam or a video recorder. The interface to these devices is very straightforward and simple - there's a record button that turns recording on and off, and there is the ability to change the location of captured content and resolution/bitrate settings.

PowerDirector is able to create media in a number of formats, both audio and video. Supported formats include AVI, MPEG-2, AVC, WMV, MPEG-4, MOV, and MKV files. I was unable to find MP3 file output which is a mild disappointment.

My son likes to make stop-motion videos with Legos, and for this task PowerDirector is well-suited. We have been able to import all of his photos at once (usually over 500 individual pictures) put them all on the timeline, change the display duration and create an initial cut at a  video in less than 10 minutes. Cyberlink claims to have fast rendering speeds, and PowerDirector 11 seems to live up to those claims in our workings.

Comparing versions 10 and 11, while there is a speed difference and there is some minor tweaks in the interface to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing, I am not sure that there's a compelling reason to upgrade to version 11 if you already have version 10. The main considerations are the speed improvements and the content, and the content does not seem to have changed too much so it comes down to speed. If the optimizations that make version 11 faster than version 10 are crucial, then it's worth pondering the upgrade. Try the trial version first before committing to see if this is worthwhile.

I like PowerDirector. It's a powerful and easy-to-use video production application that does a nice job of allowing a user to assemble a video quickly. The interface is mostly intuitive and the inner workings are efficient. This is a good package at a very reasonable asking price.","Solid, Intuitive Video Production Software",1357603200,2,

What you get with this is a product key for one copy of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote.  You do not get Publisher or Access.  In addition, this product key is only for one PC, not for use with a tablet or mobile device.  Skype and the 1TB OneDrive cloud storage option are also not included.

The intended user of this product would be the owner of a single PC in need of an Office suite.  A benefit of this product is the lack of a subscription based model meaning there is no expiration date.

To download the product, you need a Microsoft Account.

So my installation target for this was a brand new HP All-In-One, a higher end model with plenty of disk space and a current generation CPU and 16GB of RAM running Windows 10.

Installation was relatively painless and I had no issues, thankfully.  I did note all of the problems people have reported with downloading.

Everything seemed fine at first but I started to have major issues with Outlook hanging upon startup (not crashing).  Running Outlook in safe mode didn't work either.  To make a long story short, I finally solved this issue myself by noticing that I had incorrectly typed the password for my POP3 email server.  Believe it or not, correcting this password ended the startup hang.  I'm a software developer by trade and seeing this lack of error handling in a commercial product is alarming.

I had a bunch of emails saved in Windows Live Mail which I wanted to import (with no access to the Live Mail application, only the saved data) - no easy way to do this.  It took me quite a while to determine how to do this.

As for the rest of the suite, Powerpoint seems relatively unchanged as does Excel and Word.

For Enterprise users, there is a built in collaboration feature in Word 2016 which would be useful.  There is a tweak to the help system up in the ribbon bar which states ""Tell me what you want to do...""  This is essentially a quick search feature.  I also noticed a right click context menu addition called ""Smart Lookup"" which allows you to highlight a word and select Smart Lookup.  A Bing-powered search engine lookup features a definition of the highlighted word.  For writing mathematical equations, there is a feature called Ink Equation in which you can jot equations by hand (touch device, stylus, etc).  This is an improvement over the earlier Equation editor.  Other than that, the only improvement I saw was with Shapes (more presets, perhaps).

I am a frequent user of Excel so I was eager to learn what changed in Excel 2016. There are some new chart types, as far as I can tell they are Treemap, Sunburst, Histogram, Box & Whisker and Waterfall.  I could see myself using Histogram.  There are other changes common to all of the Office apps such as sharing and the stuff I mentioned about Word.

One thing to mention is that Office365 subscribers get feature updates which will not be available to the users of this product.

My evaluation of Office 2016 Home & Office is that it is intended for a specific audience.  Most users will get more out of Office 365 these days.  I guess I would expect a lot of improvements (both speed, stability and feature-wise) from a major new release.  I don't really see all that many groundbreaking improvements here.

I really miss the days of having a CD/DVD to install a product like this versus a cumbersome and slow download process.  Entering a product key and selecting Activate used to work fairly well.

Overall, if you have a new PC and have not used Office 365 before, this is a good option for getting a current Office suite.  I didn't have download and activation issues but many have.  The hanging with Outlook was not a nice touch and left me wondering if this product has been properly tested and debugged prior to deployment. I would suggest Office365 (yes, even with the subscription expy) so you at least get current updates to features.  The other thing I dislike about this is the ""use only on 1 PC"" thing.",Not a huge leap in feature improvements,1464134400,,

I had high hopes that this program would help address the first issue. No such luck. But it's an awesome Paint program.

WRT Photoshop - the program claims Photoshop compatibility, and this is true, inasmuch as it can open .psd files. It even preserves layers. What it doesn't do is bring in anything path- or object-based -- no splines, no fills, no reshaping, no manipulations that aren't bitmap/pixel rendering. If you thought the price for this as a Photoshop replacement was too good to be true, you were right.

WRT Paint - this does everything you ever wanted from that toy. Layers (as mentioned above), a much less useless zoom feature, all sorts of fun brushes and effects (with stylus pressure support), pixel-based transforms, and even a better-designed color mixer. Sweet.

Once I stopped expecting too much from it, the program was a lot of fun to play with, with a few annoyances. First annoyance -- the help function takes you to the help files for Painter itself, not Essentials. So, you will read about this cool feature, and then, at the bottom of the page, be presented with an apologetic ""Some features described in the Help are available only in Corel Painter 2015, and are not included in Painter Essentials 5. For more information about Corel Painter 2015, visit http://www.painterartist.com/""  (which is a store link). Essentials is the teaser for the more expensive program (which does support paths), and Corel makes no attempt to hide this. Second, as with all Corel's graphics programs, this software can only be installed once. Were you planning on changing machines any time soon?  Well, unless the first machine fails catastrophically, you can't take this with you.

Given the relatively low price of this package, I would still recommend it to budding artists and fingerpainting kids of all ages. It's not a professional tool, however, and doesn't really claim to be.

(Note - if you're looking for a real artist tool in this price range, check out Autodesk's Sketchbook Pro. That has a much steeper learning curve, and is still bitmap-based, but does a much better job of emulating a real drawing board workflow.)",Bitmaps only. Fun toy.

This is probably the best OS from Microsoft yet and while this OS is not perfect, it's very stable, secure and less resource intensive than Vista. It is also very fast, the UI is very appealing and has some great security features.

Pros:

Fast.

Looks Fantastic with Aero Glass.

Compatible with pretty much.. well just about anything from earlier version of Windows.

Better Video format capabilities allowing you to watch just about any video without any issues like in the early versions of Windows (98, XP)

Great OS to game with, XP was 'pretty good' and i had issues with Vista but Windows 7 is suburb!
Improved start menu, you can search for your less used programs, files and just about anything all within the start menu. And it's not full screen!

Cons:
Takes up more resources than XP most likely requiring a new desktop.

Windows Media Player will sometimes freeze up, i really don't know what causes it but it will often do it when cold booting your desktop and i also have 2 hard drives on the desktop with WMP set to both (music on both drives) so i'm not sure if it's just doing indexing or something but either way it gets to be a hassle sometimes, this has happened to a few systems with different hardware so i don't know whats up with that.

Windows update. Yes, this thing gets on my nerves and if you have Windows Defender enabled it will most likely have you update daily or every other day. One of the biggest gripes i have with the updates is that either if you reinstall your system (or install a new system) you will most likely be doing updates for about an hour or more and it drives me crazy when it's asking to restart the computer. The updates should be a bit more silent and do all the updates that require restart all at once. I had to also put the updates to manually install as otherwise the OS will prompt for a restart which will take place if you don't do anything or hit postpone. It doesn't allow you to manually restart when you are ready. Often i will have music playing and once the computer restarts no more music so that is a big minus for me, the updates should be more silent and either have the restarts set to manual or a better way of doing updates that require restart.

Cost. For what Windows 8 is worth and the direction MS chose with 8, it's really just sad that Windows 7 is at the price as it is. But in the end you get a true version of Windows 7 and not a butchered version of it, it's practically worth it to get a copy of Windows 7 versus getting Windows 8. Home Edition of Windows 7 is really all most need and that is a bit cheaper than Professional or Ultimate. Even though Windows 7 is only supported through 2020, it's all most really want out of an OS and you won't have to mess with 3rd party alternatives just to keep your start menu. Windows 8 is not faster, it does save on system resources better than Windows 7 but not by much. If you have problems with Windows 7 performance i would check the hardware before assuming it's Windows 7 itself. It is very fast and there is no notable difference in speed between Windows 7 & 8.

If you want to avoid UI headaches with Windows 8, just get Windows 7. You still have 7 years of support and who knows, if it's popular and no one is getting Windows 8 or 9 or whatever, MS will have no choice but to extend the lifecycle of Windows 7, like they did with XP. If you like Windows 7 and don't really care for the direction 8 is going towards, i suggest getting a copy of 7 so MS will restore the start menu and allow desktop users the freedom of choosing desktop UI or a tablet UI. I for one don't see a need of a tablet UI on my desktop. It's like trying to put wheelbarrow tires on a truck. It could be done if you do some tweaking but in the end it just looks silly and it's not practical. That's how i feel about Windows 8. Why bother tweaking Windows 8 to look like Windows 7, when Windows 7 itself has all you need and more. Windows 8 doesn't even have native DVD playback, you gotta download and possibly purchase WMC to get it back and they are removing WEI and the backup features so Windows is becoming less and less like an OS and more like an app center device. Even if you prefer having XP over Windows 7, if your system is capable you can dual boot with zero problems with Windows 7 and XP. Just remember to have XP installed first and a hard drive with the XP partition up to half of what you have or about 20GB and 80GB (35GB minimum) for Windows 7. That way you have the best of both worlds. Windows 7 is great for both home, professional and business users.","Worth getting over Windows 8, XP users should upgrade to 7",1375228800,,

I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!
  I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a ""power user,"" especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.
  One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable.  For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available.  Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!
  In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable!  You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.
  The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it ""thinks"" you will need at the moment.  It is rarely right!  ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier!  There is one small ""tool bar"" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons.  It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.
  Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!
  Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one.  In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text.  That has been omitted in 2007.  In the ""improved"" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!
  To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions.  After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats!  If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format.  The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!
  Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems.  For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen.  Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed.  When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text.  When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top!  Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in!  (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation!  ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)
  For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.
  I have always loved Microsoft Office.  It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case.  I believe Microsoft tried to produce something ""different"" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past.

I am a point and shoot digicam user. I've played around a little with other photo editing software, but I am far from an experienced user. If you have never used this kind of software before, you will need to spend some time reading the manual and playing around with the different tools in this program. It is actually pretty intuitive, but if you have never ever done any photo editing, it may all look confusing to you. Don't worry - once you get the hang of it you will be thrilled with the results.

Besides basic photo editing like cropping, sharpening, noise reduction, lighting adjustment and saturation adjustment, you will find a host of fun adjustment pre-sets that automatically convert your photo into a B&W, a sepia-tone, apply a ""Barbara Walters"" softening filter, will ""posterize"" your photo, and all sorts of wonderful adjustments.

You can also remove unintended objects (or offending ex-husbands) quickly and easily while still preserving your photo.

My favorite feature is the People Beautifier. It has a Tooth Brush which lets you easily whiten teeth in a photo, an Eye Blinger which whitens and brightens eyes and enhances eyelashes and eyebrows, a Skin Smoother and Wrinkle Remover, and a Body Shaper which lets you instantly lose weight and redistribute what's left!

There is a basic users manual included in the box and it will certainly get you started. But the many nuances of this program are not covered. Still, if you spend some time playing around with PhotoDirector, you'll discover just how many things you can do with it and how easy it is to use.

I typically shop for security software all year long - when I see a good deal, I buy it, knowing that at some point, my annual subscription will require (expensive) renewal.  So it was in June 2011 when I bought PURE on a 100% rebate special. It sat on my shelf for 5 months while my KIS-2011 subscription ran out, then I tried to install PURE, after doing a complete un-install of the expired KIS-2011 product.

While PURE installed OK, updated, ran scans, and appeared to provide firewall protection, it was incompatible with MS Outlook (Office 2010 - 64 bit version).  I could not start MS Outlook if PURE was running as Outlook would just hang indefinitely.  If I exited PURE, Outlook ran fine.  This problem is widely posted now on various forums, and it appears that Kaspersky still has not been able to fix it in the current version of PURE (I had build 152 after it completed all of the updates).

After hours of troubleshooting with Kaspersky techs, they recommended that I try KIS-2012, so I downloaded the Trial version, un-installed PURE, and installed KIS. It works perfectly - no issue with hanging my email client.

So unless you really need the additional features of PURE, I'd recommend staying away from it this year.  KIS-2012 has been updated, works fast, unobtrusively, and reliably.

It took me a couple weeks to work out an exchange for the non-usable PURE product, but Kaspersky made good on an exchange and I now have KIS-2012 going for the coming year.  Not a big deal for me as there is better Password manager and disc encryption software available, and I don't need remote management of security in my small business environment.

I gave it 3-stars because the rest of the product appeared to work as advertised -- I just could not use the Anti-Spam, nor could I run my email client at all when PURE was installed.",Kaspersky PURE incompatible with MS Outlook 2010,1325548800,,

Setup is awkward and confusing.  It comes with a single windows disk and a piece of paper telling you that you should go to norton's website.  There on norton's website, it asks you to create or login to your existing account, where it will present you with a ""device manager"".  You can ""add a device"" and select the type of device.  If it's an ios or android device, it will send you an email, with a link to their app in either the apple or android online store.  You download the app, launch it, login to your account, and it's up and running.  For a mac, it just downloads the app directly to your machine, and you can run the installer.

Most people with computers know what the norton suite traditionally does.  Mainly virus prevention and removal.  But it does something completely different for mobile devices.  First, it has ""anti-theft"" features.  You login to your same online norton account, and from there you can locate your device (brings up a map and shows you where it is), or lets you ""scream"" (make a loud alarm sound to scare the would-be thief).  It also lets you backup your contacts.

Also when you launch the app on Android it lets you run a malware scan, which also reports ""privacy risks"", which is actually kind of cool in that it tells you what information certain apps are collecting.

I would often let the answering machine take the call and then I would return it once I was able to bring up the customers history including emails. Now it is all integrated into QuickBooks; smart move Intuit.

Of course they are in to it to make money. (No pun intended) so payroll now includes paying only 1 employee instead of 3 like it used to. It is now $2 per employee, per month for each additional employee. However that is a lot cheaper than a payroll service.

For those who are angry at Intuit for the challenges of setting up the installation, all I can say is what else is there? Hey I get frustrated like the next guy but I have been using Intuit products since their inception. (I am an old late 80s DOS guy to start) They have always been way ahead of the curve in making easy to use intuitive products; hence the name Intuit. I was frustrated with Qbooks 2013 in the colors they chose to display. It was hard on the eyes, next to 2010, but then they corrected that pretty much with an update.

I love QuickBooks. I have been running my company with 2010 QB Pro and there isn't anything I don't love about it. I could get critical and say when I am sending a customer an email it locks me out of being able to go anywhere else other than that window. That is one of the advantages of 2014 thanks to its greatly enhanced email functions.

QB 2014 also sports a calendar with reminders. I often use my tasks option in Outlook for running my business. So doing this in QuickBooks will seem like second nature to me.

QuickBooks in years past kept me so organized that when I got into a dispute with a business associate over some numbers he was blown away at how easily I could provide reports that substantiated everything I was saying. Consequently I got paid for what we agreed I would be paid for.

One important tip is that if you are running more than one business you may want to keep your old version as well. Be sure and back up your company files before loading a new version. When loading any new version of QuickBooks it asks you if you would like to keep the old version, or overwrite it. I keep the old version AND I choose not to have my company file updated to the new version. That way I can keep two versions of QuickBooks open at the same time. It is tedious to have to close one company, and open another every time a customer has a question. So by having two versions running concurrently, you can click on either tab and have instant access. You also can have one version running on one machine, and another version running on another if you have more than one person in the office, and each one assigned to a different company. It saves money that way not having to pay for two new versions when the old one works fine.",I'm an Intuit fan. Been so since the DOS days. Perfect? No. Great for the purpose? Yes.,1387065600,2,

It's a powerful product, with a clean upgrade path to it's big brother. But it will be a very long time before I grow out of this one.

Here are my favorite features:

Motion Tracking: you can open a motion video (a camcorder video, for example), mark an object in the video, and Anime Studio will track that object through multiple frames. You can then use this marker to attach one of your animations. Imagine the possibilities: Animated characters can dance with your children on video-all you have to do is animate the character, then attach the animated character to your child in the video. Cool!

Lip Syncing: You can sync a characters lip movements to audio easily. This is pretty hard to do manually. Anime Studio has a command to take care of it. So the character dancing with your child can sing too!

Lots of Import options, including Photoshop. Anime Studio preserves Photoshop layers, which saves lots of time if you use Photoshop.

Finally, keep in mind that animations are not necessarily cartoons. Anytime you need a picture or text to move in a complex way on top of or below other pictures, you are doing animation. So there are business applications too (think product instructional videos with animations of parts interacting with other parts, with hatches opening and latches latching...you get the idea).

Even worse, when you figure a way to get back to a normal desktop -- the type you have been trained to use now for over 20 years -- MS decides on some sneaky way to throw you right back into the clumsy Metro interface!  Indefensible, Microsoft.

If you thought Vista was bad, you'll find Windows 8 is much, much worse.  It's clear to me that MS did little to no desktop user experience testing before sending this piece of software ""krappola"" out the door to make bundles of licensing cash.  It also looks particularly sleazy of them to do this when you realize that modern, well designed OS interfaces like Linux Mint and the new Mac OSX ""Mavericks"" are totally free.  Microsoft tries to rob you of over $100 for this ugly OS ""upgrade"" version and up to $200 if you want to go for the ""full"" install of the ""Pro"" version.

And if the horrid Metro UI isn't enough to scare you away, please realize the if you buy the ""upgrade"" Win8 OS package because you already have XP/Vista/Win7 on your system but then decided (smartly) to do a clean install of Win8 (because the install DVD gives you this option), you'll soon find out that the activation key provided by Microsoft in the ""upgrade"" DVD package DOES NOT WORK!

More than once Ive heard people say that its one of the best (if not the best) titles in the series. But it also has a reputation for being fairly scary and having very complicated puzzles. I guess it was that reputation that turned me off to this game, but I finally ended up buying it because I felt like I couldn't call myself a true Nancy Drew fan without having played Curse of Blackmoor Manor. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.

Like I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.

CHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.

SETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.

PUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There weren't really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.

IS IT CHALLENGING? Absolutely. There was no way I could have figured out some of those puzzles without a walkthrough. 4.5/5

ENDING - 4/5: The ending was good, but not as strong as the other aspects of the game. The reveal at the end and the appearance of the culprit was kind of abrupt and a little underwhelming. The culprits motives made sense but I didn't really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.

It has had a good run.  It still offers something to those who want to plan long road-trips in legs, I guess, but even that use is fading with more compact GPS systems.  The mapping system does what it says it does, so that's fine....

What bothers me is how poorly the GPS hardware works.  Upon first installation, I was right next to a window, and it could not pick up any satellites at all and asked if I had a clear view of the sky -- well, no, and unless you're driving in a convertible....

Finally, as a passenger in a mini-van, I was able to obtain ""constant-intermittent"" service.  ""Huh?"" you might well ask.  Well, at least every mile, the hardware would lose satellite tracking, reacquire it, and then squelch out in its chirpy/brittle voice (even my old GPS has 6 smooth voice-choices for English) that it was re-routing and tell me again and again and again what the next turn is.  That became extremely annoying after about 3 minutes, as it was impossible to have a conversation in the vehicle, even when the next turn is in 51 miles.

What you must do is create and plan a ""trip"" to your destination from some place you recently passed, while driving (disclaimer....), from whence it will re-route your ""trip,"" just to make the unit function using the same approach it did years ago before the GPS component was introduced.

I run a jewelry design business and had been using an old version of Quicken to track inventory for tax purposes. I'd heard good things about Quick books and decided to investigate it for my home business application.

Installation was super easy. The more difficult part was learning how to make the options work for me. This is a robust program that tracks much more than inventory, also allow check writing, bookkeeping and much more. Some users take classes just to understand how to use the program effectively. I didn't avail myself of that opportunity since I was only interested in the inventory tracking portion.

The initial setup was more complicated than Quicken but allows many more options. Itemizations such as Vendor Options include Purchase Orders, the ability to receive inventory with or without invoices, enter bills against inventory and more. There's a Customer section where one can create invoices, sales receipts, refunds and credits and receive payments. Under Company one can chart accounts, items and services, and a variety of inventory related activities. Finally a Banking section lets you write checks, reconcile accounts, print checks and record deposits-in short, everything a business, large or small needs to track.

For inventory tracking, once you input a vendor and select a category (many from which to choose that include supplies, office, postage and more), it is possible to list each item bought and track stock quantities, and this was accomplished with only a quick perusal of the tutorial. I like that you can manage customer, vendor, and employee data in one place easily, with quick access to related transactions. Reports can be created instantly, but one of the items most appealing to me is that you can pick up new skills at your own pace with the built-in Learning Center.

No software can do the hard work for you of training your brain to recognize sounds, training your tongue to make them, and learning an entirely new set of vocabulary. But Rosetta Stone tries to make this process fun, intuitive, and simple. When you are trying to do something as difficult as learning another language, you don't need other difficulties thrown in your path. Attending a traditional class--driving, reading books, studying flash cards, interacting with other people who know the language just as poorly as you do--in my opinion introduces many more difficulties into the language learning process and is the cause of many people's failure to advance. If this is you, I recommend Rosetta Stone, which will allow you to advance beyond beginner level in a language in the comfort of your own home, using your own computer and the provided headset and microphone. When compared with the cost of taking a traditional course along with drive time and cost of books, Rosetta Stone's value becomes apparent.

Rosetta Stone is fun. At times, it can feel like a video game. The program does a good job of continuously challenging both your vocabulary and your tongue (as you have to pronounce the words more or less accurately) without being so difficult as to be dishearteningly discouraging.

Rosetta Stone immediately immerses the learner in the world of the language trying to make you forget your mother tongue (in my case English) as much as possible as you learn. This is, as far as I can tell, the best way to make oneself truly fluent. It is the way that I learned Spanish (total immersion), and in my opinion Rosetta Stone does as good of a job of that in a computer setting as I could imagine using today's technology.

I recommend purchasing levels 1, 2, & 3 together in a set so that you can advance far enough to actually begin intelligent conversations with native speakers. Rosetta Stone will only be able to advance you to a point, getting you out of beginner status. But to move on from there to fluent, will most definitely require surrounding yourself with people who speak the target language. But I am aware of no better value than Rosetta Stone to make that transition into another culture and language possible. I am looking forward to taking the next step.

I do have  word of caution from my experience regarding Windows Vista 64-bit software and Rosetta Stone's technical support. I was able to ""successfully"" install the software but unable to load any of the language modules into the software. After multiple calls (3+ hours) to technical support with a wide range of suggestions, I was finally told that Rosetta Stone is not supported on Vista 64 bit. This is somewhat frustrating and will likely be an issue more many purchasers of newer computers. I have read in reviews and blogs that some have been able to make it work, but I was unable to. I ended up having to install it on a secondary (and older) computer system. This was an inconvenience and something that I personally feel is an inexcusable oversight for high-end software. For lack of 64-bit support and the slowness of technical support to identify this issue, I have dropped my rating of the software from 5 stars to 4 stars.",Excellent Value & Great Way to Learn Language; Warning Regarding 64-Bit Windows Vista,1239840000,13,

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).","Expensive, but worth it! painless and powerful",1099440000,,

On one DVD, you are getting essentially a textbook with a few extras that will be good for years to come. I think this is a good reference for several different types of mathematics that students will encounter from middle school through college, but in all honesty, I purchased it with my daughter in mind. She's currently taking Pre-Algebra in 6th grade and I wanted to give her a leg-up by offering a supplement at home that was not her textbook.

After playing with the software myself these are my impressions.

INTERFACE: How it Looks

This program is not overly appealing visually, but it's not terrible either. If you have the sound on, the voices (several are used depending upon where you are in the program) are a bit boring. Can anyone really fix that one though?  In parts of the program the makers use a space-age theme; in the Algebra Booster for example, there is a math game designed to help kids think algebraically while doing a Pac-Man type game. I played it and found it to be 'OK'.  My 11 year old wasn't overly impressed, but I think she was expecting it to play like her other video games. Bottom line: It really looks like something from 1999 versus 2009.

CONTENT:  What's on the DVD?

For each of the math subjects: Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I... through Calculus and Statistics, there are tabs at the top of the screen.

 ""Lessons"" has subcatagories of 'Basics' and 'Chapters'.  This is basically like a textbook or reference book that you can read when you need it.  Another tab, ""Challenge"" is a problem that in the end asks you questions, but I didn't find an answer to the question... just more questions.  I guess it's designed to help students think a bit deeper.  The third tab is ""Exercises"", which as you would imagine has questions relating to whatever subject inside a math type you are studying.  If you get the wrong answer, it tells you you're wrong, but since they are multiple choice, you never get an explanation, you just get to choose again.  You can view your score and get a report on which ones you got right and wrong to review.  ""Real Life"" is a story problem.  Using the current skill set to solve an every-day issue.  ""Animation"" is a short video illustrating the current skill. It's the company's attempt to 'cartoon up' the software. For visual learners this will be helpful, but the few I viewed were kind of stupid.

The DVD also has bonus applications:  Runes of Avalon and Calculus Ipod material.  I couldn't get the link for the ipod material to open on my computer despite having iTunes and an Ipod Touch, but the game, Runes of Avalon, did install and I played it. It's more a spacial recognition game versus a math game, but it looks good (better than the rest of the software) and the gameplay was smooth.

A strange addition to the package was a CD with animal screensavers on it. The animals look like they are licking your monitor clean. Cute, but seemed like it fell into the wrong box!

CONCLUSION: Would I buy it again? Was it what I was looking for in math-help software?

I got a heck of a deal on this one - under 10 dollars when the local warehouse store was still selling it for over thirty. If I'd paid more, I probably would be a bit irked, but for the money paid... I'm happy. I would buy it again and recommend it as a 'reference' source.

As for whether it was what I was looking for... yes and no. I expected explanations of the subjects listed. I got that and examples, just like a textbook would offer. What I didn't get was the ability to print off worksheets and answer sheets for practice. That would have been great! I found a few places online with free worksheets and some paid sites, but I had hopes that this would offer this and it didn't. Some more games would have been great too, as would the ability of the software to give feedback on a step-by-step basis, versus simply 'wrong' and then you figure it out.

This is a good math resource for any math students seeking a supplement to their current textbook, but it is not software that's filled with useful games and printable worksheets. I found the Cliff notes books (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Algebra-I-Cliffs-Quick-Review/dp/076456370X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Algebra I (Cliffs Quick Review)</a>&nbsp;to be just as helpful, but I couldn't put them on my computer and it would be much more expensive to get them all versus this dvd.","Adequate reference source, but could be better",1261008000,3,

I went to a video learning company to see how this version 7 works, about two weeks ago, so I could give this review a better shot.

1. The reason I wanted it in the first place:  I bought a video of a man painting a portrait in Corel Painter.  He uses a transparent background in SketchBook, to do a very (blacks, greys, and whites) lifelike rendering of a man with curly hair, a long, scraggly beard, and amazing features that make artists drool.  He showed how he imports the sketch into Painter, and with layers, he paints the man, lifelike, while erasing the sketch a bit at a time.

2. I wanted software to do renderings (just sketching with black, grey, and white values), and under-paintings, on a less memory-intensive app.  This is a big deal, because I leave a lot of apps running (Photoshop, Painter, Browser with tabs, my calender, and sometimes videos with stop action to remind myself to watch them on my iMac.

3. I was told it is very easy to draw with; I have shaky hands, and, even with a large tablet and pen, I cannot draw a decent curve or straight line.

It is very easy, relatively to draw portraits, or other symmetrical, and semi-symmetrical renderings from life.  As others may have done, I will try to not use technical terms, because I intend to describe their functions, and what they result in (what the results look like), because I get so lost when I hear software-specific technical terms.

This app has traditional-like tools that Photoshop and Painter do not have, like a french curve, for example (which is what artists use to make perfect curves). If you wanted to draw a perfect rounded corner rectangle - to make the rounded edges have perspective.

Let's say you have to make the rectangle, and you want all sides to be the same - there is a tool that will let you draw one part, while the other part draws it's self.  Very cool.

There is a mechanism in the app that lets you draw, not only horizontal and vertical straight lines in either direction, but it enables you to draw a perfect diagonal line.

Let's say you wanted to put an oval or circle with a straight line through the middle; it can be done with the app, without worrying about shaky hands.

If you draw, you would likely know how handy this is.  And a time-saver as well.

It's a pretty intuitive interface - if you realize that some tools are sort of hidden, as on the top-right of the vertical toolbox on the left side of the screen (as it is positioned right after you load it for the first time), there is a small box, you will find the special pens there in all their vibrant colors, that Anime and Mange characters have been created with from where they originated.  (If you want SketchBook just for these type of pens you can download it for free - just search for it.  I don't see any reason, though, to deny yourself all these traditional-like drawing and coloring tools, unless the price point is too steep for you. Flexible pay-as-you-go, and Cloud-based services are available on your desktop for a lower up-front price.

There are all kinds of pens, markers, erasers, pencils that you can customize, and save special as you wish.  It might take you awhile though, to start customizing, as you will have a whole lot of tools already!  Don't forget there are tool tips when you hover over tools and drawing media. You can find a whole bunch of features listed if you go to preferences.  I forget hearing about this in the educational video, but I think the mark-making tools like brushes, etc. are pressure-sensitive with something like a Wacom Tablet.  There are inexpensive ones, and not just Wacom is compatible.  Drawing with a mouse plain old doesn't work well with these types of apps.

Much like in other illustration or design apps, colors can be altered in many ways - or should I say, manipulated.  If you go to preferences you will see how opaque or as rich and bright your colors can be.  You will also find other features that you will most likely find in Photoshop or Painter.  Of course, you can change how many undos, there are selection tools, move, edit, rotate, and scale layers, and so many more features.

There is a toolbar at the top as well as a semicircle of tools - making a total of 5 ways to control the app - if you include your top menu bar, and the preferences.  Click around.  It is impressive for the money.  You can even control where your toolbars go.  Of course, you can push the TAB key on your keyboard and hide everything except the image you are working on.

There is a way to set your image size and, the default file format is tiff., which is a smaller, but decent quality file.  This can be exported into a .tiff, jpeg, .bmp, Pixir PSD, or of course an Adobe Photoshop PSD, which imports nicely into Painter or PS.

Of course - layers to build your sketches, making each layer a different part of the sketch.  To newbies, read documentation of some kind. Search for it online.

And more below:

New features -

There are Perspective Guides to easily lay down perfect 1-point, 2-point, 3-point, and fisheye perspective (if you don't know about artistic perspective - search online)
Also,the flipbook animation tool for expressing motion in sketches - WOW!
And, there is an enhanced layer editor, including expanded blend modes and layer grouping. Blend modes are  effects that you can make specific to separate layers; and, if you want, you can separate a group of layers from other layers to save you time, scrolling to organize and streamline layers.
The dynamic flood fills with solid, linear, and radial gradients - Gradients are two or more colors blending into each other.  Nice fill for backgrounds, making painted-looking drawings look nice - like making a sun look like it is white hot in the center, radiating out to yellow and maybe orange.  Sunsets.  Skies.
The distort transform tool to adjust and position perspective - you can reshape your graphics.
And, finally, improved selection control with polyline and magic wand selection - this means if you want to isolate and manipulate one part of your image, there are tools to do it better.

I already have Norton installed and purchased this in advance so I chose the 5 device key card. Also, you can try (15 or 30 day trial version) direct from Norton and, if you are happy, you can then get a key card to extend your subscription for an additional 366 days. I say choose the lowest cost to meet your needs.

Second, since I have been using Norton for years, I thought it would be easier just to renew my subscription with a key code. Plus, this one was for 5 devices so I could also include my 2 Android devices. Unfortunately, I encountered a problem with my key code on my second computer where it stated the key code was not for my product. I called Norton where a very courteous representative worked with me over the phone as well as online to complete my renewal subscription. Originally, she told me I would have to download a different version but, in the end, I was able to enter my key code to renew. I had no problem with my third computer.

My first (Lenovo tablet) Android device immediately upgraded (from lite Norton mobile version) to the full version once I signed into my Norton account. My second (Tianle TV stick) Android device did not upgrade where I needed to uninstall Norton for mobile app and re-install it. Once I re-installed the Norton for Mobile devices and signed into my Norton account, it immediately upgraded to full version.

Anyway, overall, I'm sure Norton AntiVirus is (and has been) a good product for internet online security. But, since there are many other good (and free) antivirus choices, I can only rate this product as okay. Also, I didn't like having a problem with my subscription renewal process.

FYI: I recommend including Norton's (free) Identity Safe program for computers and mobile app for Android/Apple devices. This is one of the better password manager interfaces. With Norton Identity Safe, you have your passwords easily available on any computer or device you may be using. Plus, when you add or update any site password, it is available on any other computer or device you are using.",Good AntiVirus For All Your Needs,1442016000,,

We all learn our native languages that way and it is typically the best way to learn additional languages.

You get the actual software for your computer with easy to follow lessons. There's an interactive DVD (especially good if multiple people in the house are learning the language). There are audio lessons for those who are auditory learners. There are games. This package has pretty much everything. The most attractive thing about it is the price: it is a fraction of the cost of other immersion software and provides much of the value. If you're on a tight budget, this is a product to consider.

The other aspect of immersing yourself in the language is to have conversations with those who already speak it, watch TV shows and movies subbed, dubbed, or initially filmed in Spanish, and to even start using it regularly (write your grocery list, to-do list, etc in Spanish).

After installation, the program advised it was ready to install service pack 3.  I clicked install and it indicated the installation was successful and launched the program.

I mainly use video editing programs to trim down personal videos to make them a more watchable and enjoyable size, so I'm reviewing this from that perspective.  I don't use these for film class or to try to become the next Spielberg.  I simply want to clean up and edit my video.  For this particular example, I used eight clips from a Sony Action cam that I recently filmed on vacation and an MP3 song encoded at 256kbps as background music. I only used one track each for video and audio.

The only effects I added were a few transitions. I'm not really into effects other than basic titles.  Since I planned to use this project as the example for my review, I added the transitions to see how theyd affect encoding.  My PC has an Intel 2.8mhz dual-core i7 processor, 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM, Nvidia Quadro 1000M GPU and is running 64-bit Windows 10.

I trimmed the eight clips down to about 7 minutes and trimmed the music to match. Other than the transitions, I added no other effects.  It took about 12 minutes to encode the video to a full-HD MP4 at 30fps.  Although the fan kicked on, it didn't seem to burden down my PC and the temperature hit a max of 126 degrees F while encoding. The end result was very good with clear video and sound and no dropped frames or other issues.

Usability is straightforward although those familiar with this type of video editing software will be up and running a little quicker than those coming from programs like the newer versions of iMovie.

Videostudio X9 meets my needs which are admittedly fairly basic.  I can't speak for how it will perform for someone who needs tons of special effects and features but if you need a good capable editor for simple to moderate complexity, it can definitely handle it.  It does so with reasonable resource usage.  My only complaint, which is not unique to this version, are the in-your-face ads to upgrade.  You can click to choose not to show the ads again but it doesn't make it any less annoying.  If someone wanted Ultimate, they would have purchased Ultimate.

And I say forced because Microsoft made sure that key features of my OS was not working anymore, including its security. So, Win7 was a brief yet not a bad altogether experience - if one disregards numerous lack of customization options and the palpable effort of Microsoft to make us abandon them yet again, that is. Such as stopping our desktop widgets from working in order to promote the ""brilliant"" Win8 tiles! Nevertheless, what I want to make clear is that I am comparing Win10 to an extensive background on WinXP and an adequate experience with Win7.

ALL YOUR BASES ARE BELONG TO US
Two words: forced updates. I was lucky enough to have opted for the Professional edition of the Win7, so when I got to switch to Win10, I received the Professional edition as well - which comes with the option to defer (yet still not pick between or even cancel) the installation of the latest updates. Currently, I am trying to ignore the Action Center notification for an nVidia update, that keeps pestering me to install it since las week. The Home edition, however, does not give the user any such option and all updates are forced onto him. Remember how after numerous ""essential"" updates in the past, our PCs encountered a myriad or mysterious problems that were never solved before the next update, months later? Yeah, there is no more avoiding these problems anymore.

A PRIVACY NIGHTMARE
From the initial Logging in only with a Microsoft-confirmed eMail account to the Groove Music and the Movies & TV Players amassing info on your files and personal habits, including the content of our eMails which MS ""reserves the right"" to pass on (read: sell) to unnamed third parties(!). There is no avoiding it: Win10 are a private person's worst nightmare. In a sense, Win10 are the basis of the most intrusive and abusive DRM ever to be slipped in in our computers, coupled with the most blatant disregard for a person's privacy at home. There had been an uproar even since the pre-release builds and some deactivation options are now available - but they are far from thorough and very prone to turning back on by themselves after a while. And it now begs the question: how much can one trust a company that silently downloaded Win10 to every WinVISTA, Win7 and Win8 PC without the consent of their owners?

NO, IT IS NOT FASTER BY ANY MEANS!
Microsoft did not allow us to perform a clean install when upgrading from a previous Microsoft OS; however, using one's product Serial Number, it was possible to download the official image and burn it onto a disk (or transfer it to an empty USB). In preparation for the upgrade, I increased my system's RAM to 12GM and a few days after the initial update, I formated and did a clean install. Then I went on installing only software that was Win10 compatible. Keep this information in mind when I tell you that Win10 are SLOW. Slower than Win7 and much, much slower than WinXP! It takes forever to transfer files to and from a USB flash drive (a problem that started with Win7, supposedly to prevent data loss when removing drives insecurely, yet still with no option to toggle it on and off). What is more aggravating, it takes forever to explore folders, especially those on my second HDD, even if they were opened just a few moments ago.
So, why is it not faster? Is it because of an increase in cosmetic additions and aesthetic customizations? No. Absolutely no. Kindly read on.

ESSENTIAL CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS ARE MISSING
The Windows interface and Menu options look worse than Win7. Aero Glass, for some unfathomable reason, is not available. The Windows borders are not customizable (for the first time since Win95!). Quick Launch can be made to appear with some Registry editing (I would advise Googling it - carefully!) yet the icons in this DIY Quick Launch now cannot be centered in the Toolbar and they stay misaligned to the Task View button; the option of which icons and how to appear in the Taskbar is missing; whereas, this latest shinny OS refuses to learn that I do not like every shortcut to have a ""Shortcut to"" prefix to every shortcut I create - something Win98 had no problem learning after the third time I removed it on a new one.
There is a semi-official piece of software (no, I am not calling them Apps!) called Windows Ultimate Tweaker 4: I would recommend it as it does offer a number of options, some of which are very useful. However, one of the most important ones (specifically: which new file-templates and options to appear when right-clicking on the desktop) -you guessed it!- is missing.
And do not get me started on the Start Menu!

WHY MESS WITH SOMETHING THAT WORKED FINE?
Win8 were a complete failure mainly because of their Start menu. We all loved the WinXP Start Menu, easy to use, a breeze to customize and backup when needed. Win7 improved on it, even if, quite counter-intuitively, one had to use libraries in order to add personal folders in the Start Menu. Yet, everything was at the right place. Well, not so much with Win10.
The Power button now looks like any other and is to be found between(!) All-Apps and Settings - and when pressed (remember that this will also be needed to be done at 2:00AM after 12 hours of working on a screen) one has to read and carefully select between the Shut Down or Restart options that appear. Every single time. With no confirmation dialog.
The installed software (All-Apps) are alphabetized easy to navigate - yet its folders do not respond to Right-clicking them. They are just dead.
The Tiles Panel, however, this is where they screwed up again: none of the tiles are customizable in other aspects than total size (resulting in beautiful icons looking ridiculous in all that empty background). Why can we not readjust the sizes of the contained icons? And yet they even failed to adjust the tile sizes correctly!
The Tiles Panel allows resizing but only in huge pre-set steps. We can also move and group the tiles. Some (but not all) tiles come in 4 sizes, others in 3 yet most in only 2 sizes. The step-wise increments of the Tile Panel create space for 6 small tiles in each group. (if you are asking why, I shall tell you why: because 5' screen Windows Phones can show 6-tiles, that's why!). Have less than 6 tiles in a group and the empty space is an ugly waste. Moreover, no tile under them can grow to fill the space under 6 small tiles, so, once again, more ugly wasted space.
Oh, and for some another mysterious reason, not all installed software can be pinned to the Tile Panel, even if they do appear in the All-Apps list! You have to hunt for them in your Program Files and find the executable.

COMPATIBILITY MODE IS STILL A JOKE
Drakensang: The Dark Eye is not an old game, barely 5-6 years old and it is supposed to be Win10 compatible. At least its expansion is, and that run fine. The original game, however, refused to run under any ""compatibility mode"". Does this thing finally do anything besides reducing the resolution, Microsoft? You know, like trying running a few years old software under DirectX 9.0c or something?

ALL KNOWN BUGS ARE STILL THERE
The Recycle Bin still refuses to use its customized icons, just like with Win7. The Explorer folders are still unable to retain my Viewing preferences. And the Desktop still ...looses files (especially saved web-pages) one then has to hunt down with the Explorer (even if they are still in the Desktop folder).

Overall, not a failure of WinVISTA or Win8 proportions but nowhere near as good as WinXP - or even Win7 for that matter.

I am willing to accept this as a work in progress and give them 6 months to get their act together and patch things up.
Yet they should not think that they will get a free ride just because they claim to be giving it away for ""free"". Because it was not.

I find XP easier to navigate, but perhaps it`s because I`ve had years of experience with XP and have only recently been introduced to Vista.  I am sure I will get more comfortable with Vista in time.

Vista does run very smoothly and I love the desktop sidebar, to which we can add numerous little gadgets, like a clock, calendar, weather reports.  So handy.  I wonder why they didn't think of that earlier.  I had been desperately searching for such features for my XP before running into it on Vista.

My only complaint about it is the compatibility issues I'm having with a few things.  I am sure that eventually, this will cease to be a problem.

Not everyone wants or needs to use parental controls, but I happen to like them.  I finally have controls not just on browsing, but on the whole computer experience, down to how much time is allowed on the computer, what age rated games may be played, which websites can be visited.

I tried out Windows Movie Maker and it is very nice, but my camcorder records in mp4 format; and Windows Movie Maker doesn't support that.  Wish it would.  I rather like what I saw.  Movie making is quick and easy, easier than my Cyberlink DVD Suite.

Overall, Windows Vista is easy to use and has some terrific new features, like parental controls and the sidebar, but some compatibility issues still need to be worked out.  The Movie Maker has potential; but I just can't use it easily, because it doesn't support mp4 files.  I recommend waiting, if you are buying Vista as an upgrade.

App Performance: A+
VM states suspend and resume seamlessly and quickly.

Windows Performance:A+
The windows users in my office are using fairly new PCs and laptops, but with crappy graphics cards.  My Macbook Pro (early 2007 version) runs windows ""faster"" than any version of windows in the office.  Is it really faster?  There's no way to know without running benchmarks, but it seems faster, and that's something.

Interface: A -
Accessibility to Windows and Windows apps is simple, as are installation and configuration utilities.  Windows apps are still bound to a single screen when using spaces - even in 'unity' mode.  This is a major gripe I have with VMs in general, as I use multiple work spaces.  For those who use a single screen, or who run the VM in a dedicate screen 'space', this isn't a problem.  It keeps me out of 'unity' mode and in full screen though.

Mac/PC sharing: A
Your home folder on your Mac shows up as an attached drive (Z:), making navigation to mac directories and files simple and easy (and fast!)

Networking: A+
Fast networking, with setup so easy I almost forgot to review it :-)
Overall: A+

Details:

I'm a long-time Windows-on-Mac user, starting back in the day of Virtual PC, and most recently using Parallels (I currently use Parallels v3.0).  I want to start this review by saying that, for many casual PC users looking to run Windows on a Mac, there probably isn't a need -- most everything I do day to day (at work and home) can be done on either OS, and if you own mac hardware, you'll be happier running Mac apps as well.  UNLESS you have that ""one application"" that isn't supported natively.

In my office, we:
1. use Microsoft exchange for email and scheduling, and so I needed to run Windows
2. use one of those large printer/copier/scanner/collating/faxing monstrosities, and it lacks a working mac driver

Of course, there's a slew of word and powerpoint files to deal with as well, but these can be handled with Office for Mac or OpenOffice.  Of course, once running Windows anyway for the two reasons above, I prefer to use native Office apps, because that way I'm 100% the files will be compatible (and plus, I end up having to open them on the Windows side to print them anyway).

My initial impressions of VMware Fusion 2 were very positive.  It was easy to install, and the interface is very clean.  While it's not 100% fair to compare VMware Fusion 2 to the older version of Parallels 3.0 in terms of performance, it is fair to compare things like interface and usability -- and in these areas, VMware wins, in my opinion.  I'll give the blanket caveat up front: Parallels may have fixed some of these things in newer versions ... I'll try to get a copy of Parallels v4.0 and do a follow-up review.

VMware's 'unity' puts windows apps side by side with Mac apps (much like Parallel's 'Coherence').  When in 'unity' mode, you have the option to show the windows task bar, which plunks the ugly windows bar behind the Mac's dock.  My dock fills the center 70% of my screen, so the Start Menu and the goofy windows tool tray are nice and visible on the far-left and far-right of the screen.  However, because I use virtual screens (Mac's ""spaces"" feature), and because VMware is bound to one of those screens, I run in full-screen mode -- if I have to switch spaces to get to my PC apps anyway, I don't want the ugly conflict between taskbar & dock.

Networking was so clean I almost forgot to include it in this review: it just worked, piggy-backing my Mac's network connections without requiring any action on my part.  Digging in, it offers direct network connections as well as private networking (the PC is only available to the Mac).  Nice options, but what's even nicer is I didn't even notice they were there.

Performance is amazing for a VM ... even before enabling access to both processors and boosting the default 512MB of memory to 1GB.  The only slow-down on the Mac side occurs during a windows boot (or re-boot as is more often the case) ... otherwise, Windows can sit, used or ignored, running on the mac without any noticeable performance degradation to Mac apps.",Windows Under Glass,1227225600,81,

People either love it or hate it. Or really hate it and prefer Mac OS X. Each to their own is what I say and nobody is ever going to make everyone happy.
As for me, it took me a long time to learn to cope with the slightly schizophrenic nature of the OS, with the modern and classic desktops only sort of co-existing. I work almost exclusively in classic desktop mode, but am finding myself using the modern UI more and more when I'm browsing around, looking at news, etc. Now if they took away the classic desktop, I wouldn't be at all happy.
The biggest change for me in 8.1 is allowing you to configure the computer to start up in classic desktop mode. That's a big time saver. I really didn't care about, or miss the Start Button that much (OK, full disclosure, maybe a little!).
The thing is that for me, this is a rock solid, stable and fast OS that does everything that I need it to do and does it well. I've had no weird crashes, no driver problems and no sluggishness (and I work from home, so this thing is running all day). I also respect Microsoft's commitment to updating the software with the most common customer requests.

Until early 2004, I recommended NIS very highly because, when it works, it works very well. It not only keeps out viruses, it allows you to block ads and keep hackers from accessing your computer.

However, Symantec does not stand behind its products' quality and technical support is effectively nonexistent. My first experience with this was in February 2002, when I tried to renew my virus subscriptions. There was a problem and I contacted technical support but did not get an answer for a long time. When I did, the reply was 100% nonresponsive. In other words, he apologized for the delay and then simply did not answer the question. Fortunately the problem fixed itself.

The second incident was far more serious. It seemed that (as far as I could gather from other sources on the Internet) there was a Live Update that slowed my Internet browsing capability to a crawl. Here is the reply I got to my complaint (noting that Symantec did accept payment for the virus definitions): ""William, please note that Symantec no longer provides interactive support for Norton 2002 and earlier versions of the Product..."" Despite subsequent attempts to get help for this problem, which was apparently created by Symantec itself, its customer service representative began to ignore my E-mails and also refused to put me in touch with a manager. Faxes, marked ""attention manager,"" to the customer service department also were ignored.

Fortunately for Symantec, the problem was finally resolved itself three or four weeks later with another Live Update (after wasting dozens of hours of my time) but I forwarded some of the correspondence to the Investor Relations department, with the name of the recalcitrant customer service representative, telling Symantec exactly why I will never buy anything from it in the future.",Technical support may as well be nonexistent,1111276800,10,

CorelDraw just keeps getting better and better, and this version is the best one yet.

I've been using CorelDraw for years, and for years my fellow digital artists have told me I need to ""upgrade"" to Adobe software. I studied computer graphics on Macs using Adobe programs at a digital-art school, but when I came home I practiced the same things using CorelDraw. There really wasn't much of a difference, except that the Adobe interface was prettier but oddly a little less intuitive.

All my friends pushed me to buy a Mac and get Adobe software. ""It's the only thing artists use,"" they said. ""We just don't use PCs. Macs are designed for creative people, and so is Adobe software.""

""But Adobe programs cost more, and you have to buy several to do the same things as one CorelDraw Suite,"" I replied. ""Some things that come standard in CorelDraw require add-ons in PhotoShop or Freehand, and that means you have to pay even more.""

They pointed out deals for students. I could get Adobe software for about half the retail cost. That made sense for something I needed, but what I already had for less than half the price of one of those programs was already fulfilling my needs. Did I really need to spend that much more to be like everyone else?

I talked to a friend who ran a graphics studio. The artists working under her all worked with Adobe programs ... and she would fix their mistakes in CorelDraw. Then I went to work at a newspaper, where I created illustrations on my PC using scanned images and CorelDraw's Photo-Paint from the CorelDraw Graphics Suite. I exported my images in PNG format, and the layout artist had no problem putting them into pages in the software on his Mac. They looked fine in the newspaper when they were printed.

So while Macs and Adobe might be the industry standard, you won't be left out in the cold if you save your money and choose not to join the crowd.

Two last things:
1. As with all graphics programs, there is a learning curve. However, if you already know one kind well, like PhotoShop, it shouldn't be too hard to adjust to another, like Photo-Paint, which is a part of this suite.

2. CorelDraw tends to try new things with odd numbered releases, so the odd numbered ones tend to be a bit buggier than the even numbered ones. It's usually best to wait for an even numbered suite before you buy.",The most bang for your buck,1271289600,4,

Not only is this an impressive, powerful suite of graphics design tools, Corel doesn't throw you under the bus as soon as you install the software.  If you're like me and don't have a single artistic bone in your body (I can't draw a straight line with a ruler), you would expect a fancy-pants software package like this to leave you dumbfounded from the start, with no clue on how to get started.  Much to their credit, Corel throws you lifelines as soon as you jump in the pool and makes a diverse set of rescue resources near at hand for you at all times.  I'm not saying you'll be a graphics design guru after a couple of hours - this is a really advanced,  powerful set of programs here - but you would have a hard time finding a piece of software with more impressive built-in support.  The first of several excellent video tutorials is available on the Welcome screen, and you can choose to have a built-in docket of usage tips available for every function you choose.  Users of previous versions of the software will have no problem recognizing the changes this upgrade brings with it, as you can choose to have every single change and addition from your previous version highlighted on the screen.  That doesn't sound like much, but it is a big help.  You also have What's New and Learning Tools readily available to you from the Welcome screen as well as from inside each of the featured programs.  Of course, you also have a complete help file available but you won't need to resort to using that very often.

As I'm sure you can tell by the price, you don't buy this program if you just want to take the redeye out of your vacation photos or create a cute little Christmas card to send to friends.  You can certainly do those things with this, but Corel Photo-Paint X4, impressive as it is, is overshadowed by the primary CorelDRAW application.  (If all you want is a powerful photo editor, I would still recommend Fireworks - my favorite - or Photoshop.)  I would like to have seen a few more built-in templates included, but CorelDRAW actually succeeds in making graphics design possible for even artistically inept folks like me.  This is one powerful program which actual graphics professionals should take to like fish to water.  Professionals may be the primary target audience for this software package, but Corel does a great job of making these powerful tools available and actually useable by anyone.

I also have to mention several additional software applications and features included in this suite deal.  Corel PowerTRACE X4 is of enormous help in turning traced bitmaps into images you can convert into editable vector images.  Corel CAPTURE X4, as you might guess, is a powerful screen capture utility.  The Bitstream Font Navigator is a comprehensive font manager that even helps you identity scanned fonts from an outside source.  You even get a Duplexing Wizard to aid you in optimizing the appearance of your document when printing two-sided copies.  Vista users will also welcome the integration of this software package with the Vista operating system, as the search and preview options by themselves should be of great convenience to them.

What about file formats and the age-old question of compatibility?  After all, the odds are that some if not many of your associates are working with different file formats in non-Corel software.  Well, Corel has worked to make CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 software as compatible as possible with other users and systems.  In this release, the list of additional new formats includes Word and Publisher 2007, AutoCAD DXF and AutoCAD DWG, and Adobe CS3.

I could go on writing paragraph after paragraph about this product, but I could never begin to describe all of its many impressive features.  Is it the best graphics design software on the market?  I don't know, as I have no experience using any comparable graphics design programs.  Even if I had, I don't think anyone short of a professional graphics designer would be able to judge the comparative pros and cons.

Plugging numbers into these programs is not hard.  Determining what numbers to plug in can still be hard.

My experience is that the built-in help behind the questions for the Federal forms is usually OK.  In the unusual areas, I am surprised at how weak the help is - it's there, but not deep.  However, the help behind the State forms is not good - it's shallow at best.

The math in these programs is always right (usually... I did find a bug one year that they quickly fixed in an update), but again, the burden is on you the user to determine what numbers to plug in or when to say ""yes"" or ""no"" during the online interview that these take you through.  In many cases, it's not hard.  But in those hard(er) areas, it can take hours researching what is really being asked.  I've found myself downloading IRS forms and instructions most years to figure out at least one question, and I would not say that my tax returns are all that complicated (I don't have a lot of the odd situations to report).

Getting 5 Federal filings with the price of the full package this year was nice, but paying $19.99 to efile a State Form still feels ridiculously too much.  And in some cases, the Forms needed to file an odd-Sate return need to be paper (they aren't all included with TaxCut), so efile does not work in those situations.  I file 3 sets of forms each year (mine and for 2 of my kids) and this year, the cost or complexities with the kids' State forms will mean paper filing for both of their State returns.

I have not contacted H&R Block for help, so I can't comment on the waiting times to get that help or on the depth of help provided over the phone or over chat (however they do it).

But all of this is still a lot easier (and fun? at least it's a challenge to overcome) for the do-it-yourself type person, than the old paper forms or in taking all the papers to their office and paying them to do it (my opinion).","Fed OK, State (WI) is shallow",1238284800,,

At first, we thought the H&R Block software was less buggy, and had less problems, although the user interface and interview portions are somewhat Spartan in their design.

Immediately after Efiling our 1040 return this evening, we noticed a glaring error in our HRB printed return.  The HRB software had calculated a lower refund that it should have - it opted to use the default option of the Itemized Deductions rather than the higher Standard Deduction, and our refund could have been $630 higher.  Put another way, nothing in the HRB software warned us to take the higher Standardized deduction and we missed the little check box as we passed through, and did not notice that the lower itemized deduction had been applied instead.

When I contacted HRB Support by phone this evening, they were apathetic, and did not seem to care about the problem I pointed out to them; about the obvious design flaw that should have been caught during the error check process at the end (as is the case with TurboTax by the way). I asked for the call to be escalated to a supervisor (Edwin) whose faux courtesy did little to soothe the pain that this is the first time EVER that we have had to file a 1040X Amended Return.  He REFUSED to ESCALATE my quality issue to the QC department and REFUSED to give me the contact number of the corporate office to report the problem we encountered, refused to have someone follow up by calling me tomorrow, and did not even provide a mailing address to write to the corporate office about an easy-to-fix problem, a problem that will cause us several extra hours of refiling the Amended 1040X return.  Also he refused to refund my purchase price or to honor their ""Maximum Refund Guarantee"" as detailed on their website.  Apparently, their guarantee is worthless, just pure marketing BS.

Bottom Line:  DONT BUY H&R BLOCK PREMIUM & BUSINESS!  They do not care about the quality of their software and they don't care about their customers either.

I assume most people know to deselect this junk before installation so I'm not knocking off any rating for the junk that Nero would like to give you.

Nero 2014 packs a lot of products into this single collection.  This can make it difficult to find the functionality that you want.  For example I figured I'd try recoding a CD to MP3s to play on my portable player, you'd think ""Nero Recode"" would do this task.  No, it doesn't, ""Recode"" says it doesn't recognize any of the files on the CD.  I managed to find under Nero Express a tab for the ""extended area"" where I found ""Save Audio Tracks"" which does this process.  There is a long hesitation as it loads the dialog box, which I assume is it going out and querying the Internet for the track name data (no option to skip this check).  People who like simplicity might like Nero as it doesn't allow you to get into all the fine details of MP3 settings (you just select from a list of 19 preset options) but people looking for a power tool may be disappointed.

The Video product worked okay.  This is one of the few products I've found which can easily and without fuss read the VOB files on DVDs (no, it doesn't break copyrighted DVDs) but it is slow (as are most tools dealing with huge amounts of video data) and unresponsive at times (if you trigger it to do something there is often no way to cancel so you just have to sit and wait unless you wish to crash the program).

Preface:
After being disappointed with Leopard 10.5 -which I also reviewed- I kept using Tiger. When finally 10.5.2 arrived I began using it. It fixes many Leopard bugs. According to some websites, at least 130 bugs have been fixed. This is important since many problems with third party software may be related to other software or to the operating system. For example, Apple is aware of problems with its Sync services and Core Image. Also, some bugs have existed for many years and have not been fixed, such as a potential bug when moving data to an external device.
Keeping these issues in mind I did a completely clean install of Leopard 10.5.2 in a brand new hard drive.
I installed Office 2008 as well as the available upgrade to 12.0.1.

First Impressions:
Some useful features have been added, such as Elements Gallery, which may be a time saver for many people. Some features have been removed, such as VBA, and this may be a deal-breaker for many people.
I'm keeping Office 2004 in a separate partition in order to use previous versions of Word and Excel.
At the same time, I can still use the new versions when I don't need the VBA features.
Lack of VBA support was announced well over a year ago, so this came as no surprise.

Starting up:
Each program took approximately 10 seconds to launch. Office seems to have a peculiar way of handling fonts, though, and launch times can be greatly effected. After installing another program that installed more fonts, and installing Extensis Fusion to manage my fonts, launch times for Office programs was approximately 150 (one hundred and fifty) seconds, instead of the original 10 (ten) seconds.
Now it takes about a minute to launch these programs. In all fairness, the slow down is partly caused by third party software.

Overall (and very brief)  impressions:
PowerPoint works with presentations that used to crash my 2004 version. The 2004 version was practically unusable for me. This was a welcome upgrade.

Excel works fine and the Elements Gallery is a good addition. It lost VBA support and the Abalysys Toolpack. I kept the 2004 version as well.

Word seems to be a solid upgrade. Some third party templates do not work with 2008, so I kept Word 2004.

Entourage works very well. I had to re-select the folders that I had set up for my rules, and re-apply categories to my folders. Syncing with Address Book always adds many duplicate contacts. Fortunately there are scripts to deal with this inconvenience. Hyperlinks still require a workaround, as mentioned by another reviewer. I would not rate Office with 1-star solely based on that issue.

Expression Media used to be called iView MediaPro, iView Multimedia, and iView many years ago. It used to be a $25 shareware program when I first used it. Eventually it became quite expensive so I never upgraded until I received this version. So far I'm happy with it. It has worked fine for cataloging thousands of fonts and pictures, and I'm entitled to a free upgrade when version 2 comes out.

Price:
There are free Office alternatives, as well as iWork. I( still prefer Microsoft Office for the most part. The only exception may be Keynote 4.
Microsoft offered a substantial discount under the names of The Technology Guarantee Program and the Super Suite Deal. Additionally, for one day they offered a $[...] rebate. So users could get the Mac Special Media Edition for approximately $[...]-$[...] with these offers.
Had it not been for the offer, I would have stayed with Office 2004. I've used Office 2008 for a few days, every day, and so far have encountered no problems.

Overall I'm satisfied with the upgrade. Support has been great, both by Microsoft and the MVP people. Search their forums and you'll find a lot of useful advise.",Interesting update to Office 2004,1205798400,62,

I am no expert in designing or programing of computers, but I have a ton of experience using computers. In today's world, you should not even think about going online without protection from viruses, or being hacked.

I am a long time user of Trend Micro's line of products, and have had nothing but the best results using their virus protection, and firewall to protect me from all threats while being online.

When Trend Micro brought out this newest version of their program, I jumped right on it. I didn't feel a need to research the product, since I trusted the company 100%. As soon as I installed this program, I regretted doing so.

First of all, it has no firewall protection at all. The company says that their program ""enhances"" the firewall available with the Windows operating system, yet refuses to give details of just how it does this. Also, many users are having trouble with lost files, and getting the program to allow known websites to be recognized as friendly.

Basically this program is a dumbed-down version of their software, giving the user less protection, and next to no control of how the program functions.

After I decided I didn't want this junk protecting me, I attempted to roll back to the older version of the program. It was a 3 hour ordeal trying to get the software to uninstall. Windows' uninstall program could not get rid of it. Next, I tried to download an uninstall tool directly from Trend Micro, but that didn't work either. I had to purchase a copy of the older version of the program, right here on Amazon, since Trend Micro didn't offer it on their site. That copy had a ""Forced Uninstall"" tool on the CD, which finally cleaned this newer version off my computer.

Bottom line: Stay away.....very far away, from this program. If you want the best program, from my experience, go with Trend Micro's ""Internet Security Pro"" program. It's from the same company, but is a top notch program. You can get the program right here on Amazon, at a great price.","1 star, because there is no choice for zero stars!",1297814400,,

And while I find Dramatica has some good points, I find that there are some parts of this application that are just clunky. Number 1. The character creation screens and data is just terrible. For an application of this price I would expect a little more thorough approach. I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait?

I upgraded the Mac Pro from Windows 7 to Windows 8; I wouldn't consider introducing Windows 8 into my business environment (I'd have a couple hundred people staring at their screens trying to figure out how to open Outlook or Excel or Word).  The so-called Modern UI is a disaster to navigate without a touch creen (and don't tell me about keyboard shortcuts, not interested in those as a clumsy substitute for a touchscreen).  And without a touchscreen, the tiled Start page is just an unnecessary encumbrance to accessing apps, and a very, very clunky one at that.

When you first encounter Windows 8, you'll find yourself bewildered as you try to discover how to do even the things that were utterly simple in Windows 7 and previous versions of the OS.  And when you finally figure out how to do them, you'll wonder why it takes so many extra steps.

I can't imagine businesses implementing this OS on desktops (and that includes desktop replacements, especially with a large external monitor connected) unless and until Microsoft gets rid of the Start screen and reinstates the old Start menu on the desktop.

I've played with the Surface tablet, and the interface works for that, but it's a disaster on a PC...unless you're mainly interested in checking the weather and your social networking activity in a tile on the Start page (they should have called it the ""Abyss"" page).",Great for social networking; cumbersome for anything else.,1360972800,3,

I upgraded to 2012 last month, and have been using it daily to evaluate it against the previous year's release.  Since I am familiar with the Quickbooks software, I tried out some of the new features first.  I have several different accounts in my file, and 2012 includes the option to assign different accounts different functions.  I have found this extremely useful for integrating aspects of my personal account with my business account, and I think it will make things easier at tax time as well.  If you have multiple accounts, I think you will definitely enjoy this feature. Unfortunately, that is the only new feature I really could see a use for.  I found the others appeared to be thrown in for the sole purpose of being able to release a new version.  It seems like all companies are doing that now, and just trying to add in more and more bloat to force users to upgrade. I can pretty much guarantee you there will be a Quickbooks 2013, 2014, 2015, etc.  Why not just wait until you have something substantial to add before developing an upgrade?  Intuit briefly got away from this several years ago and now it seems like they're back.

The main problem I had with Quickbooks For Mac 2012 is the difference between it and the 2011 version that I previously used for Windows.  I expected the 2012 Mac version to be a mirror image of the Windows version, however there are noticeable differences and features missing. The most important to me, is that my financial institution for my personal accounts does not support it. While this would seemingly be a problem on behalf of the financial institution, when I compared the lists of support for the two systems, I noticed it is fairly significant.  Why not have an option for converting the file formats like my genealogy software has?  If there is such a thing, I could not find it anywhere.  The second thing I noticed is that several of the reports I frequently used in 2011 for Windows are completely missing in the Mac version.  I realize that there are many more X86 systems than Mac, but the lack of some of these features make Quickbooks for Mac 2012 seem more like an afterthought than a quality piece of software.

While I do feel that 2012 is a worthy buy if you are using Quickbooks 2010 and prior, I don't feel it is significant enough to warrant an upgrade, and I definitely won't be replacing my Windows version with the Mac release.","2012 is decent software, IF you have the Windows version and IF you aren't upgrading from 2011",1324425600,6,

Yes, I know others had issues related to what schedules they needed, whether they used the 2013 version and the balky response from Intuit.  No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing).

Three comments about this events:
(1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues.
(2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count).
(3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me.

And, I'm happy to report, it worked great.

I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages.

After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand.

I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment.

No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined.

I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it.

However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit).

Yes I had to use Word at school and I had to use Word at work.

But there is something about WordPerfect that draws me to it.  Admittedly the first computer I ever had came with WordPerfect and that is really what I learned to type on, but it is more then that.

The thing I find is that while WordPerfect and the other suite programs take a little bit more time to learn and understand, once you get the basic ideas ow how things are laid out, it is so much easier to to use WordPerfect, Quattro and Presentations.

Getting to the functions you want is easier, and more intuitive.  I don't find myself hunting through menus and boxes to find the changes I want to make.

Also the help functions are soooo much better.  When you do a help search on Microsoft, you basically get a web search for whatever words you entered, with WordPerfect you get actual useful answers and tutorials on how to do what you are trying to do.

Also with WordPerfect you have the option to save files directly to PDF (A Must have nowadays if you ask me) and you have a program called paperport that lets you scan in papers and convert them, a really nice program.

While I am still forced to do much of my work on Word, I find myself more and more using WordPerfect saving and then just converting the files to MS Word or excel.  A little extra work, but still easier then using the Microsoft products.

If you want to do some fun, different effects easily to your pictures, honestly, Pixelmator isn't for you.  Yes, it can do a lot of manipulation, but there is a learning curve, and to really make it fly you're going to invest hours in learning all its ins and outs.

So Pixelmator is stuck in the middle, between the free, easy, less powerful online programs and the very difficult, very powerful, very expensive programs like Photoshop.  If you want more power than what you can get from online editors and have some time to invest to learn the program, Pixelmator would be a good choice.  BUT.... I think most casual users would actually do better to stick with online editors, and most power users will want something with more horsepower like Aperture or Photoshop.

I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

It reminds me of some shareware programs that disable features until you buy the full version, but in this case you have already bought the full version and they still want to get more money from you!  I'm sort of the ""go to"" guy in my circle of friends and family when it comes to technical and/or business software and even though I would never spend a penny on this, noticed a friend had purchased this so I decided to see for myself and it only reiterated how disgusting Intuit's business practices are.  Here are a few reasons why you should avoid this program:

Payroll.  The ability to write paychecks and pay income withholdings is one of the most basic accounting tools one would expect from a ""pro"" accounting package but it is missing from this program.  Even if you do it yourself, you have to pay an extra $200 each year to have the privilege downloading tax forms and you can only shell out the extra $200 for 3 years because after spending $600 in the end of the 3 years, you'll have to buy the newest version of Quickbooks.

Again, this is for DO IT YOURSELF!  You'll print the checks on your own paper, your own computer and all they'll do is give you the tax tables.  They can easily integrate the tax tables in the software but their excuse is that it may not be up to date.  That is a complete cop-out because all they would have to do to fix that is to let you adjust the table if rates go up or down;  besides, they require you to replace the program every 3 years anyway.

They used to offer one free tax table download in the older versions but they wanted more money and they got rid of that. There IS a hidden ""manual payroll"" option, but even if you can find it past all the ads for subscriptions, they get you if you want to print the forms for the IRS.  Yes, in order to use the same IRS forms that you can download for free from the IRS, you have to pay intuit for their integrated version.

file attachments
As others have mentioned, you have to pay to save attachments to invoices in your own computer!

bloatware
What was one a simple program now install a ton of nagware that you don't want with no option to shut it off.

no easy way to export
They know they got you so they don't have any tools to convert their files to other format.

/*****************************edit**************************************************/
I give up.  Intuit using their ""customer retention managers"" to pressure amazon to delete negative reviews and comments aside, since the changing of the new social security tax rate (employee end), I can no longer print my tax forms and at the begging of my CPA, I was convinced that I have to get the new version AND since the new version doesn't let you print tax forms without subscribing to ENHANCED PAYROLL AND PAYING EXTRA FOR THE UNLIMITED EMPLOYEES, this $200 program will cost me around $500 for the first year and around $300 each following year until they force me to upgrade again.

This is a MONOPOLY.  So enjoy my money for now Intuit, you have won this round. The time will come when the DOJ hits you with an anti-trust lawsuit, FTA will come down on you for making fake positive reviews, or an enterprising software company beats you at your own game.

I wanted something that, quite frankly, made doing my books a snap -- as easy as writing a letter -- and I found it with Microsoft Accounting Professional 2008.

First off, let me state this -- if you are an average user of the Microsoft Office suite of products then Accounting 2008 is going to be a snap for you to use.  They have went to great lengths to make sure you don't need an Accounting degree to understand it.  A lot of the features not only integrate extremely well with Office 2007, but will remind you a lot of using Office (minus the ribbon interface).

One of the really nice features of Accounting is the ability to add third-party add-ins.  Out of the box you get an integration module for Paypal, so your invoices can automatically generate Paypal requests and Accounting can automatically classify and deduct the fees for it from the appropriate accounts.  As your business grows, and you decide that you need to do direct credit card processing, Accounting 2008 lets you integrate with CC processors directly -- again, handling managing the costs and fees for you.

Dashboards are another strong feature of this product.  How is my business doing?  What is my accounts payable looking like?  How much cash do I have on hand?  All that information and more is available through quick, convenient dashboards.  You can drill down into the dashboards to pull up reports to see more detailed data.

If you use Business Contact Manager for Outlook then you are in for a treat -- it integrates directly with Accounting to help you track not only customer information, but also communications and marketing camapaigns!  No more having to hunt and search for emails sent months ago or wondering if your marketing campaigns via e-mail are working.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with the product.  I think it has been a welcome upgrade from Peachtree and thanks to its integration with other products really brings my business into a 360-view.  I know immediately how well things are doing, what my customers are up to, and what needs my attention.

UPDATE 2/6/2012

After using this program for years I let it lapse for two months.  When my computer suddenly started taking more than 2 minutes to boot-up, I renewed my subscription ($9.99).  They downloade4d an update making it version 7.09.  The problem is it still takes me more than two minutes to boot.

Furthermore, other things I thought would be fixed was the section supposed to erase Invalid Registry Items.  It is presently identifying 82 items, and it indicates that they have been removed.  But when I check through ""More"" and ""Win-Reg"" in the program, all the items are still present.  Then when I try to delete these items, two more come up that were not included in the 82.  When I think I am erasing these items the screen shows the message that a back-up of these files has been made.  Okay, so I then have either erased them or placed them into some back-up file and have rid myself of them.  None is the case: The next time I run the program all 82 are still there.  I must ask: If the program tracks and identifies Invalid Registry Items why is it that I cannot get rid of them?  In the previous version I could get rid of this stuff by going through all these steps.

When I wrote the original Review I gave the program a CLASS 5 vote.  It is still possible that using this program is doing something beneficial.  Is it actually clearing off Temp Files, Junk Files, etc from my hard drive?  I just don't know what it is really doing.  But it is clearly evident that the program is not as good as it should be.

I click on confirm and it is supposed to erase all checked files that it has claimed to find.  I close and reopen the program and it is still there.  Then I click on the MORE and click on Win Clutter, check all boxes, and remove manually.  Same result.  Thirty one Megabytes of clutter is still there.  Next, I reboot my computer and run it again.  This time the same and also Windows Internet Junk File finds over one hundred and thirty Megabytes.  But I just restarted my computer after cleaning everything.  I had not been on the net.

The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.
This is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. ""Scarlet Hand"" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and ""Scarlet Hand"" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey. Not just for kids, ""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"" is an intelligent, gorgeous mystery with Mexican flavour and intrigue.",&iexcl;Bienvenido al mundo de los maya!,1057795200,15,

MORE FEATURES

OpenOffice worked well for me for basic writing, however it did not give me enough features, graphics, templates, etc.  The ""wow factor"" from my papers, graphs and slideshows was clearly missing.  WordPerfect Office gives me the ""wow factor"" that I was missing.

BEST LAYOUT

I love the clean modern layout of WordPress.  OpenOffice is clearly outdated and very basic.  OpenOffice looks like Microsoft Word 97!  The new Microsoft Office layout is horrible.  Microsoft went with large icons and mixed up their tried-and-true menu structure - a big mistake in my opinion.  Of all 3, WordPerfect is the clear winner in layout.

BETTER VALUE

For under $100 you get a lifetime of use of this software.  Microsoft Office charges you $100 per year!  Based on Corel's history, I doubt they will ever turn off my software - unlike Microsoft.

OpenOffice is of course free to use.  I have used it for years and it is great software.  If you don't need the features of a full office software suite, then go for OpenOffice.  At $0 it's the best deal.  But if you are wanting more and considering Microsoft Office or WordPerfect, WordPerfect is the better value.

I can't understand why MS would dumb down their product. Also, the street names seem to have been dumbed down as well. For example, Golden Eagle Ferry Road has been reduced to Ferry Road. There are innumerable examples of this dumbing down and simpifying which only serves to confuse.

The good news: The GPS functionality has been vastly improved with voice and large visual prompts which make using the program in an automobile MUCH MUCH easier. The little car cursor in the 2005 version has been replaced by a much more visible circle with a large arrow in it indicating direction.

Despite the dumbing down of the actual map data the program remains a superb mapping program with many updates since the 2004 and 2005 versions. New streets, restaurants and other points of interest are now incorporated. This program offers a truly affordable GPS guidance system for nearly all consumers without having to go to the expensive Garmin or Magellan systems. If you find yourself traveling to points unknown I cannot imagine a better solution for getting around than this product in conjunction with your notebook.

A few comments about the Streets and Trips mapping software. I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.

One problem I had, and hopefully this will help others who might encounter the same problem: Downloading the software into your computer does NOT automatically load the drivers for the GPS locator device! This must be done separately with the Setup disk when you first attach the locator device. Should you fail to put the Setup disk in and let your computer find the driver automatically ON THAT DISK, then your program will not recognize the locator! I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure out what was wrong. If you don't add the drivers manually your device manager will automatically load drivers that will not be recognized by the program! I had to go into my Device Manager and uninstall the drivers that were added and then manually install the MS drivers for the GPS locator. Not an insurmountable problem, but it does require a bit of experience with computers.

The included driver software turns your USB port into a pseudo-serial communication port enabling the software to recognize the locator (only serial ports are recognized by the software). The software will not recognize the locator UNLESS it is attached to a serial (or in this case pseudo-serial) communications port. So be careful and follow the installation instructions closely. The locator is made by Pharos GPS and if you have any installation problems go to their web site for further instructions.

But which one is still up in the air. The good news with most (including this one)? You can try it first.

It includes all the functionality that you may be used to with well known products (like one of my favorites Lookout Mobile Security) but also includes some stuff that those products usually dont.

Included:
+Antivirus, antispam, antispyware
+webpage blocking, phishing link alerts, (and really cool) antiphishing in texts (this is something we don't think of much but is a huge driver for exploit. We get a link in a text and don't worry too much about clicking it. That's an error. This app is supposed to stop that link.)
+High performance, low impact to data/ram/battery (I can tell you I had it running for an hour on a Galaxy S3 and checked battery usage and it wasn't even on the page of top users. The page ended at 2% so this app didn't even use 2% of the battery after an hour. That's pretty good. You will have to download an update the first time and it make bounce usage up to about 40 MB.)
+Anti-theft location, block, erase, mugshot (this is very similar to a host of other resources like Lookout, AVG, Norton, etc where you can remotely track your device using GPS, take pics of your thief through the front facing camera, and lock/ wipe your phone and CD card and even if your thief has changed SIMs which is a nice feature. Don't get too caught up on the GPS location as it isn't always acurate and you shouldn't go knocking on doors of unsavory people anyway. Just tell your local police department. I've used this to find phones that were misplaced. Once I found a phone that was in my home by locating it near my home on the map - so I knew it wasn't where I had just been. Another time I located it at a school so checked the field where we just were. Not exact but helps.)
+Call and text filtering (this is nice and brings Android in to the same level of control as iOS and Windows Phone 8 so you can block on a per call/ text basis)
+Privacy protection (I haven't used this yet. I guess if you have an unlocked phone and don't want people to see some stuff you can hide apps/ info if you hand the phone to them. I lock my phone so it's not necessary.)

This also means that the online storage place called ""OneDrive"" (formerly known as ""SkyDrive"") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.

It's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.

This package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.

Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (""the Cloud"", a.k.a., ""on the Internet"") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the ""Kanban"" look that you also see in Windows 8's ""Metro-now-called-Modern"" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.

My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.

You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose ""Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.

The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.
The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.
The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.

Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or ""bonus feature"" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.",Times have changed,1446076800,39,

Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.

Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.

Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge.

Posting to Facebook and Flickr only gives you access to some of the features on those sites. You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.

If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos. I found this out the hard way as a spent a lot of time setting up manual Ken Burns effects so that they would pan from one particular area of a photograph to another. Now the only way a can access them is to boot back and forth between my old hard drive. It is a good thing I happen to have two drives in my machine or I would have to recreate them.

This version is best suited for a company to apply to its employees' desktops, or for a home user who regularly uses their machine to connect to their company network.  This is the purpose for the Domain Join feature that is missing in Windows 7 Home:  most personal home networks are not architected and managed via Active Directory and a Domain Forest, for example.

While some home users may want to purchase Windows 7 Professional in order to use ""Windows XP Mode"", you should be advised that this mode will only operate on hardware that is new enough that it can support ""Virtualization Technology"":  without this requirement, you will not be able to use the ""Windows XP Mode"" feature.  Thankfully, Windows XP Mode is also not the same as ""XP Compatibility Mode"" - you can still use Compatibility Mode in all versions of Windows 7.  What XP Mode does is create a virtual machine that runs XP under the covers within your Windows 7 environment.  As a result, it is more recommended for cantankerous programs (say, running Office 2000) than it is for 3D gaming:  you are running a machine OS within a machine OS and this does affect performance.

The third feature added to Windows 7 Professional is the ability to make backups of your system.  This is a useful feature, especially for a business that has multiple users to manage--but for the home user this can also be done with free, easy-to-use tools such as Macrium Reflect.

Some very important things you need to know about upgrading:

1) There are two types of upgrade:  ""in-place"" (where a Vista machine upgrades to 7 and you get to keep all your programs) and ""clean"" (where you lose all your old programs and settings).
2) Anyone going from XP to 7 will have to go ""clean"".
3) Anyone going from a different Vista to 7 (for example, Vista Home up to 7 Pro, or Vista Ultimate down to 7 Pro) will also have to go ""clean"".

If you have to do 2) or 3), all is not lost--I'll explain in a moment.

Before you even buy 7 for your machine, stop by Microsoft's website for two things:

a) download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.  Run it with every device connected to the machine that you'll ever want to use in 7.  It'll thoroughly examine your machine for any roadblocks and give you good advice about upgrading.
b) Go to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center and double-check anything that came up negative in the Upgrade Advisor (or didn't show up at all).  This site lists detailed compatibility info on a LOT of different devices.

Anything major, like a video card or sound card driver, I'd recommend also checking via the manufacturer's website to be sure a driver is available for it (and go ahead and download the driver while you're there).  This almost burned me on two of the machines that I upgraded.

c) Last, make a backup.  The free tool mentioned earlier (called Macrium Reflect) can do this for you.

Do you have to do a ""clean"" install, but just want to carry over your user accounts and settings?  Microsoft makes a program called Windows Easy Transfer that's already in Vista (and can be downloaded from Microsoft for XP) that will export your accounts and settings and let you import them back again.  It's very easy to use and does a good job of putting your accounts back together again, even going from XP to 7.

Do you have to do the ""clean"" install, and you don't want to reinstall all your programs?  Laplink has an offer ($19.95 to download from them, $9.95 as a boxed product here) that will let you use a special version of their program ""PC Mover"" to upgrade one machine one time.  Read the documentation in detail because there is a specific order in which you have to perform the steps for it to work.

The most important thing to doing a ""clean"" install is that in the Upgrade setup you choose ""Custom"".  Windows will take all of your major files and place them in a folder called ""Windows.old"".  PC Mover and the Easy Transfer program both rely on this folder to reconstruct your system from, so this is VERY important.

I wish I had more space to go into detail here...bottom line is, Windows 7 Professional makes sense for those needing to manage complex networks or run older programs that might not work in Windows 7.  However, the average Home user will do just fine with Windows 7 Home:  it's not as stripped-down as it was in the days of XP.

If you plan ahead a bit, upgrading to 7 will go very easily (and if it doesn't, you'll have something to fall back on).",Important to Prepare First,1257033600,2,

I have decided to go about it from the perspective of what I am using it for and a brief history of my experiences and exposure to Painter.

MY COMPUTER
Here are my specs

Intel Core i5 CPU 650 @ 3.20 GHz
Memory 6GB
OS- Windows 7 64bit
Input- mousepad and Intous 5 from Wacom

BRIEF HISTORY

I had the original Painter from Fractal Design back when it was amazing and a challenge to use,
but it put me ahead in light years for my artistry.  I have not only done graphic arts, but I am
a fine artist.  My primary use for Painter at the time was to use it for throwing ideas up
into the screen and trying out alternative colors and textures for my paintings.

Sometimes I would scan in my paintings or take a photo if the painting was too big and use
the program to test out ideas.  I even would do this for using it for very tiny details- the kind
that could greatly ruin a painting should I put it in the wrong place.

I work in watercolor primarily so I need something like this to test out ideas as watercolor is something
you can not retract once you have done it.  That can be highly frustrating when you have worked a long
while on a painting and you ruin it by doing one small thing at the end.

Painter helps me to avoid this kind of frustration.  For this, it has been a delightful tool.

I used to have the ArtZII pen and graphics tablet, but due to some awful driver issues, it suddenly
stopped working with Windows XP.  That meant that the Painter X that I had purchased was pretty much
useless to me and I never got to explore the program.  I could not afford another pen and using a mouse
was far too frustrating.

The old Painter was nice.  It gave the idea of doing artwork on the computer, but there was still a gap
between real time artist tools and what was in the program.  Still it was useful and I used it constantly
until my Wacom graphics tablet stopped working.

EXPERIENCE OF PAINTER X3

Since it has been some years since I have had the chance to use Painter, I have forgotten all of the wonderful
things it can do.

I now have the Intuos 5 Touch Graphic Tablet (Medium) from Wacom and let me tell you this program is so overwhelming
I feel as if I might drown there is so much in it.

When you first enter the program, there is an opportunity to get some training on using Painter X3.
You can opt into the training from the initial screen.  This will give you an option to go to the extensive
help files or go online to learn how to use Painter X3 for whatever your penchant is.

There are tutorials for Fine Arts, Illustrating, Photo Art, and Painter Interface.  Beyond that, there are
tutorials for doing specific art pieces provided by a variety of artists.  Some are for previous versions of
Painter, but they still apply.

HOW THE PROGRAM INTERACTS WITH INTUOUS 5

I am a bit overwhelmed with this program.  Not only am I dealing with all of the amazing improvements of the program
since I used to use it constantly, but the Intuos 5 is another whole breed of graphics pads.  Painter is designed
to work with the Intuos 5 graphics tablet, so you can do just about anything with it.

I love that when I am working with the pad you can zoom in or out just by using your fingers to expand or contract
the paper.  This can be turned off, incidentally.  You can turn the paper to just about any angle you like with your
fingers as well so the art creation experience is much more realistic.

There is a seemingly endless series of brush strokes and nuances that this pen and tablet capture that are very close
to duplicating the real life art experience.  There is the ability to take a thick line and draw it down to almost imperceptible
line that fades to a point just like in real life.

The new jitter brush enhancement to this program is delightful.  It more closely duplicates the way that paint or other media will
not be uniform no matter how much you have a steady hand.

SOME NEW THINGS THAT IMPRESS ME

The Jitter brush is one of the new features, and there is a brush search.  You can search based upon what you want- if you want only brushes that will jitter, then you can narrow it down by that.  I have not had any problems with this feature yet, but as I continue to use it over time, I will update.

There is a way to view an inspirational reference image while you keep focus on your current work. You can independently change the view of the docked panel without changing your work space or changing focus from it.

You can also control the minimum values of brushes like size or opacity.  Also, you have some bit of control of the settings of the jitter brushes.  I have not had a huge amount of interaction with this to find the bugs yet, but it sure is interesting to mess with.

Perspective guides are amazing to me- they are lines that appear so you can use them as guides when putting perspective in your painting or work.

There is also an ability to go back and forth between a clone image- you can apply some changes to the original piece that you are cloning as well as the work you are cloning to- going back and forth between them.

I have not been able to truly explore the layer application but now you can apply changes to layers simultaneously.  The small projects I tested it on worked well- again I have not come across bugs yet.

FINAL COMMENTS

I have to say that this Painter X3 release is so packed full of goodies that I can not even begin to rave as much as I want to in this limited space.  Using it with the Intuos graphics pad makes it so delightful that I am like a kid in a candy store with unlimited budget!

There are some frustrations with the Intuos- using this sometimes is a bit frustrating- the paper will go a bit too far left or right, or become too small or big and I have to mess with it, but I am not sure if this is the software in Painter, the Intuos 5 physically, or a combination of both.

There is so much in this program that I want to comment on but I will update this review as I have the chance to explore it more in depth.  I am truly impressed with it so far.  I am not naive, however.  Programs will have bugs or limitations in them and it is just a matter of time before I encounter one.  However, at this time, it is pretty solid in performance and I love using it.

WHO WOULD LIKE THIS PROGRAM?

--If you are a graphic artist who tends to want to do more ornate graphics, backgrounds or illustrations, you would most likely like this program.

--If you are a fine artist who wants to test out designs before you paint them, you will definitely like this.

--If you are a photo person who likes to dress up photos in a more artistic way, you will like this.

--If you have access to a decent computer with the ability to get a graphics pad, you will probably like this, especially if it is the Wacom Intuos 5

WHO WOULD PROBABLY NOT LIKE THIS?

--If you have an older computer and graphics pad, you might not like this.  It takes some power to use. (Go bigger than minimum system requirements)

--If you are a dabbler, you will probably not like this program.  They do have a lighter version that might be better

--If you the type of person who has to feel the texture of the paper below your hand and experience the smells and performance of real media, you probably won't like this program.  Many of the artists I tried to talk into trying it, refuse for those reasons.

All in all, at this time, I highly recommend this program to any artist who loves the arts, anything that is geared toward working with natural media (pen and ink, spraying, painting, markers, watercolor, etc).  If you are delighted at being creative this program will give you more than you will probably ever use, but you will have a lot of freedom to create.

If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos. I found this out the hard way as a spent a lot of time setting up manual Ken Burns effects so that they would pan from one particular area of a photograph to another. Now the only way a can access them is to boot back and forth between my old hard drive. It is a good thing I happen to have two drives in my machine or I would have to recreate them. I imagine this is what you would have to do if you had a laptop.

The recent area on the sidebar only shows the last event you look at. This is ok but I would like to see a history of the last several events I viewed.

[These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]

For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You ""have"" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.

* Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.

* Took forever to figure out how to turn off a ""reminder"" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be
paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.

*You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.

* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.

* You can't turn off the ""free update/revision"" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.

* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.

* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.

* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.

* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.

Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.

If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.

[Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.

[Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating ""We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..."" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.

[Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.

[Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message ""You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment."" Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the ""Ignore"" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.

[Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for ""how many times"" from ""unlimited"" to ""1."" In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.

[Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.

[Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.

[Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]

[Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.

[Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.

[Update: January 17, 2010] Repeating payment to my HOA increasing by four bucks a month. Learned already the hard way that if you change it by just increasing the payment, it doesn't take. So I first deleted the existing repeating payment entirely (but not the existing payee). Logged onto the bank. Deletion occurred properly. THEN I tried to create a new repeating payment (using the existing payee). Enter all the information - and nothing happens. Just like I never entered it at all. Rebooting, log on to the bank again, no change. So I created a new payee (with slightly different spellings for payee name and account number since those fields define the unique payee). Creation took place properly - after every desktop icon on screen flashed on and off screen for nearly a minute. Logged on to bank to let Quicken advise of new payee. THEN created new payment using the tweaked, new payee. Logged on again. More icon flashing in process. New repeating payment now appears in register. Although it has NOT always done so in the past, THIS TIME Quicken let me delete the old payee. For users that can't figure out these kinds of workarounds, the simple, everyday-routine, core process of adjusting the amount of a repeating payment simply doesn't work. It USED to work in older versions of Quicken, so I can only assume Quicken programmers spend their lazy afternoons destroying old code and functionality - instead of writing new code to fix known bugs.

[Update: January 26, 2010] The above described payment (at four bucks more) was made successfully to the HOA yesterday. In the Quicken Bill Reminder Tray it says I have FOUR payments missing - all to the HOA, all at the new 'four bucks more' amount, two of them due yesterday and two of them due today. As always when this tray incorrectly reports overdue payments, the tray's three choices are Enter, Edit and Skip. Which one would you dare use to try to get the stuff to disappear? If you choose Skip, will it take the payment back? Maybe in the mirror-image BizarroWorld that is Quicken software.

[Update: July 25, 2010] Used a certain credit card last month (that hadn't been used otherwise in about eight months). The account had been live and retrieving transactions without incident for years. The account password is saved in Quicken so that it can do so. But guess what, those new transactions did not retrieve after multiple log-ons (using Quicken's ""one-step update"" which logs on to all active accounts in a single pass). Quicken reflects the account as active for transaction retrieval, everything AOK. Quicken also reflects the connection took place with the account without error. If I didn't KNOW I had transactions not retrieved, I wouldn't have had the least idea there was an error. Not that Quicken would give me the least indication to do so, I went ahead and tried solving the error by re-running the account through the 'online initialization' process again. It worked. The transactions then retrieved normally. HOWEVER the NEXT time I tried to run through the logon/retrieval process, Quicken demanded I provide the account's password. That would be the very same password it had in storage to begin with - and that I JUST provided to Quicken a SECOND time when I did the re-initialization. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Also, after the re-initialization, I started getting a message that claims 'your last update attempt was not successful, do you want to re-try?"" I figure that erroneous message will resolve itself after enough time has eroded since 'my last update attempt.'

[Update: August 8, 2010] I wanted to change the amount for a repeating payment (the equal pay plan for my utility bill was adjusted), so I used the `change' function. Kick me in the *** because (1) using the obviously correct approach in Quicken often means trouble and (2) I've tried this before and it's a major fail. I opened the repeating payment, changed the amount and clicked the OK button. As I was signing on, Quicken advised it would be changing the payment amount just exactly as I had entered it. Result: both payments, old and new, are in the register. I marked the old payment for deletion and re-connected to the bank. The bank generated an error message stating that the old payment had already been cancelled. I tried deleting the old payment from my register and it won't budge. It demands that I must log on in order to complete the deletion. As I just said, when I logged on the bank refused to recognize the deletion request.

OK. I have a new plan for opening a can of whoop@ss on Quicken's demons. I will delete the NEW payment, then delete the payee entirely. Then Quicken will HAVE to let go of the old payment, right? Then I will re-create the payee. I marked the new payment for deletion and logged on. It WAS deleted at both the bank AND in the Quicken register. But when I try to delete the payee, Quicken says ""cannot delete payee for which there are repeating online payments scheduled."" Go to the screen that lists all the repeating payments. Nothing there. Go back to the register. The old payment is still there. The old payment that refuses to be deleted until it yaks with the bank ... too bad the bank says it's already deleted and won't yak. Totally screwed by Quicken again.

Eventually I discover via Googling that Quicken has an undocumented save posted in their support blogs - to use CTRL to force the deletion of the old payment. It works. I suppose that's worth half-a-point. OK, now let's put the new payment back (like it was before I deleted it). I enter all the information, click OK. Nothing happens. Acts like I entered nothing at all. Try it three times, zippo. I look in the list of repeating payments. I look in the transactions pending for transmission. I look in the register. Nothing. Unfortunately I've been here before. This entire process has ""imploded"" the payee, making it unusable.  I'll have to create an entirely new payee. I go to delete the old payee. It won't let me. It STILL insists I have repeating payments outstanding against it. Whattaeffing piece of software cr@pola.

I already have two other old payees I can't delete that act just like this ... even though they haven't been involved any kind of payment in at least a year. Quicken says in that same support blog webpage that using the CTRL key also forces payee deletions. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't get rid of it. (You can see these kinds of problems also discussed earlier in this review.) I will have to put a space or something in the account number to create a brand new payee, since that account number has already been ""used"" and Quicken won't let me re-use it. And I am stuck with another old payee I can't delete.

Oh, and down in my tab titled ""Scheduled Bills & Deposits Due"" I still  (as described above) have listed FOUR TIMES my monthly HOA payment, as being overdue from 13 days ago. (It's a repeating monthly payment set up in Quicken months ago, and it was already paid on schedule.) The four listings are actually two pairs of amounts, each pair one day apart. All of these are artifacts from where I tried to adjust that repeating payment amount when I experienced an increase. The three choices are ""enter"" ""edit"" or ""skip"" I've learned to wait until well after the bill is actually paid, then enter ""skip."" Otherwise it may well try to pay twice. (I've already described this particular bug up above ... just a reminder, it never goes away.) Bottom line:  since about 2005, the Quicken product has become totally effed up.

I am now about six months now from the next cycle of Quicken's ""sunset policy."" Every three years, you have to pay for the Quicken upgrade or they cut off your ability to download transactions from your financial institutions (Quicken servers are the `middle man"" between your software and the institutions). Maybe it's time to migrate to competing software product that works right, only has to be bought once ... and connects directly to my institution to collect unadulterated data!

[UPDATE: August 14, 2010] FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST !! After that last fiasco, I decided why invest more time trying to solve the Quicken problem ... when I could invest that time migrating to Moneydance 2010.

Moneydance, what a dream come true! And much less painful a migration that I imagined. Just buy the license at the website first, then download&install the product. Here's a couple of key points I learned (the hard way) that should make your migration run smooth as silk:

* Export the data from Quicken using the ""all accounts' option (not one account at a time). I had to look for it but that choice WAS in the Quicken drop-down list.

* When importing IGNORE any advice Moneydance offers that you ought check the ""Import account info only"" option (ie, to import the structure/tables/fieldnames first, then to go back and re-do the procedure to get the data records). When I followed that advice, I had all sorts of screwy issues, records landing every which way. When I DID NOT check the box (in essence asking Moneydance to import everything in one fell swoop - both records & structure/tables/fieldnames for all of the Quicken accounts) everything dropped right into place, ready to roll. The only record that did not import correctly (and I had ten years of records over about fifteen accounts) was the ""original transfer balance in"" for one account.

After that I did have to do some minor clean-up for a while - entering stock symbols, entering the names I wanted to use for the accounts, other account details such as my credit card numbers. To make the stock prices update in real time (for some reason) you have to manually add-in two developer extensions. Easy to do (so long as you realize that you have to do it) and the user's guide explains how exactly. Quick and no glitches.

Moneydance swims slick as an eel. Downloading of records only takes three or four seconds at most. With Quicken it took a lot longer. Moneydance is connecting direct to the institution; Quicken is running you through its own server as an intermediary. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that a lot of my earlier issues (such as missing or duplicate records) that I did NOT post in my reviews (since I did not attribute them to Quicken) turn out to disappear. Because they were being CAUSED by Quicken's intermediary server. We'll see.

The online banking download setup was easy, but there were the most minor of issues. Moneydance did not have any idea of course when the last download was done (with Quicken), so it retrieved all the available records at the institutions. (Be smart and bring your Quicken accounts and downloads totally current and as reconciled as possible BEFORE you export them.) Also, where I had multiple accounts at one institution, it got confused first go-round, mixing them all up - and changing the account numbers in the setup parameters. I just deleted all the downloaded records and went back and re-entered the correct account numbers. After adjusting that first 'initializing' download for each account, no problems.

I haven't started using the 'setup payments through Moneydance' feature yet. My bet it'll be easy.

While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.

Being a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:

Story: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.

Graphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.

Characters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.

Puzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.

Activities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.

Ending: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.

Total (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....

However, I had many issues with the software (I will give examples below), support for problems is practically non existent (help only from the forums where other people are having the same issues)  and when the crash happened I had very little hope that it would work. But it did.  I now switched to a different back up method.

When I bought this software, I wanted to have a backup history of about a month so I can go back to the old files if I made some sort of mistake.  My hope was to run a full back up once a week, and then have differential backs 6 times a week, this way I could fit 7 different backups on a large disk designated for backups.  The software claims to have a function that allows it to delete old backups based on a condition (% of disk full for example).  But that never worked. Many other people complained about the same problem.  When the disk became full, it simply stopped backing up.  I had to remember to manually free up disk.

Then I upgraded to a next version of the software which was supposed to have these problems fixed.  However, the fix was to remove the functionality and what I wanted to do was not possible.  The new version still had problems with incremental backups at disk full situation.  In fact I left it double the amount of space necessary for one backup (as the forums indicated it needs temporary space while the backup is working).  Finally, the only solution that worked was to have a full back up every day, with a rule that the previous copy had to be deleted before the new backup was created.  Occasionally, it would still fail with messages that made no sense at all.  I could get it to work again sometimes, if I deleted several backups and ran disk defragmenter. But this did not always help.  And then in a few days it would begin working again.  So it felt fragile and unreliable.

As I was having various issues I contacted support several times (support is via email), they would get back to me in 2-3 weeks requesting some additional log file, to which they would respond maybe in another 2-3 weeks.  By then whatever they said was not relevant, because I could not just wait for 4-6 weeks for a possibly helpful response. I would just wipe out the backups and start all over.

Because the regular backups felt flakey, I also created ""secure zone"" back up, which is an option to have a backup on a separate partion.  When the disk crashed, restore from secure zone did not work.

So overall, using it was a very frustrating experience which was shared by a large number of other users based on the forum postings.  The forum was the only place where I could get ideas of for possible solutions, and validation that the problems I was having were not unique to me.

However there are some positive things about the product
1.  The feature that allows you to mount a back up and easily retrieve an old file as if it was just another volume is very nice
2.  The backups are fairly quick. I tried using Windows native back up and on my disks it did not even completed in 24 hours.  Acronis backup for all my disk completed overnight (when it worked), when it did not it would sit at the prompt complaining about something with inscrutable message.
3.  Finally, when the disaster struck and my c: drive crashed, I was able to do a restore my C: drive from the backup to a brand new drive and it worked.  I did not have to reinstall windows, all my settings and customization were preserved.

Bottom line, this is only for those who have no other options.  It requires constant baby-sitting.  You need to manually check if it worked on daily basis, delete files, and  just pay constant attention to it.  But what you want from a backup is to enable it and forget it until you need it.","Bailed me out in a disaster, but needs constant baby sitting (lots of problems)",1303257600,,

So I was automatically comparing this software to what I know can be done for each type of project - which I realize is not totally fair.  So I tried to get my mindset into that of a person who is using this type of media program for the first time.

I loaded this on a Windows Vista computer and the setup process was quick and trouble-free.  There were no nags to register the software; there were no codes to enter to get the software to work.  I have Vista set to display at 120dpi (larger fonts) and I notices that there was some clipping of the columns and some missing horizontal scroll bars with that setting, so just a head's up about that if you use the large font setting in Windows.

As others have mentioned, operation of the software in intuitive - icons are the preferred method, with only a few drop-down menus.  Personally, I prefer menus on the project screens.  The software operated quickly in the functions I tried out.  I was able to make a slide show without problem.  When I tried to make a film, I noticed a glitch in the transition between one image and another at the same point, no matter which transition I used.  I don't know the cause of that problem.  A ""media converter"" is advertised, but as far as I can tell, it is only a video converter, not an audio one, because the convert function icon did not appear when I opened up my Music folder (I've got Amazon MP3's in it).  There's a nice program for creating calendar and cards; the scrapbook one had just basic themes - nothing of interest if you are a serious scrap-booker but I suppose it's an okay intro for people who've never done that before.  There's a nice assortment of color, artistic and text editing tools to introduce the novice to photo editing.  It is very easy to create the previously mentioned slide shows and movies (a number of movie formats are supported) so I think someone who had never created one before would get a kick out of that; you can also create screen-savers from your images.

You can really do a lot of things with this software, so I would recommend it for a person who wants to start playing with their image files and learning what can be done with digital images.  Amazon currently has (at the time of this review) it discounted by 40%, so that's a very good price for all of the tools you're getting. It's good entry-level software which allows the user to accomplish a lot of tasks that they might never have thought of doing before, and it does make uploading videos to Facebook, Flickr, Vimeo, etc. very easy. The caveat is that if your level of expertise is beyond that, this program isn't going to have all the dedicated bells-and-whistles that you might need and/or want.  But it is a good, basic program and one that I could see giving to my less technically-inclined friends.  For myself and my needs, I would give it three stars, but for novices to its functions I think that it would be a four-star program so that's why I gave it the rating I did.",Relatively Basic All-Purpose Tool,1297814400,,

* Easy and automatic daily backup of all your Windows computers
* Easy file sharing
* Familiar Windows GUI
* Great for non-techies but only after it's setup correctly
* Low system requirements by today's standards
* Easily add to storage by just adding drives to make one ""big pot"" of storage
* Easily set up a shared folder that duplicates files across more than one HD in case one HD fails (just toggle a setting)

Cons:
* BEWARE! When upgrading to an SSD, I found out that WHS would not restore to a smaller partition than the original. Instead, I had to use Acronis TrueImage to do this - which worked great, BTW.
* The restore disc did not detect any network interfaces on a Dell 1525 notebook... so a bit of a hassle since correct drivers would have to be found for it to restore.
* Terrible policy of having to do a ""server reinstallation"" to use an OEM key when you use the trial version. This loses all your settings and installed programs but supposedly not your data... plus you have to download and install a ton of updates (80+ as of mid Jan 2010, and then another 9 on the ""second pass""), all over again.
* Not only the above, but also had to reinstall the connector on all the machines to get the connection back to the server. Very disappointing.
* Driver problems - some drivers may be non-existent or difficult to get. I had to stick an old 10/100 Intel network card in the machine so that it could get on the Internet and get the right network drivers for my Gigabyte motherboard (Marvell Yukon 88E8056). And I had to do this TWICE because I had to do the server reinstallation.
* If you have to deal with what I did, then setup could take you a lot longer than you'd expect.
* Can't easily use a USB external drive to backup your Windows Home Server if you also want to backup the backups. I wanted to backup everything, including the backups, to a 2TB ioSafe waterproof/fireproof external USB HD but it would only backup the shares and not the backups. However, it seems this can be done manually so I created a script to copy the data directory to the external ioSafe drive and I will set this script to run weekly. Take a look at the Microsoft Technical Brief on Backup and Restore on what to do.
* No easy encryption, especially to external USB drives where you might want it more, but you might be able to use TrueCrypt to provide encryption.
* Difficulty activating even after a server reinstallation - got message number 32777 - had to fiddle with Internet Explorer settings to get it to work - see Microsoft Support Article 816897 if you have this problem too

The Test:
* I'm simulating a failure by changing out the SSD in a Gateway T-6836 with Intel T5750 CPU notebook computer running Vista x64 (changing from an OCZ 60GB Solid to a Kingston 40GB SSD that uses the Intel 2nd generation controller).
* I downloaded the latest WHS Restore CD (2009-11-23) from Microsoft and installed it. It placed a CD ISO image in the installation directory and I used the Windows Disc Image Burner tool (included in Windows 7) to burn the CD.
* I removed the old OCZ SSD from the notebook and installed the new Kingston one.
* I booted from the restore CS and it asked me if I was restoring a computer with less than 512MB of memory or 512MB or more of memory (shouldn't it be able to figure this out?) - I have more than 512MB so I chose that option.
* Looks like it booted into a version of Vista.
* It asked me about drivers - looks like all the needed drivers were already available (good) - otherwise I had the option to provide/install them.
* It looked for my Windows Home Server and found it - then asked me for the WHS password.
* It asked me what computer to restore and from which backup day. It defaulted to the correct computer.
* It asked me some questions about the restore disk and I had the option to use a ""Disk Manager"" but I didn't.
* Restore started about 2:58PM and finished (reported SUCCESSFULLY) about 3:36 PM so about 38 minutes to restore 28.7GB of used space according to the properties dialog for the C drive (The new SSD is a value SSD and has a slow sequential write speed of about 40MB/s - its biggest downside).
* FINAL RESULT: It works smoothly! I did not run into any problems that can be attributed to WHS while restoring the system. Couldn't have been much simpler.

Other:
* Based on Windows Server 2003
* Giving it 4 stars out of 5 because once it is setup, it's easy to use and works well, but the setup and activation itself was very poor.
* I installed RealVNC so I could access the desktop easily. I prefer it over the Microsoft provided solution (Remote Desktop).",Good - but room for improvement - DIFFICULT SETUP - BE WARY OF THE TRIAL VERSION,1263945600,3,
2886,2886,3.0,False,"03 27, 2008",AVBLGXSWRN666,B000WEJYM4,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},S. Jentsch,"I have been using this program on a PC with Office 2007 installed, and upgraded from Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager (BCM). Two POP3 accounts were managed, and about 100-125 business contacts were tracked. I have four years' worth of E-Mail stored, amounting to thousands of E-Mail messages.

For those contemplating an upgrade from Outlook 2003 with BCM, you should do so. BCM is a good idea, but the 2003 version (even after the service packs) were not as good as they could have been. The 2007 version is definitely an improvement in every way except speed, but I'll get to that in a moment.

The E-Mail features of Outlook 2007 are pretty good. The ability to set up rules to auto-process incoming messages is very good, much like the 2003 version. The search folders and new flagging options are very handy to make it easier to find messages according to a variety of filters/searches. The fact that you can flag a message for follow-up at a later time, and have that appear as a notification and on your to-do list is very handy. I have yet to make full use of all of those related features to the best of their potential.

Spam filtering is a weak point, but no worse than in the 2003 version. The simplified profile-based filtering with the ability to set up white lists and black lists is very basic compared to more sophisticated bayesian filtering available in other packages. I installed the SpamBayes add-on filter (freeware) which uses Bayesian filtering, and it's much more flexible in classifying spam messages. Spam filtering is so important these days, and when freeware packages do it better than a $100+ product from the likes of Microsoft, the people at Redmond should be embarrassed.

The BCM works very well. Being able to track E-Mail messages, calendar events, to-do items, and other items to customers is very cool. I've not used other contact managers, so I don't know how it compares, but it serves my needs, so I haven't looked elsewhere.

Its limited spam filtering ability is nothing compared to the speed issues encountered when incoming messages are retrieved from my two POP3 accounts. When the messages are being retrieved, Outlook stops cold. If you are typing a message, you can forget about continuing until the incoming messages are processed. It's incredibly frustrating to see a well-equipped machine brought to a halt, but that's exactly what happens. It's not a result of high CPU usage; a look at the CPU meter shows that neither processor meters is pegged when it happens.

It was really bad in 2003, and just a little better in 2007, but still not acceptable. I have tried many different things, including archiving more messages into the archive.pst file instead of the outlook.pst file, but the improvements were only minor.

Some would consider Outlook to be the embodiment of evil. As a person who came from using unix-based E-Mail (pine and elm anyone?), to PMMail for both OS/2 and Windows, I didn't have any problem getting used to Outlook and appreciating the extra features it brought to the table. Like anything, it's more often the operator behind the keyboard than the software on the computer.

Being a gamer and an artist, I wanted a good performance rig festooned with removable storage ports and cable jacks. So I picked up an HP Media Center and discovered Windows Vista.

Vista Home Premium is to Windows XP as XP was to the Windows 9x series. In other words, I think it's a leap: one of Microsoft's most radical changes in interface, capability, and security that I've experienced. And I've laid my hands on almost every Windows OS since 1992.

Enough so that I find Vista to be superfluous despite its changes. XP users in particular need not apply (an upgrade that is, yuck yuck!).  But for anybody who's looking to finally replace that trusty old copy of 98 Second Edition, or who wants to jump on the multiprocessor, dual video card, high-def graphic experience, then this is the system for you. Just beware--here there be bugs and compatibility issues.

->DOWN TO DETAILS<-

Despite all my talk about big leaps, there is nothing that Vista does that XP users can't do without. Home Premium bundles a number of apps `n' applets that XP must apply separately, but nevertheless is able to apply. Otherwise, the remaining differences are pretty looking, but pretty useless.

>Aeroplane and Horsepower

Such as a new ""glass"" interface called Aero. Everything about it, including the cute sidebar, the marble Start button, and fancy-pants window switching, windows thumbnail, and windows sizing effects--looks better than the ""Fisher Price"" XP. Or any previous version of Windows, for that matter. Vista runs simple effects, such as color-coding file names to indicate a compressed file. And more complex effects: hover the mouse pointer over a program in the taskbar, and a cute little thumbnail screenshot pops up; while hitting the ""switch window"" button in the quick launch box will stack full size pics of your open programs to sort through.

This interface is one of the shallow leaps from XP. It doesn't have much utility but it sure looks like it needs hardware to run. Except Aero ran just fine on my low-range, low powered graphics card installed by the factory: an NVIDIA OEM 7500 LE. And I have confirmed that it will run, if a bit sluggishly, on a single gig of RAM with a modest dual-core processor. Vista also comes preloaded with Direct X 10, which itself is supposed to be a revolution in graphics processing. Since I have no DX10 programs other than Vista, I can't tell you whether this matters or not.

>Stability

What might matter to the performance minded user: stability. I've only used Vista for a couple of months, but I have suffered no OS crashes or freezes. Unlike XP which, while the most stable Windows of its time, still bugged out on me at least once a month. Individual programs still crash or fail to respond--notably AOL and Word 2007. Also, closing a program sometimes triggers a ""Stopped Working"" error message, but I detect no actual harm and I can load such a program right back up. So far Vista has taken every peripheral, drive, and PC card I've thrown at it. On a down note, VHP is so big that a Norton virus scan or disk defrag takes roughly twice as long as it did in XP.

Update 15 AUG 2007: After installing my PSU and graphic card, I noticed system hangs at startup. These seem to be resolved after a recent update. Also, the aforementioned app crashes have been resolved by updates.

Now, in performance, I include the improved power options. Three pre-set states exist: from high-performance/low-savings, to a balanced system, to energy efficiency but low performance. Additionally, the low-power states of previous Windows have been combined in a newish ""Sleep"" mode. According to my documentation, putting the computer into Sleep mode is actually preferable to shutting down the system every night, presumably because Vista runs a number of maintenance programs when I am not looking. These power settings integrate with my monitor's own energy program, incidentally.

>Security

Speaking of management, Vista includes User Account Controls, which basically asks your permission every...single...time...you attempt to install a program, uninstall a program, or run any sort of program which significantly affects the performance of Windows. As an XP veteran myself, I just turn this annoying feature off, since there is currently no scalability to this control (that is, I can't order it what to watch and what to ignore). Vista also has a detailed file sharing security system, to the extent that even an Administrator account can be denied permission to move that Metallica MP3 from your Download folder to your KigAzz Musik folder. No, really, it is that buggy and intrusive.

>Bells n Whistles

Vista also comes preloaded with its own firewall, calendars, news tickers, and system monitors that XP users can separately plug in. Annoyingly, Vista itself has no CPU temperature widget--I have to go into my BIOS for that.

What I think is more useful are all the inherent, if generic, multimedia applications. Vista Home Premium supports HD DVD and HDTV. And users can access their media, including music and video files as well as television, through a Windows Media Center interface. VHP includes generic video capture capability, generic movie editing, generic DVD home movie burning, generic picture gallery, and of course, those old stalwarts, Paint and Sound Recorder (Note that the capabilities of Sound Recorder have been greatly reduced, to the point that in premium it can only record in .wma format and with no onboard editing or sound effect capability). The interface itself is reorganized to include more recognition for gamers. All of your games can be found in a dedicated tab within the Start menu.

Speaking of gamers, Vista is supposed to support games in other ways as well. There's the new Games for Windows protocol, which I really don't know much about, in addition to the graphics support. DX10, incidentally, includes a number of back-compatible Direct3D APIs to support XP-era programs. Games like *Oblivion* run like a dream, while the infamous audio stutter bug of *Half-Life 2* is actually worse than on my XP rig.

Keep in mind also that many new hardware devices still support XP. My new NIVIDA 8600 GTS, for example, includes DX9.0c and supports such systems, even though it is a DX10 card.

->SEND OUT THE BUGS<-

Unfortunately, none of this seems to be enough for *Max Payne* and *Max Payne 2*, which I have been unable to get going on VHP. And that leads me to the compatibility issues. The Windows Upgrade Advisor utility isn't entirely accurate about what software will run well in Vista. I had to replace all of my Norton Software, and I was disgusted to discover that the 2007 edition of SystemWorks still wasn't Vista compatible! And yet, my ancient copy of Adobe Photoshop LE 5.0 functions well enough. My old Canon Zoombrowser has some graphic issues with the buttons, but the pictures themselves appear just fine.

Not so fine are some media limitations. Home Premium includes Windows Media Player 11. This program will write album tags to newly ripped .WAV files. However, old .WAV files cannot be tagged, and will be permanently lumped together under the ""Unknown Album"" section. Because officially, WMP 11 does not support metadata for WAV, just .wma and MP3. Even though it can write in .WAV format. That's just stupid.

Plus, I hate the fact that burning a CD in WMP continues to automatically insert a pause between tracks. Apparently, Bill Gates has never heard a music album that segues, such as almost everything ever published by Frank Zappa and Trent Reznor.

VHP also has some bug issues. As confirmed on the Microsoft support site, wakening the computer from a low-power state causes digital audio drivers to malfunction. In my case, it fills my speakers with static. Three Windows Updates, including the newest one posted on 10 July 2007, have not solved this problem. I found two solutions on my own:

*I can reboot, which is annoying whenever I need to get back on the computer after an absence, such as sleeping, eating, and otherwise living my life.

*Or I can stop using digital audio altogether. Specifically by running analog cables from the speaker outputs of my computer to the multichannel inputs of my receiver, and then telling my computer's sound manager to run speaker audio as the default device. Since *Half-Life 2* only supports analog surround sound anyways, this is no real loss. Except I think it is stupid that a game will happily use stereo cables to support my 5.1 setup, but refuses to use my digital cable for anything except stereo!

->THE BOTTOM LINE<-

Vista is ideal for some and excessive for others.

XP with SP2 is still a current and capable OS, with a third service pack on the way. Microsoft will continue mainstream support until about 2009. So after spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on XP compatible software, you might as well get your money's worth and keep using it. Especially since Vista's successor is already in the works, XP users can safely wait a couple more years.

This is true even for security-minded users. The new account restrictions are appropriate for an actual network that can be accessed by multiple people. You will still need a third party anti-virus and spyware program. For everybody else, XP with Service Pack 2 and regular updates will protect your Jenna Jameson pics and household budgets just fine.

Likewise, those who are serious about media will not need Vista's limited programs. You `ll be looking for more capable products from third party vendors, such as Nero, Paint Shop Pro, or Final Cut. Bleeding-edge gamers and graphic artists will likely appreciate the increased graphics capability, especially since a handful of DX10 games are due this fall, but like physics cards, I wouldn't consider this a must-have tech until 2008.

However, those who are buying their first computer, or who need to replace a much older OS, will benefit from the change in just about every respect: from stability to out-of-the-box capability. You will lose support for some old programs, especially those written before 2002, but those probably need to be replaced anyways. Vista also requires considerably more memory and hard drive space, so those running an older OS are probably in a position to require a hardware upgrade as well.

Finally, Vista Home Premium is ideal for those who want to get their 21st Century Geek on, especially when coupled with a multimedia, high-framerate, high-def death rig. Rrrr! I'm a truck! (Sorry, I just had to throw in a Wildman Fisher reference).

* The interface has a nice layout right out of the box, but is also easily customized to suite your personal editing habits
* The included plugins are top notch and compare nicely with some of the high dollar add ons for Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects
* Easier to use and learn than Adobe Premiere Pro
* Unlimited Video and Audio Tracks
* Great interactive tutorials are actually useful
* Great chromakey (greenscreen) functionality

Overall, I'm very pleased with the new offering and some of the key upgrades that are now available; with one minor drawback. For positioning sake let me state first that I'm reviewing the product from a business users standpoint however, all of the key upgrades are advantageous to the home and student user as well.

Overall Thoughts

The Microsoft Office team did a great job of reconfiguring the Office 2010 menu/""ribbon"" feature that was introduced with Office 2007. The new ribbon is easier to customize and reduces the need to flip back and forth due to key functions being buried in the ribbon.
Power Point 2010

For a very long time the one thing that has been missing is the ability to embed video into a slide. Well they finally did it! You can embed video into your presentation if you would like. The thing that makes it a five star feature is that Microsoft has added the ability to edit the embedded video inside of the power point slide with no additional software needed. It's not a professional class video editing software package but it will get the job done and it is intuitive to use.

Another great feature of Power Point 2010 is the addition of a broadcast feature. You can now ""broadcast"" a presentation to people even if they do not have a copy of Office installed. All they need is a compatible web browser: Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox. This feature helps out tremendously with cross-platform compatibility issues.

Excel 2010

I use a lot of graphs in my job and the one thing I hated about Office 2007 was how difficult the ribbon system made making a chart with any customization, such as, layering two sets of data with two different vertical axis's. It was so difficult that it just flat stunk and made me long for Excel 2003. Excel 2010 makes that much easier, not perfect, but easier.

The most significant improvement is the addition of ""Spark"" lines. These are small ""micro"" graphs that are contained in a single cell. Each line of data can have its own micrograph and executive summary, very nice feature.

Outlook 2010

The look and feel of Outlook 2010 is more modern and less cluttered than its Office 2007 counter part. The absolute best feature that was added to Outlook 2010 is the preview feature for appointment/meeting requests. The new feature embeds a slice of your calendar into any meeting request and allows you to scroll through your calendar on the requested day and time to see if you wish to accept. No more switch from view to view in order to determine your availability. This has been a huge time saver.

OneNote

Office 2010 now comes standard with OneNote. I have used this product since its initial beta testing and it has become a mainstay for collecting data from meetings and customer research. The must have software group that has been missing for a while.

The one missing piece

I've been using Microsoft's Business Contact Manager for a few years now and I was very disappointed to see that it was not part of the disk version of Office 2010 Pro. In fact, in talking with friends that still work in IT they can't even figure out how to download or get the application off of Microsoft's site. This is after Microsoft made such a big deal out of the new features and how ""customizable"" the application was for the 2010 release. BCM is a great way for companies or entrepreneurs to have CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tools without spending a fortune on one of the enterprise packages such as [...] or Siebel. It's a big miss for the Office team.

For those that have been putting off upgrading because the value position from 2003 to 2007 was light; now is the time. You will get a much better product with 2010 when compared to Office 2003 or Office 2007.",Someone at Microsoft Must Have Been Listening,1284595200,,

I first purchased it when my primary computer began acting sluggish -- it was in need of maintenance but I had no idea what. For me, SM was a god-send ... it breathed new life into an aging machine and allowed me to keep it up and running for 4 more years. I love the product so much that I've used the trial version on my elder parents' machines. I also use it on my DH's machine ... and he's an IT professional.

That said, some words of advice when using SM.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

That said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs. That's what it's done for me.

Word is effectively the standard format for documents in the American business world, and most of my employers use Exchange as their email server. Therefore, what I most want from my office suite is something that 1. works well reading and writing Word documents and 2. provides a way to connect to my employer's Exchange server and properly handle its calendars, meeting requests, etc.

Office 2008 for Mac just does that! I pulled up and edited my old PC Office-created Word resume with no problem, and haven't experienced major issues reading any other Word document yet. The Exchange capabilities of Entourage work like a charm, let you accept and send meeting requests and generally enable you do all of the things you're used to doing with Outlook, but can't currently do with Mac Mail. The simple Excel spreadsheets I used for timesheets pulled up in Mac Excel without a hitch and Messenger and Powerpoint are nice-to-haves.

For better or worse (I say better), the interface for Office 2008 for Mac isn't the ribbon interface you may be used to with Office 2007 for PC, but after getting used to the Mac's Office interface, I actually found it easier to use!

I miss having applications like OneNote (though Word has a similar ""Notebook"" mode), InfoPath and Visio, the forthcoming version of Mac Mail diminishes Entourage's value by providing Exchange support and power-users of Office may miss features like the ability to hack together VBA macros (the Mac Workflows are a bit more limited), but for most business users, Office 2008 for Mac will suit their needs perfectly and provide the necessary hook into the Microsoft Office suite that currently dominates the business landscape.

Overall, I'd recommend the package and think it's an essential purchase for most business users especially since SP2 added Live Workspace and SharePoint integration. However, with Mac Mail gaining Exchange support and because there are several programs for PC Office that don't come with Office 2008 for Mac, the Mac suite loses a star in my eyes.",Great at General Productivity and Exchange Email.

I understood the data mapping functionality of the product but that was never a feature I intended to use. MapPoint 2009 seems to go one better than that earlier version in refining both those features I like and use (ie. direction and route finding) and those which I have less use of.

From a usability standpoint, this interface is intuitive and easy-to-use. For me, there were no problems with moving around the map interface and zooming in to whatever I was interested with either the mouse or keyboard. The various features for route planning is as good as any other on the market today and as this is my primary focus, I'm functionally happy with MapPoint 2009. With the ""optimize trip"", MapPoint 2009 helps me make the best use of my time, especially when I am geocaching when I have to hit caches in several different areas. In that regard, I find it handles off-road situations rather poorly, but that's understandable. With features like being able to create what they call a ""Drivetime Zone"", you can find subtle and cool ways to use your maps. Drivetime Zones will select and show you what you can reach within a set amount of time from a particular center point.

Yes, Photoshop does everything but it is also an enormous systems hog and has a huge learning curve.  It also does nothing simply and many times I LIKE taking the easiest course to get from point A to point B.

I devised a test for how well this new program does against the others.  I took the image of a lily which I had photographed.  I previously had tried to turn it to a pleasing mauve in Elements and failed miserably. I put it into this program and within about twenty minutes I had a gorgeous mauve lily ready to save.  I was frankly surprised I had done that well.

Although it has less tools on the toolbar, I discovered by using other features under the menu that I was able to do pretty much anything I wanted to do. Also, it seems that it may have made one tool to do it all rather than making three or four, like Photoshop or Elements does.  For example, the clone tool on this program seemed to do everything for me that I use clone tool and all aspects of the healing tool for in Photoshop and Elements.  However, I do miss a polygon lasso as this program only has the regular lasso. Both Photoshop and Elements have the polygon lasso. Next, I miss the burn, dodge, and smudge tools, again found in both Adobe programs. On the plus side though, there are filters with controls in this program which go beyond the ones in Photoshop and I am eager to work my way through them. For example, there is a new filter called Bloom that does a wonderful job on enhancing images.

The user interface is absolutely gorgeous, the best ever.  I like the way it looks on my macbook screen better than any other image editing program. Everything automatically disappears while I am working on the image too.  It all reappears the moment I am ready to proceed.  I love that feature! It is so intuitive. Plus the shortcuts you use in the Adobe programs are the same in this program.

I think this program has enormous potential and I especially like that it was designed solely with my OS in mind.  I am so tired of products designed primarily for Windows.

This is the first image editing product I've seen that potentially could go the distance against Adobe at least for the non graphic designer market. Only time will tell.

The basic framework is there: virus protection, routine maintenance, automated backup, updates and security.  But I suspect that it will perform as needed only for those people that install it when the stars correctly align.  For woe unto you who have a problem.  Support may be there, but you'll work yourself into a frazzle just trying to find the support or get an answer.

I'd like to think that I'm somewhere between the average computer user and the uber-geek that writes his/her own source code.  That said, I'm giving up on this product.  Let me tell you why.

First, OneCare offers to set up your wireless security for you.  In my case, it made my wireless access so secure that I couldn't use it.  The double whammy behind that is the fact that the bulk of OneCare's support is ONLINE!  It's tough to get a question about online access answered, when you have to go online to get it and can't.  I searched high and low in the program for something that even remotely resembled a technical support number, no... something that even remotely resembled a telephone number!  But success was not to be had.  Finally, I pushed the reset button on my wireless router, turned off the wireless security firewall in OneCare and was able to go online again.  Help was via a discussion board, and the tech that answered my initial question was out sick when I asked for some clarification.  That delayed response by 4 days!  By the way, Microsoft claims that my particular router is fully compatible with OneCare.

Okay, so the wireless security is no good, at least in my case.  But setting up an automated backup is a great idea right!  Sure, if... if... if you can find a storage device that OneCare is disposed to work with.  My thought (radical free thinker that I am) was that I would perform the initial backup by saving everything to a DVD, then using a lower storage USB stick for the incrementals.  OneCare saw the DVD drive but apparently didn't like it.  The USB stick didn't have enough space, so... can't use that.

But all is not bad.  OneCare did perform a tune-up for me that basically removed files that I removed manually from time to time.  And it's interface to control those programs that automatically load to memory on startup was nice.

But the bottom line is this.  It's a finicky product with no support for the panicky.  If you want to gamble on getting it right, go ahead.  If you prefer a little handholding, stay away.",An incredible disappointment!,1205452800,6,
6339,6339,5.0,True,"12 9, 2011",A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B0068TJ7OC,,Ali Julia,"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software.  When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software.  The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code.  I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right.  This year everything displayed perfectly.

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not  initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns.  I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually.  This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

6. H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.

7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

8. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range.  If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool very helpful.  I purchased this package for $31, last year I saw the prices fluctuate between $25 and the list price of $44.99.

9.  For folks trying to download State Forms before January 16, 2012. The state forms are not available for download until January 16 for most states.
If you go to the Software Update Center on H&R website you will see a section called State Updates. Under there you there is a link called ""Forms Available"". If you click on that, it will show a table that shows availability of forms for each State.  Right now (last checked on 1/6/2011) none of them are available.  I called about my state (Massachusetts) and they told me that most state forms will become available for download on January 16. In the software package, select State Tab and click the button that is called ""Buy""  (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy""  will turn into ""update"" and when the forms will become available they will be downloaded to your computer.

10. ** ERROR ALERT ** 1/16/12 Version of Massachusetts state return contained an error that was corrected in 1/24/12 update.
If you owed taxes on your 2010 State return and paid owed tax in 2011, this payment was incorrectly included in Line 36 on the MA Form 1 as an amount withheld in 2011. This overstates the amount paid to the State for the 2011 tax year. This error has been reported to H&R and corrected in 1/24/12 update. Thank you to Tech Impaired to spotted it and reported to H&R!

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful.  2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past.  So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

We've discovered so much about folks, it's even helped us figure out who the heck is in some of the family photos with only a first name scribbled on the back.

Before I used Family Tree Maker, I'd dabble a bit in our ancestry, but it would all get confusing and overwhelming to the point that it was no longer fun. Now Family Tree Maker keeps track of all the threads, and all I have to do is focus on one person, fill in the information, and Family Tree Maker keeps it all straight.

The only downside is the cost of Ancestry.com annual membership, which is relatively expensive if you get the World option. I understand a need to make this a pay-service, but the cost is prohibitive for those of us who just enjoy dabbling in family history, rather than making it our main hobby.

Altogether it took about 20 minutes, it was a seamless process.  If you know that you want to install on several computers / laptops all at once you're good to go.  If not, you do have an option for later installation:  ""You can always install Sage 50 on additional computers later.""  I was simply installing in on my PC, so opted for the one for now.

One other thing you'll need to consider during installation is disabling your firewall.  I chose to allow my Windows Firewall to work with Sage, but I could also have configured it manually.  There are a few things to consider when installing, but I found it to be an easy step-by-step process with no problems.  I simply closed out everything in the background and concentrated on the installation process.

Sage 50 is perfect for the individual accountant or small business bookkeeper.  Customer support has been spotty in the past and that has been their biggest downfall.  This packet comes with a full year of customer support and online updates.  What I'm seeing and want to see, is easy access for when I need help.  There's online assistance where I can ""manage a case"" by shooting off an email or can access technical support via chat.  Personally I much prefer using phone support when I have issues (866-747-3888).  The proof is in the pudding as they say and if anyone is having issues, later reviews will probably let everyone know how customer support is doing.

Learning curves are sometimes what the individual makes of them.  I'm so far liking what I see.  I was able to take a look at a sample company and could easily spot a section ""Getting Around Sage 50.""  If I can't see anything right in a program or if I have to buy an expansive book I easily become frustrated and will turn away.  Sage has everything right where I want it ... at my fingertips right in the program.  More than likely, the lengthy installation had something to do with this.  I don't want to buy a ""secrets"" sort of book nor do I want to go scouting around on the net to find out something.

I was looking at ""Show-Me-How Videos,"" ""Quick Reference Guides,"" and a list of ""Sage University Courses.""  No further expenditure was needed on my part.  I didn't have to take a pill so to speak from getting a headache looking at a mess.  Everything was laid out nicely and wasn't overwhelming.  Many of the learning areas had drop down menus with additional areas to explore.  I'm going to list what I saw as an easy-access learning menu below.

Do I think I can easily manage and work with this accounting software?  Yes.  Am I confident the company will come through with that customer support that was lacking in the past?  I'm not sure, but that remains to be seen and can't be predicted without more people weighing in.

Years back, when it was owned by different companies, I switched over entirely to Microsoft Word and used WordPerfect only when a project demanded it  a situation that became never. Lately Ive also been growing fond of another word processing program called Scrivener which has many advantages for writers.

 My focus here will be n the word processing component, the eponymous WordPerfect, once the king of word processing.

 Corel has done a good job of rescuing this program,. It has lots of neat features that you will not find in Microsoft Word.

 I was particularly drawn to ePublisher, which facilitates the production of ebooks in MOBI and EPUB formats. This is a template rather than an integrated part of WordPerfect and for basic publishing tasks is easy-to-use and works well.

 WordPerfect also has substantial PDF editing and creation tools, which are very impressive.

 The integral Help file is excellent. The User Interface is streamlined and cleaner in some ways than Words.

 File format compatibility isn't very important to most these days, but WordPerfect can deal with more than 60 file formats in one way or another.

 In all, WordPerfect can be a substitute for Microsoft Word and it has some features, like the much-storied REVEAL codes, thuat cannot be found in Word.

What that means is on the TV there is a menu to select that allows you to use an Amazon or YouTube or Netflix and other apps to access online content on your TV. What this CYBERLINK product does is that same thing but as an external device.

However, we can take our laptop, move it near the TV, attach a $20 HDMI cable to link the two, play the content on the website (i.e. NetFlix, Amazon instant streaming movie rental, YouTube, etc.) and it plays on the TV.

A good thing about this is you can link to a mobile smart phone or an iPad or tablet and show your photos (or do any of the internet media playing). That is cool but it's something our family never wants or needs to do.

So what changed (other than the unconscionable increase in price)?  Well in 2014 TurboTax suddenly discovered that it had been incorrectly calculating depreciation on foreign rental properties.  Instead of using a 40 year life the software used a 27.5 year life, which only applies to properties located within the US.  This occurred year after year despite the fact that TurboTax explicitly asked if the property was located in a foreign country, to which I always checked the ""Yes"" box.

Because of this flaw all of my tax returns going back to 2005 had incorrectly claimed too much depreciation on my Canadian rental property, thereby requiring me to file a complicated Form 3115 to request a change in accounting convention.  Furthermore, I have to report extra income over the next four years so the IRS can recover the excess depreciation I took.  This, in turn, pushed me into a higher tax category and increased the amounts I will have to pay in Medicare premiums.

Judging from the outcry on the Turbotax user forum, many others were also affected by this incorrect depreciation calculation.  I suspect that thousands of taxpayers were impacted.  So why hasn't anyone filed a class action suit against TurboTax?  Well, if you read the software license, by using the software you give up your right to sue Intuit and must settle your grievance in binding arbitration.  Arbitrators almost always find in favor of the company so why even bother going there.  Furthermore, the fine print in the software license states that Turbotax does not guarantee that the software will produce the right answer so you use it at your own risk.  How convenient - for Intuit.

Corel's Video Studio Pro X6 really surprised me. First of all, it's really easy to get started. I had been expecting something complicated, having used Corel's other creative products before. The editor screen here makes it easy to know where the tools are and how to apply the tools, unlike some other home video software. What I really like is the large number of video input formats it supports, since I use a large variety of digital cameras and camcorders.

Why: PowerDVD finally lives up to its title. With TruTheater effects, better controls, remote access, and so much more, you go beyond just being able to watch a movie on you computer. You enjoy your own mini movie theater experience.

For years I've put up with Cyberlink's OEM products on my laptops or desktops, but never really enjoyed them. I found them clunky to use. Nothing about it ever made me want to shell out money to buy the upgrade.

However, when I upgraded my laptop to Windows 8, I discovered it was missing a key feature: The ability to play movie DVDs. Yes, I could use VLC media player. It works just fine for watching DVD movies, but that's all it really is - a good, simple movie DVD player. (If that's all you want, then don't look any further.)

But then I tried Cyberlink PowerDVD 13. I was totally curious. Would the  fully featured version of Cyberlink's PowerDVD be worth it? Does it go beyond their dorky half-hearted programs they put in stock PCs and laptops?

I found my answer very quick. YES. YES IT DOES. A dozen times better than the stock version. Cyberlink PowerDVD finally lives up to its name.

What I discovered:

I like the improved menus. So much easier than the versions I've used in the past. It's more intuitive too.

TruTheater effects and options are wonderful and what really makes PowerDVD stand out. I particularly enjoy TrueTheater's Lighting effects. It amazes me how it clarifies, sharpens, and applies vivid colors. If it's not what you like, you can adjust the settings to your preferences, or shut it off all together. You can activate a split screen help to show before/after effects. Pretty cool.

Ability to watch any movie, video, or photos in 3D. You'll need to buy the red/cyan glasses to enjoy the effect. This is a fun feature to have.

There are apps you can download so you can have remote access to your content. I was able to download the apps for my Kindle Fire HD via 1Mobile app and use it successfully.

PowerDVD also supports BluRay, BluRay 3D, Dolby, UltraHD 4K, AVCHD 3D/Progressive, and many more.
You can use PowerDVD to watch YouTube, Flickr, and Facebook. (Ah, if only it would support Amazon Prime Video or Netflix.)

It can do zoom. While a movie is playing, you can zoom into a scene to get a closer look. (It will pixelate when too close.)

Customize subtitles. Finally a way to change fonts, sizes, etc., so its easier for me to view closed-captions.

My only hesitation about PowerDVD 13 is its bit of a high price. If I hadn't gotten it via Amazon Vine, I would've balked at buying it, especially since my previous experience with older PowerDVD versions. However, now that I've tried it, I think it's worth it because it goes beyond just being able to watch DVDs. You have a mini-movie theater in a box where you can create and enjoy your own movie experiences.

Don't judge PowerDVD 13 by it's anemic predecessors. This one is a winner and is finally living up to it's name. POWERDVD.","Yes, it's a DVD movie player, but so much more too.

12555,12555,5.0,False,"11 3, 2011",A7H1LWFBE905R,B005IHT91Q,,KWJ,"AutoCAD has been the industry standard for 3D drawing software for what seems like centuries, yet it was missing one little thing:  A MAC VERSION.

That little omission has now been rectified with this truly elegant version for Mac.  Having used AutoCAD in the Windows OS, I was really excited to see what it would be like on Mac, and not only was I not disappointed, but it exceeded my expectations.  This isn't just a ""port over"" from Windows OS code. This version was built from the ground up specifically for Mac, yet looks and functions just like its Windows cousin, only with the flair and style that is Mac. Great pains have been taken to make the Mac version's interface (i.e, menus, dropdowns, etc.) extremely similar to Windows, so getting up to speed is quick, and you'll instantly know your way around.

The one thing you won't be used to is SPEED.  The Mac version rocks when it comes to performance over the Windows version.  I have the Windows version installed on a PC with 8GB of RAM and a quad-core processor.  My MacBook Pro has the exact same RAM and processor but, as all Mac users know, code written on the Mac operates much more efficiently than Windows code. Screen changes, image refreshing, file rendering are noticeably, and impressively, faster. Panning or zooming on an object is no longer a reason to go get a cup of coffee while you wait for the screen to refresh.  I've drank a LOT of coffee with the Windows version.  PDF output is excellent, and fast.

The caveats:

**Unless you've used AutoCAD for a while on the PC already, you'll probably need to buy a third-party book if you need instruction on how to use it.  I was stunned to receive the lowly DVD case with one DVD, and no documentation.  Yes, I know, who includes printed docs anymore, but you would expect for the price that there would be some type of getting started doc that would be user-friendly to newbies.  A good book on using AutoCAD will cost you another couple of hundred bucks which, for some, may add insult to injury.

**Another insult is this version is subscription based, and comes with a one-year subscription. I don't know what the annual subscription will be after that, but I suppose somewhere in the middle of the night 12 months from now, my Mac version will quietly expire, and I'll need to reach for the Amex to bring it back to life.

**The Mac version can only be installed on two Macs, and those two Macs cannot run the program simultaneously. This means, you can run AutoCAD on your desktop MAC at the office, and on your MacBook Pro (you really don't want to run this on anything less than that) and you can share files between the two.  But, you can't be using it at home on the laptop while a colleague is using it at the office.

**Expensive.  Yes, it's a high price tag, but there's really no valid equivalent to this software on the market.  It's not a consumer product, and not even a pro-sumer product, so it's priced for the professional who is doing mid-to-high level design for architecture and product prototyping.

All that said, it's an elegant transformation of an industry warhorse, and will surely not disappoint the most demanding user.",It's about time this was available for the Mac!!,1320278400,,

First - the graphical interface, what we users see, is awful.  Someone decided to return to the stone ages in terms of screen contrast. Those with vision issues will likely find this software horrible to use due to the lack of visual contrast.

Second - the pricing scheme is awful.  Check with your employer to see if their mass quantity licensing offers a deal for a 'home use' edition,through the Microsoft Home Use Program (MicrosoftHUP - google it!)  In those cases you can usually find the legal and legitimate sourcing of this software at $9.95 - for up to three systems at home (if the rules haven't changed in the past couple years.) The Home Use Program is often available to employees of the federal government and larger corporations.  (Microsoft - what about the rest of us? We're the ones who NEED special programs for home use!)

Third - if you've already spent good money on this software (or got it cheap through the home use program), why should we have to pay extra for cloud access? Why are we forced to stare at a marketing logo within the valuable ribbon real estate? Again poor choice for us power users.

Fourth - why should I need to buy the software then rent it again in the cloud as Office 365? Microsoft - take notice - Many IT people are refusing to use cloud based programs. Many of us will remain with older, outdated programs than migrate to cloud based apps.

Fifth - There are ample open source Office type programs (such as open office or libreoffice or free office, etc.. there are quite a few legitimate options - again, google it!) as well as 2010 and 2007 still be available and very appropriate desktop solutions. For most home office use it seems wisest to use the free versions such as open office then upgrade to Microsoft when you *need* the extra features included in MS Office suite.

Sixth - what does 2013 really bring to the table that was not available in 2010 (or 2007 for that matter?)  Other than much improved touch screen support, nothing substantial was brought to the screen. Or the desktop. Except the cloud - which many of us do NOT want or cannot use due to our employer policies.

All in all until I truly need the improved touch screen capability I would avoid MS Office 2013 and stick with the tried and true Office 2010 (or 2007 even!), at least until another version or two have been released. If I didn't have access to those programs then I would opt for the freeware / shareware versions instead of spending a small fortune on 2013.  But if you must go with Office 2013 for whatever reason, then the install is pretty straight forward.  Go to office's website /setup, login to the MS account (or create one if you have not before) enter in the product key (found inside this box when purchased).  The install process is quite lengthy, but you can do other things (like update this review) while the humongous software package downloads and completes the install.

I have been using Toast since version 7.  The product originally intended to simplify disc authoring.  It is still great at this.  From a myriad of video formats, Toast will allow you to burn the disc in many ways.  Perhaps, you want the data written to the disc untouched, no problem.  Perhaps, you want the video files you drag into Toast converted to a DVD format to play on any DVD player, no problem. Toast will convert it, and then burn a DVD video disc.  Its capabilities go on and on.

With each addition Toast aims to add  more features.  Social media components continue to be added.  Upload content right to Youtube, Facebook, Vimeo, and Twitter.  One of the last versions also added a great new screen caption feature, to capture video straight from your screen.

Roxio markets Toast 14 as the ""Ultimate Digital Media Toolkit,"" as they aim to provide tools for working with any of your digital media, no longer is Toast simply about disc authoring.

The two newest features are Toast Audio Assistance and MyDVD.  This newest feature allows you to capture, edit, and enhance audio.  Now you no longer have to think of Toast as working with just video, but fixing up all your audio tasks too!  I'm enjoying this feature as I am often importing audio from old sources such as vinyl or VHS recordings of local coffee house concerts from the 90s.

MyDVD is enhanced DVD authoring software.  Now you have even more ways to customize your custom DVD.

Finally, Toast 14 also includes presets for converting video to the best format for some of the latest devices like iPhone 6, iPad, and Samsung Galaxy 6S.

Essentially, when you are going to be working with media on your computer, needing to author a disc, share media content, copy your home video file, edit audio, or do conversion of the content, Toast wants to be what you turn to first.

It's a capable product.  It simplifies many of these tasks, while some are slightly less polished.  The argument others may make is that you can do many of the things that toast offers with free utilities and built in OS X features.  However, Toast brings it all together in Toast 14 Titanium.  You may just find it is easier to get what you need done, without the need to go searching for other software by turning once again to Toast.

(Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)

That said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:

First, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.

I will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).

All of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.

I don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.

Also, none of the forms were usable ""as-is"" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).

Nonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.","Really for individuals & small business ...

Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it.  The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window.
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.

Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site.  I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached.  During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on ""Download Software"" on the top banner, and select ""State Editions"".  Currently it says ""Available in January 2014"".

When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled ""Buy"" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy"" will turn into ""update"" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Update: To post an answer to a good question asked via a comment:  Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
 Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years.  I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.

2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that ""just works"" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.

3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.

4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.

I had been concerned that I might need to go back and reinstall my old copy of Vista in order to install the Upgrade Edition, so I was very relieved everything worked fine on top of the RC.

As part of setup, the Windows 7 Upgrade Edition scans the disk to check that you have a valid version of Windows installed.  On my two systems, it accepted the Windows 7 RC.

Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.
This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.
The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)
I've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.
As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.
I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:
* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever
* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start
* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP
* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically
* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP
* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.
* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.
And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.
In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.
I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.

For years now I've been creative DVDs of pictures and movies for them to watch on their DVD players which has worked out well, but is often a time-consuming process on my end. A few years ago I started using PowerDirector and I was impressed. Year after year PowerDirector has been improved to the point where creating DVDs is a quick and almost enjoyable process.

I've used more expensive programs in the past, particularly Adobe Premiere... PowerDirector isn't quite as accurate and is missing a few features, however it's faster and easier to put together videos. I'm not looking to edit a blockbuster movie and what PowerDirector offers is perfect. My DVDs are usually just a picture slideshow with brief sections of videos in between.

2307,2307,3.0,False,"10 10, 2008",AMUP8DYE7EAN2,B0013A5GGE,,mateo52,"In theory, 360 2.0 is a comprehensive all-in-one security package that frees the user from the need to remain cognizant of maintenance needs, especially if one has multiple PCs to be serviced, and for newer units with mid to upper range capability that is the case.

After months of ambivalence (and waiting for the supposed automatic offer), I decided to upgrade from version 1.0 to 2.0 on three computers: One desktop with 4 GB of memory with Vista Ultimate, a laptop with Vista home premium and 2GB memory, and an 8 yearold but highly reliable CPU with only 256MB memory. Version 1.0 ran adequately on the first two units and from all appearances this version 2.0 is not as resource intensive as the earlier version however, LiveUpdate remains an annoyance.

Similarly to version 1.0, it appears the only other Norton product that is compatible with 360 is Norton Ghost.

In the case of the older unit, performance of Norton 360  was consistently problematic so I was not surprised to encounter difficulties with the upgrade however I had no inkling of the extent of encumbrances I would face in what from a cursory view appeared to be a rather benign installation.

Like security suites offered by other vendors version 2.0 includes virus protection (unfortunately still updated via LiveUpdate whereas NIS 2009 is migrating to real time updating) firewall, spyware and intrusion protection, email scanning, parental controls and anti-spam filtering. The latter mentioned features are available as add-on packs accessible from Symantec's website. This version also enhances network monitoring capabilities and expands supported media for backups. Curiously, and incongruently, while network attached storage devices like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Netgear-RND2150-ReadyNAS-Duo-500-GB-Desktop-Network-Attached-Storage/dp/B0013G04AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Netgear RND2150 ReadyNAS Duo 500 GB Desktop Network Attached Storage</a>&nbsp;are discovered by network monitoring, automatic backup to the same device is not supported. It should also be noted the only qualitative difference I can see between the standard version and the premier version of 2.0 is the increased online secure backup storage of  10GB in the case of the premier edition. Standard edition availability is 2GB and in my opinion neither is sufficient. As an all in one product, some compromises in user control could be anticipated however it would have been an advantage if the user was offered the capability to backup individual files rather than continuing the limitation to classes of folders. Essentially, while backup to ipods is intriguing, I see little advantage to employing this backup facility over the functionality existent in both XP and Vista operating systems.

The network monitoring feature is beneficial but is flawed to the extent multiple devices connected to a single access point  like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NETGEAR-HD-Gaming-5-GHz-Wireless-N-Networking-Kit-WNHDEB111/dp/B00126R3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111)</a>&nbsp;are not individually distinguishable. Only the mac address of the access point is identified therefore from my primary computer I cannot fully monitor a second PC or my NAS.

This version also includes registry cleaning as a component of the PC tune-up facility and ""identity safe security"" of personal information like social security, bank account and credit card numbers. The phishing filter is an improvement over version 1.0 however it still lacks the comprehensiveness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Site-Advisor-Plus-2009-1-User/dp/B001EJQTUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Site Advisor Plus 2009 1-User</a>&nbsp;in as much as it does not offer advice search engine results. Significantly, the phishing filter does not work with Safari or Google chrome.

And then there was the upgrade on my older PC...

In spite of Norton's representations, I would not recommend installation on any PC that meets only minimum system requirements. At every step, I encountered difficulties that severely constrained the process and after 24 man hours devoted to installation the process is still incomplete.

First and foremost, upgrade is not automatic. Although 360 offers three PC licensing, I could not download the upgrade via my existing account. Only after email inquiry was I provided  an address that facilitated download to my second and third PCs. In the instance of my oldest unit I made the mistake of running the recommended system scan before installation. It occurred to me as well, this does not generate a great deal of confidence in Norton if in fact one is upgrading or replacing an existing Norton anti-virus program. I received a message indicating this version was incompatible with Windows Defender so I had to remove that program before proceeding. I did not pre-scan with the other two PCs and no compatibility issues were identified nor I have experienced any since the upgrade or have I ever encountered issues in the two years I used 360 version 1.0.

Although during install procedure on my first computer I was advised existing add-on packs should be backed up using another program that must be downloaded from the Norton site, the same message was not received for either of the later installs and the add-on pack itself appeared on my desktop upon completion of the preliminary stages, but I get ahead of myself. The install aborted three times because LiveUpdate was running in the background and could not be terminated even manually via msconfig or the task manager. When I finally managed to disable it, I later discovered another version initiated by Norton Ghost could not be removed, so I had to uninstall Ghost before proceeding. Degradation of system performance was clearly evident as at least five hard stops were required and in each case the difference in boot times was visually perceptible without Norton running. Eventually, the install was completed but start up would not progress past the call to explorer.exe which was visible but the desktop icons were never painted...another hard stop via task manager and restart.

Finally, the configuration wizard appeared and I was able to setup the program...only to discover Norton had identified un-removable cookies,an un-repairable virus and my virus definitions from version 1.0 had not updated via LiveUpdate for more than 8 months. Following program instructions to contact online support for more information, I reached site catch 22 as the more information could not be gleaned until I defined the problem inhibiting installation...After removing the cookies with spybot and determining the virus was most likely Norton Ghost LiveUpdate, and  running a new version of LiveUpdate for more than two hours to acquire all of the missed updates, I received an email from support advising I should download a software removal tool to wipe out any residue programs, which of course would also wipe out my latest install and render 14 hours of effort pointless.

So now, I have version 2.0 installed and running with significantly greater degradation than version 1.0 as it applies to response time for Explorer or Firefox so I'm using Safari as the default browser and it performs with blazing speed even on this under resourced box with Norton installed. Of course...my install of Microsoft Office suite has been damaged so I have time to type this on another computer while I wait for the re-install to finish...",The Dickensian install,1223596800,,

+ Standard version includes the 4 programs you actually want!
+ Like most new MS suites, allows for easier transfer between machines
+ Allows you to use on your home desktop AND your laptop!!  Huge plus!!
+ New open document format based on xml - good for techies
+ Alternatively, you can still use the doc format you know and love
+ Excel now supports larger documents with more fields!
+ Cool new Powerpoint extras
+ Once you do overcome the learning curve, design has some plusse
+ Preloaded with Vista OEM computers, so install is MUCH faster than old version

Cons

- A list price of $400 means many will forgo Outlook and buy Home & Student suite for MUCH LESS
- The ribbon puts things in WEIRD places
- Microsoft disabled classic menus so you can't find stuff ... ARGH!!!
- Startup times seem a little slower ... why????
- Strangely slow performance with Word

The general hatred for the ribbon is well known.  Microsoft Word and Excel have drawn the most heat.  It took everybody years to learn those nested menus and hard to find functions.  Now they are all moved!!!!

Actually, the ribbon wouldn't be so bad if you could have your regular old classic menus above it.  Once you learn the ribbon, there's some logic to the way things have been relocated.  Still, this was a huge blunder and I wonder if MS will back track on that.

Is Outlook worth $250 now? To be fair, there are cheaper upgrade versions.  Still, I may be switching to a new email / calendar / productivity program all-together.

The new XML doc format is Microsoft's way of getting away from the proprietary .doc format.  This will aggravate some people too, but you can just save everything in the 2003 format.  I like the new format and I think it will catch on with time.

There are3 40 core lessons that are named after situations that learners of the Spanish language are likely to encounter.  For example:

* Checking In
* in the hotel room
* making a long distance call
* at a restaurant
* asking for directions
* finding an address
* Introductions
* at a party
* making an appointment
* at the pharmacy
* at the doctor's office
* at the laundry
* at the gas station

All 40 of the lessons include the following sections: Vocabulary sections, Vocabulary exercises, Dialogs, Dialogs Exercises, Grammar, Grammar Exercises, and Interactive Conversation.

The software also features ""workshops"" where the student will have the chance to practice in five areas:
Grammar, Pronunciation, Vocabulary, Conversation, and Simulations

The software also has lots of games to help break the monotony of studying Spanish. I have not had a chance to play the games but they seem to consist of crossword puzzles and online games.

This software also includes a ""progress"" section so that you can measure how well you are learning how to speak Spanish.  But one of my favorite sections of the software was the ""tools"" section which allowed me to customize my lessons.  It even allowed me to set my ""minimum achievement level"" which I left at the default (70%). In this section, I was also able to select the lessons based on which was the most important to me to learn. Such as:

1. The Complete Program
2. Everyday Life
3. Business Spanish
4. Travel
5. Going Out
6. Shopping
7. Complete Customization

They often try to do too much -- probably to convince you that they're more valuable than the freebies -- and wind up eating all your CPU cycles and bringing your computer to its knees. In fact, that was my initial experience with McAfee 2016 Total Protection on my Windows 10 x64 laptop. McAfee was consistently eating 18%-25% of my CPU, and I'm this wasn't during a periodic in-depth scan and it even persisted when I turned off ""real time protection.""

I contacted tech support for help. McAfee technical support is available 24 hours/day, which is nice, but it also enormously confusing, which is not. McAfee's web sites are poorly organized, often leading you around in circles as you try to figure out which link is the right one to follow. Part of the problem is that McAfee has recently been acquired by Intel, and they're still trying to get all their stuff integrated. Another problem is that almost none of the materials on their web site refers to Total Protection, which is either so new they haven't gotten around to documenting it yet, or it's already been discontinued, so they're never going to get around to documenting it. Skipping over the painful process of actually requesting service, I got a  pleasant woman from the Philippines on the line (good English; no complaints) who poked around my computer using LogMeIn and concluded that there was nothing wrong. She informed me that if McAfee is taking up 15% to 20% of CPU ALL THE TIME !!!! that's normal.

If that was normal, I would have removed it already. Fortunately, something she did, something I did, something in the most recent update, and/or something that Microsoft did with its most recent Windows 10 update (the most likely answer, I think) substantially resolved the problem, so, at this particular moment McAfee is using between 0.5% and 1.0% of CPU. Note that Real Time Protection may use a lot of CPU while you're doing backups, because it's checking each file as it's opened. This means that just at the time your computer is most loaded down, it will be even more loaded down ... which is OK as long as it happens while you're sleeping.

As for the Android portion of Total Protection. I (a) can't figure out what it is or what it does, and (b) can't figure out how to get it for my Amazon Fire Phone, which does not (without some minor hacking) have access to the Google Play store, the default repository for all Android apps. (Not McAfee's fault, of course.) There is no documentation available (as far as I can tell) about Total Protection for Android or iOS on the McAfee web site, which doesn't help. I tried getting support tonight, but their wait times at 10pm MST were so long that the chat program timed out on me three times and I wasn't able to  get someone on the phone before I had to take another call. So ... ?

Bottom line: If the current $29 price holds up, this is reasonable quality commercial computer protection for all the computers in your household. (I say ""reasonable quality"" because it's protection is rated as at least good by the independent evaluators, but it doesn't typically get top scores.) Support leaves something to be desired, but at least it's 24 hour support, and you should be able to get someone on the phone if you can wait a while. It's hard to tell if this product is just ramping up or is on its way out.","Some problems with CPU load, some problems with support, but nice to have all your computers covered at a reasonable price",1449100800,,

When I got it, I was thinking it would be just like the Windows edition, just with the traffic light buttons at the top.  I love how everything is floating (not constrained in a Windows; you have toolbar at top, tasks in the middle, and any other items float on the desktop), this is great for when you need to open other files and still view QuickBooks, since you can put the windows side by side and still see both documents (for example copying a contact from the address book to Customer List is simple since the two small windows can sit right by each other and you can just copy and paste each item).  The next great thing is the installation, like many Mac apps it was simply a drag and drop to the application folder and it was installed.  I then was able to activate with the License and Product number and register online, super simple (took about 2 minutes).  The software was easy to set up (I have used QuickBooks for Windows in the past and am familiar with the software), my only flaw is that the first time I used it closed (red exit) on the Company Home Page and the toolbar trying to close QB, but then found I had to Quit from the Dock (or Menu), when I reopened QB, nothing was their and I had to go to Company >> Company Home, and Show Company Toolbar to get it -- Just FYI, I learned that I need to Quit from the Dock or the Menu.  The program opens very quick on my computer (I am using Mac OS X Lion [10.7.2]) and I love the number indicator lights on my items to show me what I have out their at a glance (for example a red number on Invoice to show how many open invoices I have [like on the Mail App for New Mail]).  I was able to set up my accounts with just the Default settings for my industry and was able to create my item list and Customer list very easily, the Help >> Search section is great since if you are looking for a list or setting you can type it in and it will find it for you (and show you where in the menu it is, and you can open it from their).  In the box their was a paper to show you how to import Windows based QuickBooks files, however, since I used to use Simple Start (Free for Windows), I created a new company, since I wanted the full settings from the start.

Another point I want to show, is how much of an improvement the look and feel of the software is.  I love how I can view my invoices or payments or estimates just by using the info on the left and then I can scroll through them flawlessly and view live information on the invoice or go into Preview Mode and scroll through each invoice without having to open Print Preview, as well as see quick info on the customer (like Customer Info and recent transactions!).  This software has such a genuine feel to it, which just makes it perfect!  I can see everything of my business in a quick glance without having to go through lists of information and then opening and closing widows till I find the one, this is an amazing edition of QuickBooks and is just perfect for me as a freelancer!

I also want to add how great support for QuickBooks programs are!  I use QuickBooks POS at work and had the best experience setting it up with the help of our representative and the online community.  Just as I am seeing on this product with the number of Manufacture Replies, I am seeing great customer service who is trying to help customers at every point of the experience.  I have used phone support and online support for my Intuit products in the past and have never had a bad experience.  I am glad to see the Manufacture comments on other reviewers, as that shows me that Intuit is ensuring that their products are working properly and are listening to customer feedback!  And just like our POS system I know if I need help their is entire community of Intuit product users who can help me just by me posting a question or finding others with the same inquiry.

In the end this is great software for keeping up with your business, it allows me to keep track of my freelancing and easily manage my money flow, and all from my Mac!

But sometimes, no matter how good the graphics are, they usually can't hide an empty storyline and a game in need of many touch ups. This game is an example of a decent edition to the series, and even though it's not one of my favorites, it doesn't need ""makeup"" to make it shine.

Story: 8.5/10. This game has a decent story that holds together pretty well. Much of the game centers around centuries old history, much of it on Marie Antoinette. Although you ended up learning a few things, the story was still very inticing and it wasn't like they were shoving all of the information down your throat.

Graphics/Setting: 8/10. I'm not going to rate a lot of this game on graphics, mainly because the graphics of today are automatically compared to these graphics, and considering this game and the new games were released a decade apart, I think it's fair to somewhat disregard the graphics. I liked the setting, even though you stay in one place, and I like moving around more. But this castle was ginormous, and I had plenty of trouble just finding my room.

Characters: 8/10. The characters this time all have pretty stand-out personalities. You have Dexter Egan, the caretaker of the building, Professor Hotchkiss, a hilarious if not somewhat annoying author who can never get Nancy's name right, Lisa, a photojournalist, and Jacques Brunais, a french ski intructor. They all have a distinct personality, and are a great touch to the overall atmosphere.

Puzzles: 7.5/10. They're weren't that many puzzles, but the ones that were there were hard, but they fit the game.

Exploration: 9/10. Exploring is a big part of this game, and I got lost a lot. The castle is so big, and there's plenty for you to explore and have an adventure in.

Activities: 4/10. Activities weren't really evident in the older games, and they're weren't any here either.

Ending: 6.5/10. The ending was somewhat not surprising, and a pretty simple one too, yet it still gave me the goosebumps that good Nancy Drew PC endings give me. You people know what I mean.

Total (averaged): 7.3 out of 10, rounded to....

1. Don't get this if you are a beginner or are getting something for a hobby. There are free and low cost programs out there that are better suited for your needs.

2. The font manager is a nice thing to have if you have a lot of fonts. I do, but I was skeptical about how much I would use it. It shows the fonts at a larger size and makes it easier to select than in programs with such tiny font previews.

3. PowerTrace makes great vector images from art you couldn't otherwise enlarge without a lot of quality loss.

4. The Photo Zoom seems to enlarge pictures very well. I was able to enlarge and print family photos from a pretty small size. The larger and higher quality the image, of course, the better this works.

5. I don't like having to connect to the internet to activate and use software. I know it's just where the industry is going, but I don't have to like it. Meanwhile the warez crowd will get whatever they want completely unfettered.

6. I didn't even bother to try the Help section. Run a search for whatever you're trying to do on it, and someone will probably have a tutorial or instructions that won't confuse you like ""Help.""

The OCR works better than older versions of PaperPort and other packages that I have used. It's still not perfect, but we'll probably have to wait through a couple of more generations of hardware and software evolution for perfection. It's VERY good though now. As a test I scanned in a chapter of a book that I was reading. It was a hard cover, and PaperPort was probably 98% accurate.

After scanning some documents are organizing them through PaperPort, I confirmed that both Windows Search and Google Desktop had properly indexed the contents of the files. That is VERY useful.

A couple of things to think about when evaluating electronic filing systems.

1 - You will need a scanner in addition to this software. I know - it seems unnecessary to point this out, but some people do not seem to realize that.
2 - If you are going to scan in a bunch of documents, bills, statements, etc, you will want to invest in a good back-up system.

Since Windows Movie Maker is no longer included with Windows 10, I'm looking for replacement software.

Corel has been around forever in graphics software (I remember using Corel Draw in the early 1990s when I did some part time work as a graphic arts designer), although video is a newer area for them.

To get around these problems, I switch all the auto-format features off, and ship anything that needs to be accurately conveyed as a .PDF (Adobe Acrobat), which Word is highly integrated with.

Advancing forward frame-by-frame is smooth, but advancing in reverse isn't smooth. I can't comment on the Blu-ray or 3D abilities yet since I have not tested them.

The player allows you to capture frames of any scene by using the soft-remote. Specify the location in the preferences.  You can also use your smartphone as a remote by installing the PowerDVD remote software on the smartphone and entering the passcode provided in the main window under Devices. You need to download the app for Android or iPhone from the website first. There are some free versions, and other versions for $20.  PowerDVD also lets you view your videos and photos contained on your smart-device.

Options allow you to use hardware acceleration if needed, especially if you want to watch 3D or Blu-ray movies.  Another option available is the ability to use True Theater Effects for cinematic lighting, but I don't use it since my monitor gets the lighting right without it. Additional options let you choose speaker configurations and HD audio output for that full audio experience.  And lastly, you can add your own voice-over and karaoke too.

The first time you run the software, it will ask for the CD Key to activate on your PC. I did not have any issues with activation. I have not had to deal with customer service either.
I recommend updating any video drivers for your video card if necessary. This software has been running without issue for me. But it all depends on your computer specs and video card, and some people's experiences may be different.  The PowerDVD main window has multiple tabs for Movie, Video, Photo, Music Devices, so you can watch other video clips you have on your hard drive, view your photo galleries, or listen to your music library. The software automatically obtains detailed information about movies, and ratings from online if you are connected, but it seemed pointless and useless to me.

Included in the box is the installation DVD and a 100 page, fully-detailed instruction manual.  The installation took less than 5 minutes.  For DVD movies and DVD-R discs, this software works

In particular, EXCEL is far inferior as Microsoft eliminated any support for macros or Visual Basic in the Mac version.  For a home user with simple needs this is not a serious drawback.  For anyone who exchanges files in a business environment forget about this product.  It is not fully compatible and crashes often.  It will drive you crazy and let you down when you are in the middle of a project with a tight deadline.

WORD also crashes a lot and causes the loss of your work.  A message will come up saying ""WORD has to close unexpectedly,"" and that's it.  All your work is gone.  Back in 1980 we accepted this from computers and saved our work religiously.  This is 2009 and this kind of incompetence is unacceptable.

It is nothing short of dishonesty to claim that Office for the Mac provides the same functionality as Office for the PC.  The latter is light-years ahead in terms of sophistication and stability. Don't believe any salesman who claims the two versions are equivalent.  The Mac version is primitive by comparison.

If you are thinking about using a Mac for business think again.  The only way to do that is to get the PC version of Office and run it under Boot Camp or Parallels.

I don't really understand how the interface is supposed to work. Apparently you can only switch between workspaces if you've saved your document first, or whatever you've got loaded goes away? Or is it the workspace itself you're supposed to save? Needless to say, this is a bit of a problem for this review.

That said, this is still a pretty good program once you figure out exactly what's going on. The interface is similar to Photoshop Elements, with Manage, Adjust, and Edit workspaces that you can (somehow) switch between. As it happens, I generally prefer to use GIMP, and PaintShop compares pretty favorably to that too. There's plenty of tools; anything you need to do can probably be done here; in Adjust mode, you get a pile of filters and tweaks (iPhoto-style), while in Edit mode you get a full photo-paint interface, with a huge selection of filters and Photoshop-style layers. Basically, it's pretty much everything you might be looking for. As for the ancillary programs, I haven't really looked at them.

This is a pretty versatile program, and quite a bargain to boot. However, getting up and running in it is likely to take a while, stumbling through menus and preference panes to figure out exactly what's going on before you get your workflow going. This isn't a huge liability, but it's definitely a pain if you're, say, a reviewer with a limited period of time to learn your way through.

We own a small LLC, so each year we have to buy TT Business at nearly $100 and TT Deluxe @$60, which seems prohibitively expensive. We consider this parceling of the software for a two person LLC to be a rip-off.

But, this year we discovered another rip-off, when we learned that TT Deluxe is ""crippleware"" when it comes to calculating capital gains from buying and selling stocks. Like a lot of folks, we have an Ameritrade brokerage account, so we can buy and sell a few stocks, which we did this year. Ameritrade likes their customers and provides a great piece of software called GainsKeeper, to calculate the cost basis of each stock transaction.

Now, here's the rub: TT Deluxe is SUPPOSED TO import this data from your Ameritrade or other account. However, this feature does not work properly, ESPECIALLY if you bought a stock, say APPLE, in more than one lot. The import feature only pulls in the basics of the listing for each stock transaction, so you get to RE-ENTER all the data, from Ameritrade, FROM SCRATCH. WHAT A JOY!!!

Meanwhile, the software displays a sales pitch dialog encouraging you to spend another $30 to immediately upgrade to TT PREMIERE!!

What a ripoff! I can't believe how INTUIT is doing this to their customers! I would not have bought TT DELUXE if I knew (which I could not have known) that it would not import my stock purchases correctly. Worse, if you back up and EXPORT the data from Ameritrade in a TTF file, the software will IMPORT the file, but will not RECOGNIZE any of the stock transaction data, which indicates that INTUIT has CRIPPLED TT Deluxe intentionally.

As a former software validation analyst, I have to warn all TT DELUXE consumers that CRIPPLING a piece of software to reap more profits is a HORRIBLE BUSINESS MODEL and a real ripoff to consumers.

We ended up having to edit each and every single stock transaction, one-at-a-time, in order to complete our return. So, I went from being VERY SATISFIED with the software (as we did not find a lot of bugs this year so far, as has been the case in the past) to COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED.

Way to go INTUIT SALES & MARKETING! Next Year, we won't need TT Business or TT Deluxe, as we will have a simpler return and we will be buying H& R Block software instead. We don't tolerate being ripped off by CRIPPLEWARE!

You do need a DVD drive to use it (three of our home computers don't have a DVD drive). You also need a mouse, that's all you need.

This is a fun program in which you manipulate the mouse to make art. Since I own and use Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 I note some of the controls are quite similar such as selecting the tool and opacity and working with layers.

To start, you just click on the type of medium you want to use (i.e. marker, pencil, paintbrush) then select the thickness, color, and opacity and you are off and running. The menu bar is in the corner and you can expand some of them if you find that easier.

I started fooling around with this without directions, since none came in a paper form and I'm a book person. However there are tutorial documents on the disc to help you. On a whim I used an internet search engine and found video tutorials from the manufacturer on YouTube. These helped me the most.

I am an amateur artist and enjoy this program. I let my kids test it out, they are aged 10 and 13 and both found it simple. They used the tools intuitively and found more features than I realized existed. They really liked the split screen mirror image tool and the one that repeats in the four quadrants what you do on the screen (imagine drawing with one line but seeing an image like a kaleidoscope).

Since I am new to making digital art, I realize there's a learning curve. While I can control a regular drawing pencil in my hand to sketch on paper, it's a completely different skill to use the mouse to replicate the same thing. It's an odd feeling to try to do something you know you can do with pencil and paper but struggle to make a smooth or straight line with the mouse as the tool. In the beginning it feels like a trick on the mind to use a mouse and see the medium you usually associate with a regular marker, paintbrush, or pencil making magic on the screen.

I have no compaints about this product.

As with any computer program or with any traditional art medium, what you get out of it depends both on what you want to do with it (translating your concept to reality) and also how much time you put into learning the skills, procedures and techniques necessary to get it to do what you want it to do.

I decided Fusion, because I liked the idea of being able to use both Mac OS and Win OS at the same time.  Parallels allowed for dual-boot, but not at the same time (from what I understood from the marketing).  Flash-forward to today: Fusion has had ups and downs, and although I'll stick with it, if you want performance, you want Parallels.

UNBOXING:
First of few Amazon shipments that came in a box sized to the item inside.  Inside the Fusion box, it came with install DVD, USB stick and instructions.

REVIEW:
So, the gist of this is that it's Fusion 4 with some slight add-ons.  Although the box claims 1.4x faster than Fusion 4, I don't really recognize any speed advances on my old MacBook.  Fusion 5 allows for syncs with Retina Display, USB 3.0 and more memory utilization.  However, my MacBook is from 2007 and doesn't have any of that.

So then I went over to see what Parallels offered, and man, I was blown away by some of the upgrades it's had over the years.  Now, when benchmarked versus Parallels 8, we see that in 8 out of 9 evaluations, Parallels out benchmarks Fusion by lots.  Check out the review at macobserver dot com.

OVERALL:
Whereas my dated MacBook wouldn't really notice the difference between Fusion 4 and 5, I think it would probably do better on Parallels 8.  However, I'm keeping with the Fusion warhorse until it doesn't support my old system any more.

I am so frustrated with this software. All I wanted to do was pull in three or four stills along with three short videos. Total run time about 2 minutes. Adding captions was limited as far as I can tell; I was not able to do what I wanted to do. Then when I tried to export a .mp4 file Pinnacle Studio 18 failed to export the video portions. I've now spent about three hours on this little project and have not been able to spit out my little project.

There's no way I'd buy this software and don't recommend it.

I take it all back. Dropping back to 3 stars.  While Pinnacle Studio 18 has basic video editing capabilities the user interface sure needs some improvement. On top of that the Help PDF file could be better as well. I had to refer to customer youtube videos to get a few basic things done recently.

The user interface for importing video files is cumbersome. Managing those video files within the tool is much too complex for a basic tool like this.

At one point I wanted to separate a sound track from a video file. At first I couldn't figure out how to do that so I went to the help file but found nothing. Then I went to the user forum where there was even confusion whether Studio 18 could even do that basic task. In the end I found it to be quite easy to do, albeit a little hidden. This is an example about how the user interface and help file could be greatly improved.

I was easily able to add a title to a video. When it came to adding a caption to overlay part of a video I searched and searched. Finally a user youtube video helped. The solution was to click on a video segment and use the Title key again. How is a user supposed to figure that out? Title is title and Caption is caption. How easy it would have been to simply add a Caption button and make the editing behavior be easier to use.

So, as I have no better tool, I'll continue to use Studio 18, but there's no way I'd buy an upgrade version of this product.

Well I'm bumping my review up from 3 stars to 4. My son and I both purchased GoPro cameras and I've just finished editing two hours of captured motorcycle dirt ride video down to 13 minutes. I included fade-in and fade-out sound, titles, and captions that overlay the video. I'm beginning to understand the capabilities of the tool.

I do find the user manual a bit lacking, but goggling user help turns up text or youtube help that solves the issue.

There are definite speed improvements using Studio 18 over Microsoft Movie Maker.

I am dropping from 4 stars to 3 stars based on the fact that I can not get Pinnacle Studio 18 to export a decent video with the particular input file I'm using. This is the main thing a video editor needs to do so if it fails that it is pretty much useless. I give it two stars based on the features it has, and the fact that my problem seems to be just that - my problem.

I could find little evidence that Exported video quality is a widespread issue with Studio 18. There were very few complaints about video quality. My problem has to do with the input file I was working with. It is a file downloaded from the internet. Nonetheless that is the file I wanted to edit and it didn't come out well. At the same time Microsoft Movie Maker did a fine job on it.

It works well with better input files. I tried one from my DSLR camera and the final file from Pinnacle Studio 18 and Microsoft Movie Maker came out nearly as good as the input file.

I did try to contact Pinnacle but they want to be paid for support which I consider poor customer support. I did interact with the user forum where I picked up some hints on how to improve output quality but nothing worked.

I can use the program but it looks like it is going to be hit or miss depending on the quality of the input file. To save myself the trouble I'll just continue using Movie Maker most of the time unless I feel I want to use a more advanced editor at which time I'll try Studio 18.

At this point I wouldn't spend money on this product and wouldn't recommend it.

Trouble. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but the video quality rendered in MP4/1080 is poor. I've tried to search the internet for help but didn't find any. If I create a video for Facebook no problem. But I have some videos that I wanted to trim some bad parts then render for watching on our large flat screen display. But even on my 24"" 1920 x 1080 computer monitor the output of Pinnacle Studio 18 is a disappointment.

I took a single file, cut out all but the first 5 minutes, then Exported an MP4/1080 video from Pinnacle Studio 18. The results were much less than satisfactory.

I then took the same file, again cut out all but the first 5 minutes, then Saved the move for High Definition Display using Microsoft Movie Maker. The results were quite good.

I will attempt to contact Pinnacle to see if there is anything I can do. I have a hard time believing the rendered output file can't be improved. A video editor tool that outputs bad quality video files is useless. But I've tried a number of attempts to obtain better image quality without success. Even if Pinnacle provides a solution it shouldn't be this hard.

Dec 10, 2014 Update
Today I captured a video of my 4-year-old receiving his yellow belt in Kempo Karate. Using Pinnacle Studio 18 I cliped out a part that was too long, then added a transition to make that cut out section flow nicely in the video. Then I added a title and a closing graphic transition.

Pros:
- Easy to install
- Easy to use the basic video editing features (without reading the manual if you can poke around a bit)
- The user manual is pretty good.
- The on-line video tutorials are quite informative.
- Pinnacle Studio 18 comes with a large number (1,500) of transitions.
- Comes with over 500 sounds (animals, bells, cartoons, etc.)
- Comes with 45 music clips
- Comes with over 550 Title video segments
- You can import photos and do some basic editing of them.
- It is easy to see that this program offers many features including multiple video tracks and audio tracks.

Cons:
- I had a difficult time altering the default execution time for a transition. Perhaps I need to read up on this.
- I was hoping I could ""crop"" or ""zoom"" a video. That doesn't seem to be available. On the other hand I don't know if any video editors allow that feature. Perhaps it is too much to expect.

Dec 9, 2014 Update
While watching some vacation video I found one that I had captured hand held with a long zoom lens and the video was shaky. I wondered if Pinnacle Studio 18 could stabilize it and sure enough that feature exists. I loaded the video file, ran the Stabilize Render and Play process and Poof the video was now much more watchable. Nice feature. Once again it consumed about 80% of my 64-bit quad-core 2.4GHz processor.

Dec 7, 2014 First Impressions. I've only had Pinnacle Studio 18 for a couple of days and just started using it today. I am a relative novice with video tools but I have quite a lot of computer experience.

I received Pinnacle Studio 18 free as a member of the Amazon Vine program.

I have used powerful video editing tools in the past, but my recent reference is Windows Movie Maker in Windows 7. For my needs Windows Movie Maker has been sufficient, although there were things I wished I could do to my videos which Windows Movie Maker did not support, such as zooming.

After I loaded Pinnacle Studio 18 it immediately offered to load a patch update which I accepted. The update worked flawlessly.

I have a great deal of computer experience, including being a graphical user interface programmer for 10 years. I believe I should be able to start a new software tool and use the basic features without first reading a user manual, or else the program does not have a good user interface. On the other hand every piece of software is unique so there is a start-up learning curve. Accessing the more advanced features usually requires reading the manual or watching tutorials.

I jumped right into a project involving four video files spanning about 15 minutes. I wanted to view the video content, and clip out any sections I didn't want to be part of the final video. Within 15 minutes I was able to discern the basics; loading my video files into the tool, putting the four videos in the order I wanted, assigning the videos to the timeline, and I learned how to cut out unwanted clips. It took me about an hour to work over my video, and begin the process of saving the final MPEG-4 500 megabyte file. So the tool passed my basic requirements.

After going through this early basic learning curve I find Pinnacle Studio 18 is easier to use than Windows Movie Maker. I am very likely to use Pinnacle Studio 18 for my video projects going forward.

Pinnacle offers on-line video tutorials as well as a text based user manual. I watched a bit of one of the youtube.com videos which I thought was quite good. I will likely take advantage of those tutorials for some of the advanced features.

This tool works my computer quite hard. I have a quad 2.4GHz processor with 8GB of RAM so it is reasonably powerful. I also tend to have several things running on my computer. I did encounter slow operation of all of my computer tasks while Pinnacle Studio 18 was rendering and saving my video file. As soon as the file was saved, which was much faster than Windows Movie Maker would have taken, my computer was freed up and working normally.

The resulting video file was smooth and the transitions were clean.

I'm not done and intend to re-edit my video, adding fancy transitions. I may try some voice-overs too. I will return here to add more comments. I realize this review is currently lacking in useful detail.",User interface is challenging at best,1417910400,2,

It's not that I've had significant problems with PDVD14 -- not at all. It installed easily and it runs just fine. True, I haven't been able to access my 10GB of ""free"" (no additional charge for one year) ""Cyberlink Cloud"" online storage for reasons that appear to have something to do with the way I set up my account, but pretty much everything else seems to work.

My mistake was not in choosing a product that wasn't up to my needs, but rather in choosing a product that performs some functions I don't need, some functions I don't even understand, and some functions that were already performed perfectly well by other products that I wasn't looking to replace. For example, I don't need any of the nifty 3D-related features because I don't have any 3D TVs or monitors. I had never even heard of 4K UltraHD before I read the description of this product. Nor had I heard of DLNA (the Digital Living Network Alliance) or their plans for making it easier to share video (and other stuff???) across cell phones, tablets, computers, TVs, toasters, and blenders. I frankly don't understand yet whether this functionality does me any good, not least because PDVD14 doesn't make it clear when this would benefit you or talk about what sorts of planning you need to do in order to make it work.

However, ""This program does more stuff than I need it to"" is not a serious complaint. The reason I gave the program 3 stars instead of 4 or 5, however, is that by packing all of these diverse functions into a single program with a single hierarchical left-hand-side menu, they've created an overbearing, unfocused, and confusing piece of software. It's big and it's ugly (admittedly a polished, Windows 8-like kind of ugly, not a low-budget, no sense of aesthetics whatsoever kind of ugly) and it probably should have been broken down into a set of smaller, more focused applications. Rather than designing a program that says to users, ""Hey, let's make your audiovisual experience as cool as possible, and here's how we're going to do it,"" Cyberlink designed a program that says ""Here's a whole bunch of cool functions. Have fun."" If you know exactly what you're doing, you probably will have fun. For the rest of us ... not so much.

As an aside, for me the coolest thing about PDVD14 is the PowerDVD Remote app for Android (and iOS, I think) that allows you to control your PDVD14-powered computer with a phone or tablet. It gives you a pointer and even a keyboard. It's a little awkward to use, but for those without a well-constructed Home Theater PC setup, it's a very nice perk.

Bottom line: PowerDVD 14 Ultra is not a bad product. There's no reason to avoid it. The question is whether or not you need Cyberlink's top-of-the-line playback product. If you want the version with all the bells and whistles and you have money to burn, go for it. Most people, however, are likely to find that PowerDVD 14 Standard or a comparable product will meet all of their needs at a substantially lower cost.",Packed with features -- and perhaps a bit too packed,1403740800,,

It is Vista home premium with SP1. I rather like it. I have read numerous reviews that don't like it so much, so I am giving my experience here for those, like me, are considering a new computer with pre-installed Vista. My question was: How is Vista better than XP?

Answer: It looks better!

I am not joking. The only attraction is the aero effect thing where a little bit of each window is slightly transparent, the windows also pop up with a magical effect, like a balloon. It disappears the same way too, with some transparency worked in. It has an option of extra large icon that's really big if you want it, though that takes up screen space fast. The files are also a little bit open you so you can see a file or two in there, but in XP you can see stuff inside too, as many as four things, so the open trick isn't much of an improvement. Also, you can get these things called ""Vista Gadgets"" for the desktop, like a little calender or a battery charge indicator or even a quick search to amazon that just sits there as part of the desktop. Other program covers it, but otherwise it runs on its own without bothering anything.

(And why do I want a quick search to amazon, you might ask, if I already have it bookmarked as a favorite page? Well you see, you still have to click to open a webpage first before you can click your favorite. With the amazon gadget, you just type directly into it what you want, and a webpage will pop up without you having to click to open it! Really saves on the finger energy, you know?)

Other than this, there is nothing to Vista whatsoever that is different from XP. There is heightened security measures in the form of ""OS fearfulness"", but I always disable those things as much as possible because they are nothing but a nuisance. Whenever you want to do something it asks, ""Are you sure?"" It can't tell if something is wrong, mind you. It just keep asking YOU, and you have to keep assuring it like it is a scared child. And I can't disable all of it because then it nags constantly, ""Security setting is set too low! Please raise it!""

There are a few minor inconveniences. First, the standard picture viewer will not display GIF images, unlike the one in XP. The help part explicitely states that the viewer will ONLY display bmp and jpg format pictures. Also, the Windows Mail, the equivalent of Outlook Express, no longer has the contact pane where you can just double click any contacts and opening a black email to write. You have to open the contact file each time.

Also, the included Internet Explorer has a ton of problems. It freezes every time I go to my hotmail account. I know, they are both Microsoft, so why can't they get along? Who knows. It freezes on certain other sites too, for no particular reason. I don't have any trouble with the old IE in XP, but Vista does not allow you to downgrade. (My Netscape in Vista manages hotmail and other pages just fine, so that's what I use.)

A friend warned that my old programs might not install in Vista. I've installed a few now. So far, everything works.

So here is the conclusion: except for the pretty translucent aero effect, Vista is identical to XP in every way if you don't think about the few bugs. So if you are into pretty (like me), do get it. It looks cool! It's fun watching the windows pop open and then vanish when you close it! But if you think that sounds stupid, then there is no question XP with SP2 is better in the sense that it is more stable and have fewer bugs.

I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed that the aero thing is all that I am getting out of a brand new operating system. Considering how long it took Microsoft to work on Vista, I thought it'd be a lot more exciting. Maybe they have been concentrating on programming ""Are you sure"" into every move anybody makes. Back when I upgraded from Windows 95 to XP, there were a so many fun new impressive things to enjoy.

** CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE 10/29/09 **
It seems that a lot of upgraders have been complaining about the upgrade process, especially from XP. Most of us expected to be able to format our hard disks and be prompted for either the XP disc or product key. Alas, this is not the case. The upgrade is much more complicated than it should be and some workarounds have been discovered

Method A (simplest)
If you already have an older version of Windows on the hard drive, finish the Custom Install,  without entering the product key.  After installation, go to your System Properties and click the link to activate Windows.  Enter your product key and it should activate.  This has worked for me twice.

Method B (hardest)
If Method A doesn't work, try the registry hack.
1. Finish the custom install without entering the product key then click Start and type regedit.exe into the ""Search programs and files"" box.
2. In the registry, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/.  In the pane on the right, you'll see an entry for MediaBootInstall.  Double-click on it and change the value from ""1"" to ""0"" and click OK.
3. Close regedit and go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories then right-click on Command Prompt and select ""Run as administrator.""  You'll get a UAC alert, click Yes.
4. At the command prompt, type: slmgr /rearm and hit Enter.  Reboot.
5. Now try to activate.  If it fails, make sure there are no pending Windows Updates to install.  If there is, install them, reboot and start over from Step 4.

Method C (most time consuming)
Perform the Custom Install and skip the product key. Once completed, run the upgrade again from within Windows 7 but this time, enter the Windows 7 upgrade key and then activate Windows.
** END UPDATE **

I had been running the Windows 7 release candidate for 3 months and the full version 2 weeks before official release date.  The experience convinced me to finally upgrade my Windows XP systems to 7.  This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.

PERFORMANCE & STABILITY
One of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.

64-BIT
I am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.

DESKTOP
At first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have ""pinned"" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.

LIBRARIES
Windows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.

NETWORKING
Even as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.

SECURITY
Security in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender.  Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton/dp/B002L7BR20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton</a>.  User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions.  Coming from XP however, it is still annoying.  Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives.  Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt.

POWER MANAGEMENT
Power management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.

WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER
I've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.

WINDOWS XP MODE
For applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode. Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.  XP Mode is available in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Professional/dp/B002DHGM50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Professional</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Ultimate/dp/B002DHLV8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;editions.

RECOMMENDATION
If you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading.  Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements.  For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice.  If you decide on Windows 7 Home Premium and need to upgrade more than one PC, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Upgrade-Family-Pack/dp/B002MV2MG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack</a>, which is an excellent deal.  I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional.  I suggest a clean install for best results.  If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.

SUMMARY
Windows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for.  It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use.  Windows 7 will make your old system feel fresh and new again.  New system owners with Windows 7 pre-loaded can feel confident that they're getting the best Windows OS ever produced.",Here Comes Windows 7,1256169600,126,

If all you did was look at Microsoft Vista it would be the perfect operating system indeed.  Unfortunately Vista is a computer operating system that was designed to be used and there is the problem.  Vista is so secure and so over burdened with layers upon burdensome processor power robbing layer of sheer garbage it is rendered totally completely and utterly useless.

Vista will take the fastest XP computer and turn it into a slow worthless pile of trash.  Vista is so slow it takes me back to the days when I used to walk away from my IBM AT computer get a cup of coffee and walk around the building.  What makes Vista worse still is Microsoft Office 2007 the absolute pits in word processing.  Add Office 2007 to Vista and you won't be productive at all but dang won't it look pretty. If you just want to watch your computer make pretty colors and areo-glass catch yourself some goofs watch Vista.  When you want to work and be productive turn on your XP computer.  Windows 2000 and XP work hard while Vista Hardly Works at all.  Vista is garbage don't buy this dreck!

Everything you try to do on Vista is not allowed.  Almost every peice of equipment you run on Vista needs to be updated to so called Vista friendly versions.  The messed up Windows explorer to the point to where it is beyond useless.  The problem with Vista is that Microsoft had taken all the wizards and helpful features far as they could in XP.  In Vista they had to try to top a operating system that pretty much did what you asked of it with little fuss.  In Vista the software code writers were just changing things because they could.  Vista makes nothing better or easier.  In fact Vista is built in a manner that almost seems to go out of its way to make even the most simple compater related tasks unpleasant needlessly long boring and tedious.

In a word TEDIOUS IS THE BEST SINGLE WORD TO DESCRIBE MICROSOFT WINDOWS VISTA.  VISTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THE ENTIRE COMPUTER EXPERIENCE IS PAINFULLY NEW LEVEL OF THE PURELY TEDIOUS THAT HAS NOT BEEN DREAMT OF BEFORE!  I just wish I could give Vista no stars or more honestly a negative star rating.  I won't be buying Vista for my current systems and even when I get a new computer I will not be using Vista is it comes pre installed.  I have my own old trusty XP disks and I will reinstalled XP the last useful usable operating system Microsoft made.

XP is the goofy kiddie skool like interface is ugliest operating system Microsoft ever made but while it was an ugly duckling it did work pretty well.  Vista is by far the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever made but it is pretty and dumb.  Vista is over burdened with programmatic junk has a way to high opinion of itself.  Vista is so much more secure because all the dumb security features make the operating system unusable.  Any computer you make unusable is the most secure because you can't do any productive work on it.  Vista makes your computer experience endlessly tedious and makes your computer system a must see door stop.  The philosophy of Vista seems to be that a good computer should be seen but never productively used.  Vista is a great system for that  well monied executive that wants to look busy while doing nothing productive.",Windows 2000 and XP Worked Well while Vista Hardly Works AT ALL!!!!!,1175040000,13,

I am running windows XP, service pack 2, and have installed all the MS security updates.

I will avoid repeating what others have said other than the conversion went basically flawless.  That is why i gave a rating of 5 stars.  I have a Dell laptop that i initially updated to Qucken premier 2010 to make sure there were no problems and made backup CD's and then restored them to the laptop before converting my desktop to 2010.  All went well with the backup and restore to the laptop. I have a desktop dell machine that is 5 years old that I mainly run quicken on, the laptop is my backup pc.

All went well with the upgrade with no problems that i can see both on the laptop and desktop.  I checked my account totals, reports, and they all matched up with what I had on quicken 2007.  Keep in mind that I also agree that year to year changes are minor and did not upgrade to 2010 until the last minute as my quicken 2007 support will end next month (no more online updates).  The on line account download for my visa account also went well along will all the other online accounts (about 6).  All the accounts updated without any problems.

When restoring from a backup of 2010 that i made on my laptop to the desktop dell, I did find some confusing issues.  I had a difficult time getting the quicken file (only one now with 2010) from my backup CD to the quicken directory on the desktop.  The program asks you where you want the file restored to.  I said the qucken directory.  When i selected that directory a bunch of old qdf files popped up to select from but not the most current 2010 file I had on the backup CD that I backed up from quicken 2010 was not listed.

I use quicken mainly for updating by checking account and visa accounts and do not use a lot of the other functionality of the program, so i maybe use only 10% of the program functionality.

I will provide an update if I run into any significant problems but so far it has been perfect.  I had no reason to upgrade other than the 3 year sunset rule quicken has for support which really means the online download will not work anymore if you do not upgrade.

After an hour or so I do no see any significant changes from Premier 2007 in 3 years other than some things have been shifted around and there are some new information screens.  I would not upgrade unless your 3 year time period is running out.

I would also recommend testing the upgrade on a similar pc is you use more than one PC before you delete your old version of quicken.

Save your money and wait as long as you can before upgrading and when you do upgrade to a new version wait at least 9 months for the bugs to get fixed.

UPDATE:  It has been a couple of weeks now since installing Quicken and all is going well with no major issues.  I have found that the Live Community Help is outstanding.  Type in a question and it usually has been answered.  Their search feature is very good as your question brings up very relevant answers to your problems.  I use Quicken 95% of the time for managing my Visa and bank accounts and doing budget reports.  Everything has worked almost flawlessly including reconciling bank accounts, backups and transaction downloads and reports.

There were a couple of quirky things that I needed help on: 1) Future bills would not show up in my register; 2) Preferences would not stay saved after restarting Quicken; 3) Quicken would not start on my bank account.  All the problems were solved through live community as people already found the answer for them.  I just needed to use classic view and change a couple of preference settings.

There is one quirky problem.  When you backup the backup file name is limited to 31 characters.  When i rename the backupfile the some of the preferences revert back to the default values after I get the file name too long error message.  I like to have my checking account show up as the home page.  With 2010 you need to use the classic view.  The backup issued caused my home page to go to the quicken default.  Also my billminder is shown on my accounts as a prefence and goes away also.  It takes a few minutes to restore the preferences that were lost once you know what to do.",Flawless upgrade from Quicken Premier 2007,1271635200,4,

I thought this would be a good addendum to help them with the Class.  I have done the Danish and German Rosetta Stones in the past.  I did get a lot out of the German one but I had taken a German class in college.  The Danish one not so well as my pronounciation of Scandanavian vowels is lacking.  Fortunately the Danes speak American English.

The Mandarin course is a bit different in that it teaches Chinese Letters too though you can decide to do the entire course using only the Roman alphabet.  I found the software can be as easy or as Challenging as you wish.

The Course is presented in three sections.  A basic, intermediate, and more advanced sections.  You create a profile for yourself and based on your age and gender the software will compensate for you on its voice recognition software.

The best thing about the course is the voice recognition.  You say the words and the system tell you if you are correct.  I can't pronounce English very well so I'm not quite sure how accurate it is.

The Basic course is pretty simple.  It teaches you touristy things like eating, walking, running, cooking, and the differences in gender.  I like rosetta stone because it emmerses you in the language.  It doesn't try to translate.  You infer from the pictures what you are saying.

The courses get harder and harder as you go along.  I found I tend to forget what I learned in the class if I try to remember but pick it up again immediately when confronted with it in real life.

I would reccomend it highly for someone just looking for a simple tool to introduce them to the Chinese alphabet and Mandarin.  I thought it and the other courses I got to be well worth it.",For My Family it is a Great extention for what they are learning in School.,1260489600,,

INSTALLATION:

Download went smoothly (as expected) and then it was time to install the software on (5) Windows PCs running XP, Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8 and two running 8.1 as an operating system.  All of the installs went off without a hitch and Webroot SecureAnywhere  is running quietly in the background.

FIRST SCANS:

On the XP PC the first scan snagged several virus'.  This PC had formerly been using AVG Free.

On the Windows 8 PC it had been using AVAST Free, and the first scan with Webroot found a virus.

On the two Windows 8.1 PCs which both had trial versions; one of Norton and one of Kaspersky, no virus' were found upon the initial scan with Webroot.

On the Windows 7 PC no virus' were found.  It had been using Webroot SecureAnywhere 2013; subscription had just run out.

WHY GET THIS SOFTWARE?

1. 'Always on' protection for enhanced internet security on all your devices.
2. No need to mess with it once it's installed.
3. Protects against virus', malware, phishing, identity theft, cybe rcrime, social network threats, and unsafe websites.
4. Warns before you click!
5. Manages passwords for you.
6. 25GB of FREE online storage across your (5) devices is included.
7. Protection on Facebook and Twitter.
8. System analysis to detect system issues.
9. Can wipe history and make deleted files unrecoverable.
10 Automatically scans Android apps and downloads.
11. Can remotely lock and wipe data from smartphones and tablets, and help to locate stolen devices.
12. GREAT price for protecting all that on (5) devices for 1 year!

Works seemed to find non existent problems and used lots of resources. Since Norton Anti-Virus cost just about the same price as Systems works did I opted for one of the free anti-virus programs (Avast) and was very happy. I also have a Mac and use no Norton software on it.

Recently I obtained a new HP Vista computer and was happily running Avast on it with no problems. But I missed several programs I had on my XP system that did things like defrag my hard drive, keep track of my passwords, etc. So when this program became available in the Amazon Vine program and I noticed it had those separate programs that I had by other companies now incorporated all into one program called Norton 360 I decided to give it a try.

I had no problem loading the software and it seemed to configure effortlessly upon it's first start up. I've used all of the features on it thus far except the backup program. I am unclear as if the backup only works to the skimpy on-line disc space that comes with the product (more can be rented for what seems a fairly astronomical price). The features of the program seem to work well so far in all the areas I have tried.

I've read many of the other reviews for this program and it seems I may be praising it too soon since I've only had it installed about 3 weeks so far (on a 6 week old PC) and it seems that things begin to go sour shortly after that - we'll see. I would agree that it seems to work best with new computers with fresh Vista installations (Ultimate version in my case on a 6 week old PC). It seems to incur all sorts of problems on older systems with Vista upgrades.

So I'm taking a cautious approach and think that it's an average program that tries to do a lot, and if you have  the need or desire for these features and a fairly new computer it will probably work well for you. I can't speak for what your experience with older computers would be like.",So far it does the job but it may be too soon to tell,1215648000,3,

It's very good at that...nice to be able to easily add voiceover to video. It does some things with conversions that many of the (easier, more affordable) video editors for PC don't, so that's something, since the software choices for Mac are so limited.

While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.
The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the ""old computer,"" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).
Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.
Using XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the ""clear type"" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a ""normal"" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).
I'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).  It seems like the Microsoft engineers really gave this a lot of thought and put it into action.",I Guess I'm Lucky,1046390400,13,

Just like with the other software available from Family Tree, this software helps you build a tree, create reports, integrate with Ancestry.com, and otherwise learn more about yourself and the individuals with whom you share a common ancestry.

This version of Family Tree takes some time to install, so you might be best off just walking away from the computer for a while as it loads. If you already have an Ancestry.com account, it will take some time to import the data. About 15 minutes worked for me, and my family tree has about 8,000 members. At this point, everything is set- you just use the report tab to run reports and utilize all that the software has to offer.

For those who do not have an Ancestry.com account at present, it is easy to start building a tree. You just enter your personal information along with that of your spouse, plus parents, grandparents, etc. The software will then work its magic and start looking for matches in the database. It provides hints to review and research further, if necessary, to make sure that the hint for that person is correct.

Like other Family Tree Software, this version comes with a free membership to Ancestry.com. In this instance, the free trial is for three months, but I should caution that with this version, you have to enter a credit card number to activate the free offer. This means, of course, that you have to remember to deactivate before the end of the trial, otherwise your credit card will get charged. This is less than ideal, I admit, but it is a common way of doing business nowadays with online services.

Discovering more about ones ancestry can be fascinating and Family Tree Deluxe is a good product for this purpose. It does take a little longer to download and there is the credit card issue mentioned previously.

Even after I uninstalled KIS 2011 and rebooted, the changes it made remained. I still could not run Firefox's themes or extensions, and running tasks were still missing from Task Manager.

The interface will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has used AVG in the past couple of years.  It remains simple and clean with its intuitive three-tab design that is suitable for both experienced and new users.

COMPONENTS:
Here is a list of the three tabs, and a quick synopsis of what the components do.

Overview Tab:
  * Anti-Virus: Protection from and removal of viruses, trojans, and worms including infected .EXEs or .DLLs.
  * Anti-Spyware: Protection from and removal of spyware, malware, adware.
  * Anti-Spam: Protects against spam and phishing attempts, marking suspicious incoming email as [SPAM].
  * Firewall: Blocks or permits network traffic on a rule-by-rule, program-by-program basis. 'Gaming Mode' prevents firewall rule pop-ups from interrupting play.  Handy 'Emergency Mode' blocks all internet traffic in the event you feel you are being hacked.
  * LinkScanner: Surf-Shield and Search-Shield actively block dangerous websites and scan search engines for threats.
  * Anti-Rootkit: Searches out hidden rootkit dangers on your computer.  This scan can be scheduled separately, run with another scan, or manually started.
  * System Tools: Like Windows' Task Manager, it shows your running system processes, active network connections, etc but with security levels.
  * Email Scanner: Scans outgoing and incoming email for threats.
  * Identity Protection: Analyzes and scans your programs in an attempt to prevent the loss of personal information such as passwords and credit card info.
  * Web Shield: While using instant messaging programs, prevents you from downloading or exchanging infected files.
Resident Shield: Actively scans your files as they are opened, copied, or saved to prevent the activation of threats.
  * License: Your license info is displayed here.  This program is for a 2-year subscription for a single computer.
  * Update Manager: Set it and Forget it.  Automatically keeps the program up-to-date.

Computer Scanner Tab:
  * It's now easier than ever to setup and maintain scans that suit your time and liking.  Want to scan for viruses, adware, and spyware on Monday at 2:00pm, and then scan for Rootkits on Wednesday at 11am?  It's simple to set it all up here, however and whenever you want.

Update Tab:
  * Click this tab to begin a manual update of the program and its components.

IMPRESSIONS:
The Firewall has undergone major improvement.  It is less obtrusive than the previous version, automatically creating rules for trusted programs/access without bothering you with any annoying 'stop everything and attend to me' pop-ups.  The Computer Scanner interface tab now shines for its easy to use scheduling of single or multiple scans, manual scans of your computer, or manual scans of just selected files.  The Virus Vault and the History could still use some work, but they are perfectly functional as is.

CONCLUSION:
I've used AVG free and paid versions for many years, and I think this version of their internet suite is  the best yet.  It's easy to install, runs great on my Windows 7 64-bit, is full-featured without bloatware, has a clean and simple interface for beginners, yet still allows experienced users to tweak the nuts and bolts to their liking.",An Improvement over the Previous Version,1259884800,,

It's not quite as polished and doesn't look as slick.  For example, updates aren't as seamlessly hidden as with Turbotax.  I even got a disturbing error message after the last program update.  I'm sure it's still fine, the program doesn't seem to be acting differently, but the last thing you want is a glitch in your tax software.  Probably going to wait for the next update on 2/15/16 and see if it gives any errors then.  Frankly, I'd just rather wait for updates in the first couple months on any tax software before submitting anyway.

So yeah, for cheaper cost and a company that I don't think is going to turn around and try to screw me, if only because they are a distant second in market share, it's well worth the money.  I have no qualms about suggesting it for anything but the most complicated of tax returns.

--Update 02/10/16--
I got the same error again for the state tax return.  It read No TaxDataStoreHandel found for TaxDataStore (see TaxDataMgr::getTaxDataStoreHandle()).  Not good since this is the second time.  I checked their support and they said to make sure anti-virus, firewall, etc. are off, no Windows Updates pending, and such, but I could tell it wasn't one of those.  Their help site wording is a little ambiguous, but did ultimately point me in the right direction after a couple minutes.  Go to Tools/Update the Program, click Next, then the hyperlink for What's included and which forms are final in the current state update?.  Browser will open and scrolling down will lead to the manual update area.  Couple more click and done deal.  No errors after updating that way.",Great Tax Software,1454284800,4,

Coming from a more robust version of Norton's anti-virus software to this version has proved an easy transition though not one without hiccups.

--------------------
INSTALLATION:

I received the physical disk format, however, after installing the disk and starting the installation wizard the recommended method was internet download... go figure. So I went along with that route and very quickly >15min downloaded and proceeded installing my software. Strangely the first time I entered my authentication code Norton's site indicated that my code had been previously used. I tried the code again about 20 minutes later and it worked. I should mention that if you have any anti-virus software already installed you should go ahead and uninstall it anyway as Norton will prompt you to do so.

Note that you will be prompted to create an account Norton/Symantec during installation.

--------------------
USE:

The Internet Security user interface (UI) is very familiar to me. It is basically populated with some easy to identify tiles: 'Secure' (color coded to indicate threats on your machine; green = good; 'Scan Now' which brings up a sub-menu for all types of system security scans; 'Live Update' for downloading the latest security definitions and patches; 'Advanced' for configuration. The tiles also display pertinent information including CPU usage (monitoring for spikes which are an indicator of a potential rogue application) and even when the latest definitions were downloaded and installed. The UI is good, easy to navigate, and unobtrusive.

I have this software installed on 3 machines - my primary desktop that has a SSD, 4-disc RAID storage array, and a networked NAS; along with two laptops all running Windows 7. I've found that Norton has done a great job on each system. Scan times vary, however, on my 300Gb SSD a full scan takes approximately 40-minutes for reference.

As I was already and have continuously used anti-virus software I didn't find any surprises on my systems after running my initial post-installation scans.

--------------------
USAGE NOTES:

It's perhaps just my impression but it seems that software companies tend to treat their customers a bit poorly on licensing. Norton is no exception. This software is licensed to you, you don't ""own"" it rather than lease a window of operation. That's fine and something that we've all sort of become accustomed to, however, the major problem is that this software will stop operating completely once it's 365 day operating license (the day you activate the key) is up. Prior to 2010 (as far as I can remember) Norton software would at least keep functioning outside of the subscription period though obviously not getting new updates and definitions.

The bottom line, and this is true for a lot of software and particularly anti-virus software is that you're going to have a costly bill due every year whether from Norton, Trend Micro, McAfee or whatever security company. You can mitigate this somewhat by buying last years anti-virus product. As long as the activation code hasn't been used you should be good to go. Remember that your license period doesn't start on the calendar year but only after the key is activated.

--------------------
ISSUES:

I don't usually install a lot of extensions in my browser but for some reason went ahead with Norton's Internet Security extension. This was a mistake! I'm a Chrome user and noticed that my browser immediately become slower, and prone to frequent crashes that killed every open tab. I had nothing but issues with the browser extension so I do not recommend using it, especially if you're a Chrome user!

--------------------
CONCLUSION:

Norton delivers another solid release of their seminal anti-virus software. Performance is good, obtrusiveness is kept at a relative minimum. Be wary of renewing online through Norton as you'll always pay top-dollar. Recommended with caveats.",Norton Delivers Solid Software,1385337600,19,

Just as well, because it was a more or less positive review and now, even though I have fibromyalgia and typing hurts, I'd rather be in pain than use Dragon Naturally Speaking.  First of all, while it will run on all but the oldest computers, it slows everything way down.  Try running it while you've got anti-virus software running and the lag time after you dictate is really annoying, especially when you realize it's garbled what you said quite badly, or made strange choices among homophones.  It has a particularly bad time with a standard American accent. It does much better if you speak with an exaggerated New York accent (think Mike Meyers doing ""Coffee Talk"" on SNL).  Otherwise, if you pronounce ""dawn"" and ""Don"" the same, it will choose Don everytime, even if the context doesn't make sense.  It's probably great for dictating things like book reports using simple, common words and not too many names or capitalized terms, but if you are dictating something complex or with a lot of specialized terms or abbreviations, or defined terms that are capitalized, it leaves a lot to be desired.  And you've got to get it right the first time, because moving around within a document to edit is downright irritating, especially if you want to correct a word that appears multiple times.  It's supposed to get better the longer you use the program and the more it gets ""trained,"" but honestly it just gets worse.  The program also has an annoying habit of thinking ordinary dictation is a command word and opening up a pull-down menu when you least expect or want it to.

If you really can't type, it's better than nothing, but unless you also use a headset for voice over internet applications, you'll probably want to get a desktop microphone for use with this -- the headset that comes with the software isn't comfortable for extended periods of time and the standard software doesn't work with BlueTooth headsets.  I haven't used this program in a really long time.  It's just too frustrating, so unless I am writing something really long, I'd rather hurt a little.

I have previously used a Garman GPS 60cs for hiking and such, but even as it's great for tracking in the wilderness it doesn't have near the detail that newer, larger, more street driving, oriented GPS's have.  But, it has a good signal and is pretty rugged.  That's the comparison.  The USB GPS provided took a bit bit longer than my Garmin to find the location, but when it did it was pretty surprisingly accurate.  It was very easy to install on my XP laptop, and really worked well in tracking movement and location.  The first time I plugged it in I was in the living room of a 1st floor apartment.  The signal didn't seem to go through the walls very well, and it couldn't pick anything up. That's to be expected.  Outside that location, everything worked perfect.  Easily linked up with the Streets & Trips.

A lot of details have already been given about Streets and Trips itself. I have used Garmin's software--both their North America Streets version and their Western National Parks/Forests version.  I've also become quite a fan of google maps, with occasional use of the other versions.  The major benefit, of course, to Streets and Trips is that unlike Google or the others it doesn't depend on an internet connection.  The major benefit, of course, of another Garmin or other type of GPS is that even this version packaged with the GPS is significantly cheaper--if you have a laptop already.

The software is easy to use and intuitive.  I need to poke around more but I've been pretty satisfied so far. The list of interesting places is very good, as is the overall maps and associated tools. I've not used previous versions of Streets and Trips, so I can't compare this particular version to previous ones.

The one big issue I have with it, that has me using Google a lot in short, one-stop trips is that there doesn't seem to be a way of rerouting the directions.  With Google, a little cursor click and move can shift the route to something that might be preferred for whatever reason. Living in the LA area, as I do, there are a lot of ways to get from here to there, and a lot of reasons why what might seem on paper to be the best isn't at all the best.  The only other downside isn't to do with the software, but instead having to bring my laptop with me places.  Meaning this really is something that I'd use a lot for longer trips, but not as much for the shorter ones.

I loved art class in school because I had a whole room full of supplies, though I hated cleaning up. I was really looking forward to using this software because it simulates all of that messy stuff which is fun to use but not convenient. Fun times ahead!

It's mostly a fairly straightforward painting/editing program, but it has a whole ton of ""brushes"", both simulated real art tools (paint brushes, pens, spatulas, airbrushing, etc) and some wacky fun stuff like the ""image hose"" which lays down a trail of objects. If you're a skilled hand artist, or planning to become one, many of the brush types will be very useful in creating digital images which do look very much like they were created with brush, pen, or sponge strokes.

However, for what I expected to be a pretty high-end piece of software, I was disappointed with some quirks.

To avoid using the word ""tool"" (often used to refer to editing tools) and also avoid calling everything a ""brush"", I will refer to all simulated things as implements.

Some of the implements are too perfect and constant, and obvious patterns show. The ""loaded palette knife 2"" strokes with a pattern you might expect from a scraping painter's knife, but it NEVER CHANGES, down to the pixel. And unlike some of the other implements, there's no rounding or smoothing of the stroke to make it look convincing. It's exactly what you would get by copying and dragging a row of pixels in a paint program on an old DOS box. See the uploaded image, it's loaded with patterned artifacts. Utterly useless. Some others had similar problems, but I remembered this knife as the worst.

Some implements which rotate to match the stroke direction have a similar problem. They are completely 2-dimensional, and while they make delightful swirls of texture, they ALWAYS start and end with a completely flat row of pixels, just as no object in the univers would if used to draw. Again, it looks like the obvious result of a paint program.

One feature I was initially happy to see is the ability to zoom in with the mouse's scroll wheel. Why that isn't universal I have no idea, and being a detail hawk I am constantly zooming in and out at various points. Great! But it's silly, because using your scroll wheel will only zoom in to the exact center of your screen. The program doesn't care where your cursor is! So you have to first drag over to center whatever area you want to zoom in on. How did they not think to make it zoom in on the area I am pointing at? Yes, I can drag to the area first, but zooming in & out is something I might do literally hundreds of times while working on one image.

I was not able to figure out why trying to pick the crop tool sometimes jumps my focus down to the canvass layer, which is surely the last layer anyone would want to crop and move. Unlike some other things, there was no popup telling me why it didn't want to let me crop the paint layer.

Here's another silly thing. The escape key does not un-select things. If you use the select tool, and have the dotted box around an area then either perform some action or change your mind, you want to un-select the area. In every other program I have used, either ESC or ENTER will unselect the area and let you move on with your life, which is handy because you can draw with your right hand and hit keys like that with your left. In Corel, you have to use the ""reset tool"" on the menu bar. Again, it might not seem like a big deal but it interrupts the flow of an action you might do hundreds of times while working on a serious project. And it's not like the ESC key does anything else.

And finally, though the number of tools is impressive at first, it's all about buying upgrades. Want more brushes? Hand over a chunk of cash. It looks like the ""image hose"" is the same, and you can only use leaves and tires so many times before your work looks like a child got on your computer when you weren't there.  When the program first started, this really convenient learning interface popped up. Oh good, something to get me started! Not really, they're all ""30 lecture"" bundles you have to buy. No free 5-minute intro to using Corel's mediocre interface.

Overall, it's got some good stuff. But don't think you're buying into some great thing. They think they're selling you a bare-bones system, some of which can be addressed with upgrades and some maybe not.",Expected better,1447372800,9,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R--+XleWL._SY88.jpg']

I do video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro CC so I wasn't expecting a huge amount of features, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how much WAS offered when in Advanced Editing Mode... the library has quite a decent set of transitions, overlays, text editing and control of background music. Obviously there are pro features missing (such as shaping the envelope of a transition) but honestly, you can produce quite good output with the NLE. The output options are numerous too, where you can either pick a specific resolution (720, 1080) or simply pick the device that your project is intended for.

I tested the ""Create video from webpage function and it does work. The utility windows shows what video it's capturing from the webpage you are playing it on. However, bad news and this isn't Roxio's fault: it doesn't work with YouTube. YT constantly changes where temp video is staged while its playing plus they hide it deeper and deeper every month it seems. So this software won't capture YT but not many can.

The real power of Creator 13 is the media handling... you have every option to burn and copy DVDs and CDs including options to write the image to the hard drive first for more stable data (always check that box) as well as verify the disc afterwards (always do that too, although it adds time). You can open ISos and burn them right to disc, make data discs and assemble and produce audio CDs. This module alone is worth its price, not many utilities give you all of the options for  data and media handling.

Not So Good: format conversion. I took an .MP4 of a music video that was in 1080p and told Creator to convert it to iPhone 6 Plus format. When I previewed the new file the audio was out of sync. That may not happen for every format, but it'd take quite a while to test every conversion format. Since I have Adobe Media Encoder I'll use that, but for the general audience who doesn't subscribe to the Adobe tools, I'd look elsewhere for video conversion. Apple Quicktime Pro is a good start.

For the money it's a pretty good package, the file and disc handling and the web capture are the redeeming features. The Free Movie Maker on Windows along with QuickTime Pro would handle media creation and conversion but you wouldn't have the disc authoring ability (Menu page on a DVD for instance) nor the disc features, so as an all-in-one solution that won;t break the bank, this one is working well on my Windows 8.1 PC (i3 running on an SSD and 16GB ram).",Couple of Quirks but Overall Good Package,1419897600,,

I now am changing over to all Norton Internet Security products (which contains antivirus software) for my various computers.  [Kaspersky got a little crazy and didn't always launch per an error message I would get on the next reboot and when it did launch it took a long time so I couldn't go right to the Internet.]

I first used Norton Antivirus 2014 which installs in minutes but which does not help with all of the problems a user's computer runs into so I changed over to Norton Internet Security 2014 so that I would have the most secure computing environment.

Installation took a little longer but then the program uninstalls your old program if you want.  It took about 40 minutes for my ""old"" Dell Vostro 1000 (2007) laptop but took a much shorter time with my newer HP (2013) Notebook.  I like that the program checks for new definitions and updates your computer and you don't even notice it.  At least I didn't.  With a minimum of settings you are on your way and don't have to worry while you are working or on a website.

In regard to installing - the instructions recommend that you download from the Norton website - that way you get the most up-to-date software ""Always up-to-date"" and ""Automatically updates to the latest version.""  ""You can still use your CD to use as a recovery disk to remove malicious software.""

The console has Secure which is green when everything is hunky-dory and shows CPU Usage: System and Norton percentages as well as Trust level (which I don't know what that means). Then is Scan Now which always tells you when you last scanned your computer (manually or automatically), Live Update (mine just now showed ""4 minutes ago"" - it is automatic, too), Advanced: which has settings for Computer Protection (Scan  Now, History, Quarantine, Norton Insight, Run Live Update - and has toggles for choosing Insight Protections, Antivirus, Antispyware, SONAR Protection), Network Protection (Network Security Map: Toggles for Smart Firewall, Intrusion Protection and Email Protection) and Web Protection which has Norton Family and Identity Safe. All of these items are by default toggled to ON but you can change them.

At the bottom of the console, no matter what screen you are on, are: Subscription Status (how many days are left for your subscription and ""renew""), Zone (Norton Zone - Free Cloud Access from any device), Manage (devices, subscriptions, updates and more), Mobile, Family and Backup.

This is more a ""set and forget"" program and yet you can check on a lot of things and set up when you want updates and /or scans, etc.

WinZip can now convert doc, docx (Word files), xls, xlsx (Excel files) and ppt, pptx (PowerPoint files) by selecting the Convert to PDF box in the Create tab and simply dragging your document into the work area. That alone is fantastic. By selecting options beforehand, you can encrypt your files (Winzip wipes and deletes any temporary files so they cannot be recovered, great protection option). You can right click and create zip files straight from Windows Explorer, sort columns by clicking on headers, processes files such as RAR, 7Z, ISO, IMG, BZ2, BZ, TBZ,TBZ2, TAR, Z, GZ, TGZ, LZH, LHA, CAB, UUencode, BinHex & MIME files. There are even iOS & Android apps for Apple & Google devices. You can resize images (great for compressing large photos). You can even add Watermarks to your Files with the extensions of BMP, GIF, JPG, PDF, PNG and TIF. The toolbars are very easy to use and are context sensitive, adapting to the task you are working on. Another great new feature is sharing with your social media accounts. You can post any type of file to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn with ZipShare. You can also send large files up to 2GB from your email account with ZipSend.  For me the best new feature is the access to cloud files. WinZip will connect to Dropbox, SkyDrive, Box and Google Drive. You can save a ton of space by zipping files to your cloud accounts or extracting to them. File compression can be customized to your specifications and is quick and fast. I love being able to convert documents to quick PDFs (no it doesn't have the features of Acrobat or Create PDF, but it gets the job done if you need an Office document converted to share or send). The Cloud integration is excellent. Just link WinZip to the service or services you use and you can zip or extract to them in a few minutes. WinZip makes the setup for this a breeze. This is particularly good for large size files or photos since extra space costs $$. I have used WinZip before and this new edition is the best ever. While many complain about the cost, WinZip is really an excellent product. I have tried several other compression programs like 7Zip (shareware) and Power Archiver. 7Zip for me is a great hassle. We have it at work and it is useless because even though it is installed on some machines, co-workers have a difficult time opening files so I never use it. When we had WinZip, everything ran smoothly. It may not be the most advanced compression option, the Pro Version has more advanced features, but it is certainly the easiest to use and the new features make it worth it. Connection  to the Cloud drives and quick PDF conversion are the features I use most often and it is fast and easy.

For users who are thinking about upgrading from previous iterations of this program perhaps its time to start looking anew as most of the upgrades from versions 8 or 9 are somewhat minimal and not essential in my books.

One of the chief problems with this software suite is that while it excels at providing a solution for just about every media task the average home user needs on their computers the truth of the matter is that with a bit of digging around their are far better (and oftentimes free) software out there that makes some of Roxio's package seem awkward and out of date.

It sold decently well because it was nearly free to run year after year as long as you didn't mind inputting changes manually. That meant it was the go to for old school paper and calculator types. While the fancier, easy to use Quickbooks Pro was sold to the masses who wanted things more automated.

Enter the all new Peachtree for 2013--Sage 50. A lot more than just the name changed. The biggest change is that while more features are streamlined, many now cost extra like Payroll and updated tax tables. Removing the options for manually inputting updates, Sage 50 is now trying to target the Quickbooks Pro crowd. The problem is that this is very much still a work in process. It isn't as automated nor as easy to use as Quickbooks Pro yet. My feeling is that they should have moved into this market softer by charging for addons but keeping the cost much lower to get customers used to paying for such services.

They basically took the single ""feature"" from Quickbooks Pro that users complain about (random features that are required for almost everyone costing extra) and adopted it here. The problem is such changes likely to scare off current customers who used Peachtree for value (Think JCPennys recently) without bringing in new customers (because there is no real reason to select this over QuickBooks for most people).

So why three stars? Because it works if you don't mind paying for extra features and it is a decent sized leap over the Peachtree's of the past.

* Though it can import recipes from ""Mastercook,"" the recipes must be INDIVIDUALLY exported then imported.  If you have a backup of mastercook files, this will not work; you need the mastercook software to.
* There is no automatic calculating of nutrition data; it has to be manually re-entered after entering ingredients
* The interface looks crude and outdated; something reminiscent of cookbooks sold for $9.99 in the 1990s.

PROS:
Um....none.

For the newbies out there, I was up and running with a character in about 10 minutes, with the caveat that I completed the two things in the paragraph below first!

The package contains PC and Mac DVD-ROMs. I have a blazing fast PC with 18GB of RAM, striped drives, and an Intel 990x processor.  So, installation was fairly quick and painless. I took the opportunity to read the included quick reference card while the software was loading so that I could have a basic familiarity with the software interface.  Also, I did a little picking/choosing of some tutorial videos at Lynda.com that covered an older version to have a basic understanding of what exactly Poser is and does before the software arrived.

The background work was quite beneficial and as stated I was up and running with a basic character in about 10 minutes. Poser is a program in which you create, pose, and animate 3D characters with pre-built libraries of characters, props, clothing, hair, ad-infinitum. You also have control of lighting and cameras as one would expect with anything 3D. Then you pose them as you wish or animate them to use in various other software programs to create art of all sorts.  I found the interface to be fairly intuitive and is like so many other tabbed interfaces in software I currently use. You start with a fairly featureless character in the main window then start adding features, lighting, body type, etc. One can then start to pose the character. Of course this is the 10,000 foot view as there are many controls to fine tune everything and are out of the scope of a review.

There are many sites that sell characters, props, clothing, hair, and the like to help you create just about anything having to do with a character! This is quite helpful, especially for those under time constraints or that may not be savvy enough to create their own in other content creation programs such as a 3D program or Photoshop.  I see this as no different than using stock photos/illustrations/characters in the art one creates, so it didn't bother me.

I have not animated a character yet, but that is on the agenda for the near future.  Having never used the program before I cannot speak to whether it is a worthwhile upgrade from an earlier version, but many professional reviewers think so. I think the price is reasonable. SmihMicro has three levels of this program: Poser Debut, that while being less powerful and feature packed is quite a bit less money and may serve as an entry level into the Poser family; Poser 9 which I am using/reviewing here; and Poser Pro 2012 which has all of the features of Poser 9 and many more pro-level features.

I think because I was able to be up and running so quickly, though at a basic level, that Poser 9 is a great asset to any artist or hobbyist wanting to add 3D characters to the art they create but have nothing to create said characters with. If you are a 3D neophyte that has wanted to try Poser but have been holding back on getting it because you thought it would be overwhelming or you felt you just plain didn't have time to learn it...I say go for it!",Great Software,1319673600,,

I find the software incredibly intuitive to learn and use, and while there's a LOT of review, it definitely drums things into your head. I also like the diversity used in the photos -- OK, sometimes it's a little surprising to have a picture of a man who's clearly Central Asian when you're in the middle of your Italian lesson, but people from all ethnicities speak all different languages in this jet-setting world, so I guess it really shouldn't seem all that unusual!

Other times, we're positive that we're pronouncing the words correctly, but it doesn't think we are. The one that came with my Spanish set seems to work better than the one that came with the Italian set, for some reason. Considering the cost of the program, a more reliable headset would be nice.

No more trying to juggle time zones so that we can do a file transfer, no worries about files being diverted or inadvertently accessed by unauthorized computers either.  We send it, and the information on retrieval can be given to the recipient via telephone, fax, email or even text messages.  They retrieve it at a convenient time, and everyone is happy.

It's reliable.  We've not had a single file become corrupted or lost.  With 100% accuracy, we feel secure in the knowledge that the file will arrive intact, giving us peace of mind.

I had never bothered to try AVG Internet Security (AVG IS), mainly because it is an expensive package in comparison to most of the other offerings on the market. That said, it is a solid product and worth consideration in spite of the cost.

I should start by stating, for the record, that I had a dreadful install experience. AVG IS partially installed itself and then errored out. After a reboot, AVG IS was alive but outdated, and what was broken was the ability to update. Worse, the uninstall was also broken. After getting the uninstall ironed out, I tried to install again and this time everything was much smoother.

AVG IS is organized and clean with a very clear and easy-to-understand overview dashboard. At a glance you can tell what is active and what is not active. Double-clicking on any of the icons in this view gives access to adjustment controls by which the component in question can be manipulated and set as desired. I like this particular view. One thing that is not clear, though, is that to get to the real nuts and bolts of the various components' configurations, one must use the pull-down menus, not the icons.

AVG's firewall appears to do a good job of hiding the system on the net, locking down service ports and cutting off ping responses. I was unable to break it. However, where it gets interesting is in the control afforded the user - individual applications can be locked down, policies set for different networks, and so much more. Other firewalls do this, but AVG's organization in the interface is better than average.

AVG's track record as an antivirus vendor is well known. However, with versions prior to 9.0 their antivirus was slow, intrusive and hard to interrupt. AVG seems to have gotten the idea of how to improve this - it took about 90 minutes to scan over 1,000,000 items if you include the registry and even running at full speed I hardly noticed except for the fact that I had the task manager open and saw an occasional spike in CPU activity. I launched several applications, typed a lot, and even searched for a file on the hard drive and saw no real impact on the system. Cycles consumed seemed to be consistently under 10%.

AVG throws a lot of other things into the mix that you'd expect in a decent suite - antispam, antispyware, rootkit detection, and several other components. What surprised me was to find a process viewer that has the ability to kill processes, accessible from the dashboard under system tools. I have never worked with a security suite with that built-in as part of the package. Included is a connectivity viewer and even a startup process viewer, with the ability to manipulate the entries within. That's a very nice plus.

I've been unable to work with the antispam up to this point, as I get no spam. Even so, there are many, many settings that can be adjusted to the antispam, such as adding a blacklist server such as spamcop to assist with checking, Bayesian training and a lot more. Based on the feature set I suspect this antispam is very effective.

AVG IS includes a McAfee-style system of evaluating returns from search engines, marking unsafe links in the results window. It is not as thorough as McAfee's Site Adviser, but it is effective in giving you  heads-up when there is a possible danger ahead.

There are two things that AVG does not have that I wish were present. First, there is no parental control module. It looks like AVG made no effort at all to include a parental controls module, and while that's ok it is something that most other security suites include.  I was unable to even find a manual block list - if it's there, I cannot find it. Second, I found no ability to see the presence of other computers on the network. It is not something that I have found in a lot of suites but it's a very nice-to-have.

AVG has put together a very nice internet security suite. The main components, the antivirus and the firewall, are both very effective and all of the other components seem to be working nicely. There is room for some improvement/expansion, as is true with most security suites, but what is here is very polished and clean. AVG is a little pricey when compared to most other suites, but in spite of that cost it is very much worth consideration when looking at computer security suites.

I have been looking for a NON-Adobe product that does more to enhance my photographs than the free program I currently have. This promised great potential, since it is supposed to allow you to layer images, substitute faces, etc.; however, I did not find it lived up to my expectations.

My first clue that this was not the product for me came with its installation. One the one hand, I was impressed that this program came with a CD which I can keep as a back-up, or provided a link to allow me to download a digital version. It also has QR code for users to scan to link them to aps for their Android, iOS and Windows versions for other devices. But then I found out this is an ""all or nothing"" software. I like programs that let me determine what features I want installed on my computer. CyberLink doesn't let you do this. You get everything written onto your hard drive, and you can't disable anything. Not only that, but you get periodical pop-ups that nag you to add this or that for a price.

Like everything else these days, this program wants you to put everything in the Cloud. Not happening! That's a security risk I don't want. My stuff is mine, and I want it to stay that way--particularly creative work. Thankfully, this program gives you the option, but doesn't mandate saving images in the Cloud.

My biggest problem was importing pictures to be able to edit them. In the free version of Picassa (my current photo-editing program), all you do is double-click on a PDF or other image file, and it opens it for viewing (I set it as my default viewer, so it would do this). Then I click a button in the viewing pane that says, ""Edit in Picassa."" Bam! It's there, and I can start playing with it immediately. With PhotoDirector, you have to click File, then Import, and then go through this long rig-a-marrow to bring a photo into the program to edit. With Picassa, once you open a folder and start working on one picture, you can systematically scroll through all the files in that folder and modify them one-by-one. I tried this in PhotoDirector, but never figured out how to make it work.

Making the changes is not as easy or ""intuitive"" as some users made it sound. In most cases, you have to do a lot of clicking, tweaking, checking, etc., to get the enhancement you want. I really hate the crop part, in particular, because it consistently wants to retain the original aspect of the photo, even when you click that you want something else. You can do some fun stuff with people's bodies and faces, but I am not into caricatures as much as correctly representing people. The layering and background modification would be super useful for a graphic artist, but that's not my thing either. If I want to build a great-looking graphic, I find it's a whole lot easier to do it in Publisher.

My biggest beef with this program is how it saves stuff. With Picassa, you get your picture, change it, and then save it directly to the original location. You can either do a simple Control-S or click Save; or to rename and create a new file, do a Save As and put it wherever you please. To delete a file, you just right click and tell the computer to delete it, or drag it to your trash can. With PhotoDirector, it doesn't automatically save a single file to your original folder; you have to tell the program you want it there, and it saves multiple files at once--kind of like when you build an html file. If you want to delete something that has been through PhotoDirect, you have to close the program, or it won't let it go. If you are doing a whole folder of images at once, this gets to be a super time-consuming pain! It also changes the dates on your modified photos, so you don't have a record of when you originally took the picture and then modified it; you just have a set of dates logging the photo as having been created and modified on the day that PhotoDirect had it in its clutches. When you go back some other time to put photos in chronological order to create album pages, as I like to do, this makes your task really hard.

While this program has some cool features for the person with a lot of time on their hands and a truckload of creative energy, it is not for me. I like something quick, simple and direct, that doesn't make me jump through a lot of hoops to get what I want done. I want to control what goes onto my computer, and I don't want a constant barrage of ads to entice me to upgrade to a more expensive package or add features.

We use both word and WP in the office only because we need to communicate with other firms. I give our people  the choice of using word or WP for internal communications. Over the last decade or so most of the employees came to the company knowing only word. A requirement was that they learn enough WP to be proficient in both.

The outcome is that almost every employee scoffed at WP at first and then learned how elegant it is and in the end adopted it as the word processor of choice. My guess is that the output is 150% - 200% of word. Of equal importance is the vastly reduced probability that the word processing software will suddenly get an overwhelming desire to reformat your document, thus trashing hours of work.

My most recent upgrade to X2 was from IX.  I was VERY disappointed in how horribly slow it was to load and to save files.  I was about to give up when I decided to search once more for a fix on the Corel site and I did find the problem.  This is the fix:

  Question

In some cases, if Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or Snapfire Plus was installed or is currently installed on the same computer system as Paint Shop Pro Photo X2, you may experience slow performance when saving files. This behavior may be related to issues with the database files used by all of these programs.
  Answer

The following two sets of instructions may resolve this behavior and allow for proper file saving speed.

Set #1

Do the following to delete the Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Database files. The program will recreate the files upon next launch. First Close Paint Shop Pro Photo X2  if is it running.
1.  Go to Start | Run, Type %temp% and click Ok. (on Vista, click Start button, then highlight Start Search. Type %temp% and then push enter on keyboard)
2.  On the Windows Explorer Tool bar, Click the Up Folder button. The Up Folder button looks like a folder with a green arrow pointing up. If you don't see it, Click View | Go to | Up one level.  (On Vista, click Organize | Layout | Menu bar. Once displayed, go to View | Go to | Up one level).
3.  (on Vista skip to step 4) On XP, Double click on the Application data folder. NOTE: The Application Data folder is a hidden folder. Make sure you have enabled viewing of Hidden files and folders to see this folder.  We have included instructions* below for enabling this view.
4.  Double-click on the Corel folder.
5.  Delete all files and folders in the Corel folder.

* To enable viewing hidden files and folders do the following:
1. Go to Tools | Folder Options.
2. Click on View tab.
3. In the large white area marked Advanced settings, check the ""Show Hidden Files and folders"" radio button.
4. Click OK to accept this setting. You should now see the Application data folder as described above.

Set #2

Do the following to delete the old Paint Shop Pro Photo XI Database files (this is a critical step).
1.  Go to Start | Run, (on Vista, click Start button, then highlight Start Search)
2  Type %appdata% and click Ok (on Vista, push Enter key on keyboard).
3.  Double-click on the Corel folder.
4.  Delete the following files.  If you do not see all of these files, delete all of these files that you do see.
  ImageDB.db
  LastDBFilter. PspCache
  LastDBTreeSel. PspCache
  thumbnails.db
5. . Delete the Paint Shop Pro Photo folder and then close this window.

NOTE: if you receive any prompts about not being able to delete specific files (being used by another program, etc), restart the computer, then try deleting the file again.

Try running Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 again after deleting all files from above procedure. Try saving a file and note if the behavior continues.

If this corrects the behavior, then we recommend no longer running Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or Snapfire Plus on this computer system. Instead we recommend using Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 and Corel MediaOne (this is the updated version of Snapfire Plus).",PSP X2 Was Slow to Load and Save - I found the fix,1256515200,6,

Looking back over my use of  MS Windows products for nearly 30 years, I would never have rated any release higher than ""3."" This is because Microsoft's corporate culture is marketing-driven, not quality-driven. Its products are pushed out the door much too quickly, and many of the security vulnerabilities, bugs, and undesirable ""features"" are never fixed. What's more--customers get whiplash from Microsoft's constantly ripping up the user interfaces to which customers have become accustomed, and replacing them with something far different and non-intuitive.  This costs customers time and frustration, and businesses money in lost productivity. Add to those problems the registry--a cumbersome, unreliable cornerstone of this system, and frustration and loss of productivity are guaranteed. From my perspective, the only reason for using Windows is that its software is ubiquitous--if you want to do application x and want to share it with user y, you tend to be in the Windows trap.

Although Windows 8 is better than some (such as the infamous Vista), it still has bugs. Such as the one that prevents some laptops from completely shutting down and powering off. Even the implementation of several ""fixes""--some by Microsoft, some by others--failed to fix this problem on a Lenovo laptop. Restarts and shutdowns will reach a point where the machine is doing nothing for an extended period, and yet it is still powered on. You must manually power it off, then on again.

I made light usage of video editors over the years, and each time I start using a new product there is quite a bit of a learning curve for me... remembering terms, figuring out the navigation approach, and so on.  That is no different with the PowerDirector product.

Once it clicks that just under the top menus, the Capture/Edit/Produce/Create Disc are the main navigation points, then the rest starts to flow into place.  This is not exactly intuitive given the color schemes on the full screen editor.  One thing I particularly do not like is that if I accidentally click on ""Capture"", I am stuck in a 30 second waiting loop while the system detects devices.  Cyberlink does a good job of providing most of the icons with mouse-over descriptions.  Especially helpful while learning all of the different symbols.

I tested this software with a current project of editing some old silent 8mm family films that were captured to DVD in a horrendous menu.  The biggest challenge with a product like PowerDirector is learning the basics.  I know something can be done, but am not sure the steps to take to do this.  Add the challenge of mental focus as well... while I'm discovering how to export to file or create a menu, I am seeing all these other things that I wonder what they are and then... boom... down another rabbit hole I go.

While I could figure out how to do things, it took some poking and prodding to figure things out.  I would call the user interface nice, but not stunning.  I could find things, but they didn't always leap out at me, or certain functions didn't activate to be visual until clicking on a track and so on.

PowerDirector provides a lot of tools and features very nice feature  I haven't even scratched the surface of.  One feature I was very appreciative of was the fix/enhance feature, under that I used the video stabilize to help smooth out some hand held jittery videos.  I expect over time I will discover more amazing features as needs arrive.

I've got that, and a processor that is above the minimum requirements, along with adequate memory.  I have an expensive film scanner that will not work on Windows 7 or 8, and wanted to use this software on my XP machine.  There are some functions that simply won't work (not disclosed on the box or in the Amazon product description from the company).  The first one I found, when just beginning to check out the software, was that while it will copy online videos, it will not also copy the audio, since it cannot access system audio in Windows XP per the note on screen.

Also, when copying online video, it APPEARS that it only copies for 3 seconds according to a countdown window.  I haven't explored the instructions far enough to figure out what that's about, but recording is actually still going on past the countdown to zero.

Learning curve is steep and requires downloading of the instructions - it's not intuitive.  I'll be transferring this to my Windows 7 computer for at least some further assessment of the program, but that's not where I really wanted to use it.  Normally I would not add an incomplete review, but in this case wanted to at least give what I've got so far.  It's disappointing that the program really is not suitable for XP when it says it is.  I'm very thankful this was provided through Vine, because I think I'd be trying to find a way to return it otherwise.

I've gone through at least 4 other versions and have nothing but praise for the product. It works and works well. Every version adds new features and this version, Creator NXT is no exception.

Usually I upgrade my Roxio software when I upgrade Windows and I need the newer version of Roxio to work with the new versions of Windows. I upgraded this time after going to Windows 8.  This doesn't surprise me as CD/DVD software hooks into the storage code of the operating system to do its thing. Change that code (as in a Windows upgrade) and Roxio needs to be updated. In the past, I only cared about the DVD/CD writing capabilities of Roxio. But after seeing the new software included with NXT, I find I'm really using the new programs. These new programs are Videowave (video editing), Convert (captures and converts videos to different formats), Paintshop Pro (photo editing), and Audio capture and conversion. Most of the time, you access these programs from the Roxio menu screen by selecting what you want to do and the menu launches the program you need to do the task.

Some of the new features that I find the most useful include:

Converting video to the best format to transfer to your tablet, phone, or share online.
Capture videos from websites (like Youtube).
Making slideshows from photos (including adding soundtracks) then converting to video format.
Convert audio formats (great for converting your CDs to MP3s for your iPod/iPhone.

I had the opportunity to grab a copy of Norton 360 and I am very glad I did. Norton 360 is exactly what an anti-virus software needs to be and offers protection in all areas of your computer. Last year I got a Toshiba Satellite that included Windows Vista (which is a pain already) and a trial version of MacAfee, I never understood how to optimize the use of the MacAfee application, it had too many windows and you had to upgrade different things at different times, I was relieved when the trial expired and I got to install a free application called AVG. AVG was good enough for what I needed but suffered from the same thing, 'if you want anti-spy ware you have to download and install this', 'if you want security using the internet install this other thing'...

I uninstalled AVG and installed Norton 360, first of all the installation was quick, it ran for over an hour (as I decided to have it scan my laptop while installing, if you decide not to it may take less time) Once I completed the setup and the application opened I went through the menus in one single screen which is great! The four areas in which the application is divided are in a single screen with submenus when you click over any of them, from this main menu you can scan, setup and even defragment your hard drive (the PC Tune-up feature helps optimize computer performance).  The time it has been installed in my laptop I have not noticed any slowness in performance and it has worked smoothly in the background while I surf the web or work in it.

One feature I liked is the 'Identity protection', in which you setup a profile with your personal info (including credit card number) and it will keep you safe when doing transactions online, you setup a password that Norton360 will require when doing transactions regardless of any security measures the web pages you use have. In my case I access my bank online to do transactions all the time and purchase from web sites, this feature serves as an additional security option. Norton360 also allows me to monitor my network and it even has functionalities that the software that came with my wireless router doesn't have!

Update 10/7/2010 - The first product update was released a couple of weeks ago. The major change fixes the first item below...you can now create custom symbols and store them in the library.  I'm still in the process of evaluating the release and will update this note after I've used it a bit more.

Original Review:
The designers of a package like AutoCAD FreeStyle face a classic challenge: It needs to be easy to use for a novice, with enough features to be useful, yet not so powerful that it will cannibalize sales of the high-end (and much more expensive) AutoCAD systems.  After spending a couple of days using AutoCAD FreeStyle, I think the designers set the bar way too low.  The interface is simple and easy to learn, but far too many features are missing for FreeStyle to be a competitive program.  That's not to say that FreeStyle can't be used to produce usable drawings; it just could be much better if it included basic features that are in other systems.  Let me go through some of the areas that stood out...

Symbol Library - A library is a collection of symbols that are created once and then used on multiple drawings.  FreeStyle comes with a collection of prebuilt symbols that are sufficient to get started, however it's not a complete enough library for a lot of projects - when I attempted to draw my sprinkler system, I discovered that there are no sprinkler components listed.  In most CAD systems, this problem is addressed by allowing the user to build custom symbols.  Once they're added to the library, they can be repeatedly used in future drawings.  This release of FreeStyle doesn't have that capability.  The symbols that come with the program are all that you've got, and that simply isn't enough.  Incidentally, what's in the library is even a little strange... the Electrical Symbols tab includes five Gas and Water symbols along with the basic electrical symbols and the Building Components section only contains six fireplace facades...I'm sure that in real life there are more building components than just those.

Paper Size and Scale - When you start a new drawing, the program asks you to select the size of the paper and the object that you' re going to draw.  e.g. you pick 8.5 x 11"" paper and select that the page represents a 30' x 40' space.  The scale shows that "" equals 1'.  This makes perfect sense to anybody not used to using a CAD program, but is backwards from the norm...normally a designer would select a paper size and a scale.

Splines - Splines are a way of smoothly connecting a series of points.  By adjusting the ""handles"", you can easily draw complex curves.  FreeStyle doesn't have a way of drawing with splines.  The menu allows you to draw with arc segments, straight lines and freehand ""doodles"".  You can adjust the points of inflection on the doodle and eventually get to the desired curve, but it's not as easy as it seems.  True spline capability would be easier.

Radius line joins - When drawing a floor plan, most lines meet with a sharp corner, but that's not always the case.  Sometimes a drawing needs to have a rounded curve joining the two lines.  Most 2-D drafting systems can do that automatically, but FreeStyle lacks that capability.  You can manually accomplish the same thing by drawing a small arc, but why?  You're only talking about a millisecond of computer time to have the program do it for you.

Double lines for walls - Often walls in architectural drawings are shown by two parallel lines, representing the inside and outside surfaces.  Freestyle doesn't have that ability built-in.  To do it correctly, it's a little more complicated that just having a double line as a selectable line type....you need to specify wall thickness, join corners correctly and scale appropriately as the drawing size changes.  Again, all this can be done manually, but the basic idea is to have the program save time by doing the work for you.  Incidentally, the work around is to simply draw a thick solid line for walls...look at all the sample drawings for examples.

Draw a wall of a house.  Now drag a window or door from the symbol library and place it onto the wall.  You'd think that the wall would break and allow the object to be inserted.  It doesn't.  OK, now manually break the wall into two separate line segments and drag the line ends apart to create the necessary break.  That would work, if there was a way to break a line into two pieces, but there isn't.  So you nuke the whole side of the house and redraw two separate line segments on either side of the door.  That works...until you realize that the door is 6"" to the left of where it should be.

The algorithm that calculates color fills is flaky.  When you drag the fill icon over a fillable area, the area is highlighted with a light version of the fill color. It's a nice idea, so you can see exactly where the color's going.  Unfortunately, a single open pixel prevents an area from filling.  The highlighting, though, isn't nearly so discerning.  It's not unusual to have an area highlight, but fail to fill when clicking on the mouse button.  I also managed to fill in an object and then select the color and move it while leaving the outline behind...it was a little strange.

There's no instruction manual.  You can get help for any of the commands by selecting that command and clicking the question mark icon.  Clicking on the icon showing three stacked baby letter blocks takes you to the Freestyle website where there is more detailed information.  It's annoying, though, not to have something you can skim through.  I was trying to figure out how to color in a tree and it wasn't until I saw a picture in the on-line help that I realized that the color was coming from a filled in circle located behind the tree.

I could add more, but you get the idea.  If the product manager at AutoDesk chooses, all of these can (and should) be fixed in a future release.  Until then, though, I'm only giving FreeStyle two stars.  The simple user interface is right on the mark for a non-technical consumer level product.  The omitted features, though, cost it dearly in the ability to produce usable and functional drawings.",Not quite ready for prime time...and now it never will be,1277337600,47,

I travel a lot for speaking (driving myself), and my GPS maps are out of date. This promised the possibility of being able to add files to the GPS, plus some other features that looked promising. However, as I've played around with it, I'm a little disappointed with the results. I'll start with the positives though. I should note, this is a new install, not an upgrade from a previous version.

What I liked: I installed this on my Windows 7 computer without hitches.  This software communicates with the internet to give up to date reports of construction. This is something that most online free programs and normal GPS don't do. It's easy to customize a route, add stops, drag the route to a different road and set up a whole itinerary. The database recognized most locations by description and filled in the address, which was helpful. I liked the ability to calculate gas cost based on the MPG of my vehicle and the average cost of gas. A big benefit is the ability to plan a trip and come back to the file to make changes as the planning continues. Using a free online program doesn't carry this benefit. Also, it works on a laptop when you don't have Wifi, since it's installed on the computer. Big bonus if you're in the car trying to modify your route and you have your computer along.

What I didn't like: While the product does not promise to work with all GPS, it didn't work with my Garmin. I have the ability to add GPX files, but they wouldn't open on the machine. The program did not recognize my Garmin when it was plugged in, and the manually transferred files didn't work. Also, the software has a button to click to transfer the map to a cell phone. This didn't work for me either, since I'd have to have Microsoft Outlook for this to work. Seems that if I'm running and Microsoft computer with the latest Windows and Windows Live Mail, this ought to work. But it's set up to work only with the cadillac of e-mail programs. When I tried printing, sometimes just the map would print. There wasn't an option that I could find to fix this. When I hit print, it just went to the printer with no in between step where I could choose settings. Some landmarks that I would expect to be in the maps aren't. For example, I searched for a county park near me and the name of the park, nor the lake showed anything.

All in all, I don't think I'd purchase this in the future. Although it has some good features, I can get most of what I got from it on Google maps or Mapquest for free. If the uploading to my GPS and the sending to my cell phone would work, I'd reconsider my opinion of the program. I guess I just expected a little more from it.","Okay, but lacking universal application",1339545600,,

However, AutoCAD is a beefy program and is not something you can just hop into and get some small projects done. I would recommend this if you are going to be doing some heavy work with it, and not for a hobby unless you are really into making technical drawings and designs.

So, I am more of a technical guy and like programs that don't try to turn everything into some happy friendly wizard. So, I found parts of AutoCAD LT 2011 to be very awesome because they were right there for you to use, but not in the way or annoying. However, I kind of found the awkward MS Office-like menu at the top to be a bit odd. I am not really fond of that style yet, and kind of prefer the old fashioned less ""friendly"" raw menu systems. However, it appears that AutoCAD is going to push this new system through, so even though you should be able to go back to the old style, it gives me the feeling that you better get used to it now because future versions will only feature this cheesy new ""ribbon"" menu system. I would prefer the traditional menu structure be always available, and the default.

The software itself is very in-depth. If you are professionally drawing out plans, then this will be a very useful tool. If you are familiar with AutoCAD software, then you should be able to use it without much more than some annoying menu changes that you will have to get used to. If you are new to this software, or have only used alternative programs, you will likely want to pick up a book and look for some tutorials online.

I found it just right.
When I contemplated self-employment, I had several concerns, including whether or not I could actually keep the wolf from the door that way, but my largest was the thought that I would have to keep records of some kind. I don't have a talent for that. When my sixth client sent me a contract, I searched diligently for a book called, say, ""The Smallest Amount of Accounting Knowledge You Need to Avoid Getting Thrown in Jail,"" but didn't find such a thing. All the books I could find seemed to imagine that I was -- well, an accountant.

You know what I mean about bossy software. It reminds you to apply payments to invoices and nags you about putting in people's names correctly and won't let you charge people for ""June.""
In general, I don't like bossy software. Bossy word processing programs often just don't understand complex syntax and don't have as large a vocabulary as I do, and I really don't need my computer to warn me that I haven't been properly introduced to websites.
But the bossiness of this software means that someone like me can put her data in correctly enough to send it off to the accountant -- and there is a system for doing that, too.

So, if you were satisfied with the performance of the 2013 version of this security suite, nothing about this version should cause any concern (...well, other than installing it which we'll get to in a moment). If the interest is a first time install or a revisit to the Norton family, I am going to reiterate much of last year's review, because for the typical home user, I still believe this security alternative is among the most comprehensive and easiest to use packages presently available whether the need is for one PC or multiples.

However, as far as installation is concerned, there is unquestionably room for improvement. With the de-emphasis of internal optical drives, many software developers are moving toward downloadable products. Norton 360 still has a physical CD available but the recommended option is download from the Norton site, so naturally my choice is to install from the CD which is supposed to upgrade the existing version...yeah, right or more accurately.. yeah, but not without encumbrances like a conflict between two versions that is not resolvable without a hard restart. My suggestion would be to delete the old version and do a fresh install if the decision is to go with CD install. It might mean loss of histories, existing network mapping and resetting preferences but it might also be less of a headache than trying to transfer them via the supposed upgrade capability. From my second PC, I did go the online route and it worked without incident.

That said, and feeding into my unabashedly admitted laziness, the following is an excerpt from last year's review, and as I am a fan of the 360 product, probably a preview of my review of next year's version:

Norton 360 is a comprehensive security suite with an array of processes and tasks consolidated in a single application. The complement of features can be found in the manufacturer's description above. Each of the features could be addressed through other resources and admittedly, a few of them might well be more effectively administered by standalone apps, but for the user who wants to set it and forget it, this product is among the top choices.

For less knowledgeable users, who may desire to find out more about security protocols and firewall settings, there are support functions here that can assist and increase awareness of threats they may not have even known they could monitor, of particular interest if surfing curiosity takes the user to a wide range of unknown sites.  I know with dynamic IP assignment, 360 is a fast and convenient way to identify physical addresses for all of the devices I have on my network with logging on the router.  Backup to external drives or online to the Norton storage site is also supported. In fact, the only difference between the standard and Premium additions of this suite is the amount of basic online storage available, with the standard addition providing 2GB and the Premium 25GB. Users, however, with multi-device platforms including Macs and mobile devices would be better served by purchasing the Multi-device version of this software.

I am rather obsessive about running registry cleanup and 360 offers another utility to supplement the shareware app I use most regularly. I do so because I do think any one product successfully identifies all files that could be cleaned. Similarly, Startup manager is another utility that can be assessed elsewhere but is another convenience found in this product and scanning performance can be improved by adjustments available with Norton Insight.","Um, Whatever I said last year.",1383436800,6,

Maybe the larger and much more expensive PhotoShop programs do a little more, maybe they are a little easier to use, or maybe the Nay Sayers just hate Canadians.  How would I know?  I don't even own anything from PhotoShop except Elements 7.

I started editing photos using Picasa, the free download from Google.  That was okay then - for my level of expertise.  Later, I improved my results a little by using PhotoShop Elements 7.  It was a lot more difficult to use than Picasa, but the results were worth the extra effort.  Both accepted Canon RAW formats.

Now I'm using Coral Paint Shop Pro Ultimate Photo X2 - and the other smaller programs included for free.  I am amazed that good User Guides, and excellent Video Instructions, are included at no additional charge.  I did purchase a book for Coral's Photo X3, but just to see if it's worth the upgrade to me.  It is.  I'm saving up (or waiting for the price to drop when X4 comes out).

Of course all these new potentials are kind of overwhelming at first.  But I can use just the easy parts or, if inspired by a one of my pictures, I can go to whatever level I'm willing to expend the effort to use.

5495,5495,4.0,False,"07 20, 2011",A1CVFUQ1PGSIJL,B004Y8MKZM,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},T. Adlam,"Since I've been a user of Kaspersky Anti-Virus (KAV) for over five years, I wanted to try out Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) to see if it truly warranted making a switch.

I installed KIS on an older Vista laptop, a netbook with Windows 7 Starter, and a newer HP with 64 bit Windows. Installation across each of the machines was painless. For installing on the netbook, since it doesn't have a CD/DVD drive, I just downloaded the software package from the Kaspersky website, which actually saved some time since it was the latest version and there was no need for the software to update during the installation process. Once installed, I simply used the key on the CD to register my license.

(Tip: During the installation, one of the steps will ask for your email address; it's not made clear this isn't required information. Unless you *want* Kaspersky to email you about products and such, you can move to the next phase without hampering the installation.)

At first blush it's exactly like KAV, except it has a few other management panels. That's when I double-checked the box to see exactly *what* the differences were from KAV, if any.

First up was the spam filter. No one really needs anymore manhood enhancement emails, so superifically this is a great feature to have. However, I primarily use Gmail which has a superb spam filter, and Thunderbird, which doesn't seem to integrate well with Kaspersky's spam feature (or, at least, I haven't been able to figure it out). This might be a different story for someone using Outlook, but so far, this feature wasn't enough to tip the scales.

Next was the Safe Desktop which lets you open suspicious files safely. Frankly, I wasn't about to test this feature on my production computers, so I used it on the older Vista machine. After inspecting the feature, I've come to think of it more as a novelty for the morbidly curious or the overly paranoid. I say that because Kaspersky already does a good job of alerting you if it believes something is infected of acting suspiciously. At that point, a user generally chooses to quarantine or delete the offending file. Why would someone want to open it? Unless the file was downloaded from a trusted website, there really isn't a good reason I could think of. But, again, that's a personal opinion, and this feature also wasn't enough to warrant an upgrade.

I then tried the Safe Search feature, and it does, indeed, do as it states--it alerts you whenever you land on a suspicious website. I tried it on a few known websites which disseminate viruses and other trojans and each time I received a Kaspersky notice. This is especially good for people who enjoy surfing the net, but who may not necessarily understand the perils of doing so freely. The downside is that some websites may load more slowly than usual because of *how* this feature works (it pings the Kaspersky server to make sure the site being visited is safe). As someone who does tend to play it safe while cruising the internet and about the files she downloads, I'm not swayed by this feature, however, I *can* see the utility.

Application Control is another of those features that looks better on paper, at least from my perspective. Chances are, Kaspersky would have warned you long before you even tried to install an application that it was suspicious or infected with a virus. So, again, I wonder if this feature is simply for the overly paranoid.

The redeeming feature, in my opinion, is the included parental controls which limits access to the internet. Some browsers already come with parental controls, however, those can generally be circumvented by simply using a different browser. With Kaspersky, that won't work. Access to the internet, period, is restricted. This is good not only for parents, but also people who need to restrict access to their computers, for instance is settings where one may have a roommate or colleague.

Although I may not find anything compelling to upgrade, that is not enough for me to mark off for this product. Overall, it performs as well as KAV, and I can definitely see the usefulness in the Safe Search and Parental Control features for those who need them.

That said, I do find that it has a tendency (as does KAV) to slow down my older machine and sometimes my Netbook when it's running, even in the background. Also, the virtual keyboard is quirky as it is with KAV. For those reasons, I had to knock a star off.",Debating the Upgrade from KAV 2011...,1311120000,,

If you had a boatload of money you could buy their entire suite of programs (I think there are 19 of them) in what they called the ""Creative Suite,"" better known as ""CS."" The version of CS you have is tacked onto the end, so if you have version 5, you would say ""I have CS5."" Owning the licensed software to use forever is now becoming obsolete.

Now they have developed a subscription service to their software that you pay for on a month-to-month, or year-to-year basis.  You can access it from any computer by logging in to your account. Everything is stored ""in the cloud"" so they dubbed it the ""Creative Cloud"" rather than the Creative Suite. You may pick and choose which of their programs you want to subscribe to, but each will cost you something, and as with all Adobe products, it ain't cheap!

Subscriptions start at $10 a month for one program (like Photoshop) and from there, it goes up, and up and up. To subscribe to their entire Suite of products will run you $40 to $50 per month. In a year's time, you will have paid about what it used to cost to own the entire Creative Suite.
Once that year is up, you have to renew your subscription if you still want to access those programs, and they make you agree to ""auto-renewal"" once you subscribe! Oh, they assure you that they won't charge your card without letting you know first, but the bottom line is that they can auto-renew you on a month to month basis.
Advantages with a subscription: you don't have to have a ton of memory cleared on your PC to run and use their programs. You will always be using the most up-to-date version of their software, and you can access your work from anywhere that you can log in to your account.
The disadvantage is that you now have to continue to pay year after year for use of their programs. It's not clear what happens to any of the work you have stored in their cloud once you let your subscription lapse.

Now, Adobe has always made very sophisticated and powerful software, and is still considered the standard for professional photographers, publishers, and the like. Other brands have attempted to match the Adobe quality, and Microsoft Word is now close to matching it, but Adobe is still considered the industry standard for the most part.

Personally, I have never found Adobe software to be user-friendly at all. It is not intuitive to the casual user, especially if you are used to the ""drop and drag"" features of Windows. The learning curve for Adobe software is steep. I spent a couple days in a class just to learn how to use ONE of their programs called ""publisher."" Once I was no longer immersed in the classroom, I found it difficult to remember how to use the software at home.
I had a hard time figuring out how to redeem the ""card"" I bought to use one of the software pieces on their site, and I use computers everyday at home and work.  When I go to a website to redeem a gift card, I expect to see a button somewhere that says ""redeem"", but no, that would be too easy for Adobe. First you have to create an account and log in, THEN you can redeem your card to pay for the product. Meanwhile Adobe assumes you must want to upgrade or renew a current subscription. Very confusing! I'm used to creating the account AFTER I have found the place to redeem my card.  Adobe makes every opportunity available for you to spend more money on their stuff, almost to where it is pushy. After I subscribed to Ps and Lr, I logged in and couldn't find my subscriptions. I clicked on a video tutorial on their site that linked to a YouTube video, which promptly locked up my computer before I could watch it. I don't normally have any problems with YouTube videos, so I don't know who is at fault there.

If you do professional photography or publishing, you are probably already familiar with Adobe software, and therefore a subscription adds a level of convenience. But it will cost you more now over the long run.

Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less.  I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC.  I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work.  We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want without any extra fees, there is no limit on printing or mailing returns using the Post Office.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 Update: State returns are now available.
Original comment: For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Please check back in mid January 2015"".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return.  The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they are aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment. Hopefully there will be an update when the problem is fixed.

 The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

However - for Vermont, where there is a property tax ""prebate"" that residents must know to apply for...TaxCut does not have the forms one needs AND they do not tell you you need the forms.  SO - I would never  get the $550 ""prebate"" that I was entitled to this year, except that I knew about it from previous tax filings.
Also, it bothers me that in order to get my ""prebate"" I had to fill out downloaded forms by hand after searching for needed information in my files and using a calculator to get some needed totals.  To me, this is NOT what I should have to do after spending over $65 for a Fed./State/e-filing program!!!
Besides, if Turbo Tax can fill out these forms automatically and have these same forms in its State of Vermont Tax Program - what is wrong with TaxCut doing the same thing???  (I chatted online with TaxCut's customer support about this problem and they told me (a week ago) that there would be no updates to their Vermont program and that they ""do not include all needed forms"" in their program.)
NOW, wouldn't you think it is important to know about and be able to file forms HS-122 and HS-144 when you might get $500 or more back for submitting them?
What does this say about TaxCut and their completeness of tax preparation software?
What does this say about TaxCut's concern for their customers????

He loves drawing and sharing his drawings which, lately, have been cartoon character sketches.  When I saw that Anime Studio Pro 8 had the ability to take sketches made on paper and turn them into easy-to-manipulate animations, I knew that I had to give it a shot.

Now, understand that I am a complete novice when it comes to computer animation.  I didn't know what to expect from this, and I was nervous that it might be difficult getting started.  However, SmithMicro provides a great getting-started tutorial that quickly introduced me to most of its main features.  After about an hour with this tutorial (which did NOT include animating paper sketches), I felt like I had the confidence to try to scan in and animate one of my son's sketches.

Success! Thanks to the tutorial's section on using a ""bone layer"" to to manipulate a sketch, it only take me about 15 minutes to scan a drawing, add some bones, manipulate those bones along a timeline, and export the animation to a Quicktime file (many other export options exist).  I showed my son, and now he wants to learn to do some of this on his own!

I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of what this software can do.  However, SmithMicro's website has many tutorials available (some are pdfs, and others are online videos).

The Ancestry website (which you get 3 months of access to with the software) contains a vast amount of information.  It was fascinating to comb through their records and see census data going back to the 1800s and also seeing the WWI draft papers of my great-grandfathers.  As you enter new family members into the tree, Ancestry looks up information and provides hints and facts for each family member.  Having access to this wealth of information is great and I would give Ancestry 5 stars for the information.  (One note about the information - it seems to mostly be United States records.  I found no information from my ancestors' homelands - mostly Germany and Russia.  I can't speak to whether Ancestry has access to records from other countries though.)

The data an essential part of this program - at least for me since my family did not keep meticulous records of our ancestors.  Without the data, I would have a tiny tree, only going back as far as my great-grandparents.  However, the software that creates the tree is not very user friendly or intuitive.  I found myself getting lost in the tree when going back and forth between the research function and the data entry function.  The software also wasn't intuitive enough on its own to figure out siblings and parents based on the census data.  All of the information would be listed - parents and children, but importing this information often takes several counter-intuitive steps.  Also, I did the DNA ancestry test and although I was able to import it into my family tree, it didn't integrate well.  It's just a fact attached to a family member and can't even easily be seen unless I dig into that person's record.

I was also dismayed that I had to enter credit card information even though this software came with a free trial.  It is set to automatically renew and I will have to remember to cancel it on my own, which is very irritating.  I hate when companies use this sort of marketing tactic.  It really turns me off.

I've had problems with other security programs in the past (Microsoft, Norton and McAfee), but this has been the most trouble-free package for me by far.  Installation was simple and quick, registration went off without a hitch and my system performance is clearly better.

And what about the System Vault?  Consider it your last-ditch defense.  If someone manages to walk off with your notebook, System Vault won't let them into the files that you least want shared.  'Nuff said.

-- PowerDVD remote apps, or at least the one available for Android can't find the main PowerDVD I installed on my laptop (Windows 7, 64-bit)
-- PowerDVD mobile apps, or at least the one available for Android can't find the main PowerDVD I installed on my laptop (Windows 7, 64-bit)

- Any of the gee-whiz features such as:
-- the ability to render normal video as 3D video
-- super-high resolution support that's not likely to be available on a monitor connected to my laptop in the foreseeable future

MY EXPERIENCE

The software was easy to install and it installed relatively quickly. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to keep it on the computer where the initial installation took place so I tried to install while offline. After I entered the key, the program told me that it was fine that I will be able to use it without online validation for 30 days (nice). Sadly, as soon as I started the program while online, the program 'validated' itself so I can't move it elsewhere unless I talk to 'customer support', or so the customer support person told me.

Speaking of which, getting tech support does not seem to be that easy. I couldn't get that far through the site's Byzantine menu trees but it appears that any support beyond the most basic topics (installation or, in my case, transfer to another PC) requires the customer to pay some more if a human technician is needed. The alternative is exploring that 'free' FAQ sections which, in my case, didn't have the information I was seeking and appears to be too generic to be worth much.

Once installed - and I am happy to report that no spyware or carpware was forced upon my laptop - the program ran well, it never crashed while playing a disc or a file and was responsive to controls for the features that actually worked (see my notes above concerning the 'remote' and 'mobile' apps.

Playing movies is the main and in most cases the only reason one would buy PowerDVD and it plays movies and home videos well. The program supports about a million file formats and adds some nice features that can enhance the viewing experience:

- there is a set of 'TrueTheater' controls concerning the video and audio quality meant to improve the quality of non-HD content
- it's easy to zoom if you prefer to have more of your screen to be filled
- there is volume control
- has a 3D button that will instantly turn any movie into something you can watch with 3D glasses (a gimmick you'll get tired of after 30 seconds but it's there nevertheless)
- ability to set languages, subtitles and bookmarks

Overall, movie and video playing is near-flawless if the app can actually get to the source.

PowerDVD will play anything off:

- your computer's integrated optical drive, whether it's a DVD or a Blu-ray drive
- an external optical drive
- your computer internal HDD or any external HDD
- a network drive that your computer connects to
- a DLNA server if it can find it

Of course, bandwidth can become an issue when accessing remote sources. I had no issues playing DVD-quality movies off a DLNA server accessed over Wi-Fi or Blu-ray quality media off an external USB 3.0 HDD. Worth to note that it sometimes required a rescan to discover some of my DLNA servers and at least one of them (our PS3) was never detected even though other apps do see it.

Attempting to use PowerDVD for anything other than 'video' was part of my experience but I quickly realized that, as much as the developers tried to expand into other types of media, this version of their product did not persuade me to take advantage of those features, not when it's so easy to get to YouTube from a browser window and there are superior interfaces for photo viewing and organizing.

MY RATING

PowerDVD gets high marks for its ability to play movies and videos and play them well from practically any source and in almost any known format. Some of the 'frills', especially its ability to interact with the 'remote' and 'mobile' Android apps did not work for me but mine could be a special case. Sadly, I will probably never know because getting the PowerDVD 'mobile' or 'remote' to run was not worth paying CyberLink's tech support for actually supporting their app.

I am not likely to ever use PowerDVD to play or organize or interact in any way with the 'other' types of media because there are vastly better alternatives out there. I wish I could say that it was 'nice' that PowerDVD supports 'photos' and allows me to watch YouTube but the truth is that I don't care and I never will.

I didn't like and I don't appreciate CyberLink's customer support scheme. Once users pay for the product (and, yes, the license does state that the product is never 'yours' and the money you gave them only grants you the privilege to access and use CyberLync's property at their discretion) they should expect some decent level of support without being asked to pay more. Support should be about dealing with the product issues and shortcomings, not running a customer nickel and diming profit center.

These being said, my rating subtracts 1 star for disappointing 'support' and another 0.5 star for the unneeded features that add bulk to the software and unnecessarily complicate the program's controls and menu trees. Another 0.25 star is subtracted for the not so flawless DLNA support and for the Android apps not working, coming down to  the grand total of 3.25 stars, fairly rounded down to 3.",Movies and video player,1373155200,40,

It has plenty of features and bells and whistles, which most novice and even medium-level movie makers may not need or even want to take advantage of. I only say this because Cyberlink Power Director 13 has several different versions, and customers should research which features they may need for their own level of expertise.

This version, Ultimate, comes with 10GB of cloud storage, as does their Ultra version, which is considerably less expensive. Ultimate, like the Ultimate Suite, does include Premium Effects and Templates, which are not available in the less-expensive, Ultra version (the premium effects do include a wedding template package as well as a vacation video template package).

Any of these PowerDirector 13 versions is going to give you an outstanding tool for transforming your videos with titles and special effects. However, if you are not familiar with this product, be prepared for a learning curve and give yourself adequate time to learn how to use it to its full advantage. All of their versions provide great support for automatic uploading to YouTube, Facebook, and other on-line video sharing sites, as well as support for creating your own DVDs, including Blu-ray and the new 4K Ultra HD.

Cyberlink does offer a free trial download of PowerDirector 13 on their website which does not have all the features of Ultra, Ultimate, or Ultimate Suite, but will give you a chance to experience the core product before buying.

I started using it when it was an independent company and gave up on it when it was acquired by Avid, who (in my opinion) practically destroyed the application and provided simply awful customer support. Like many others, I abandoned Pinnacle. It was bought by Corel and I didn't have high hopes for it.

 Much to my surprise, Corel after years of flailing is making a concerted effort to rejuvenate their acquired product lines. PaintShop Pro which was on a downhill path is really a great program in its present iteration. I skipped sever iterations of Pinnacle Studio, but when offered the opportunity to evaluate Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate, I figured why not.

 Overall I think Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate is vastly improved since my past outing with the product. But I will be sticking with Cyberlink Director.

 The feature list is on the Amazon web page, but I suggest you also look at the Pinnacle Systems website as well. Pinnacle does not offer a trial download of Pinnacle Studio 19, but the manual is available. If you're a Cyberlink Director or Adobe Premiere Elements user considering a switch, I recommend downloading and perusing the manual before purchase.

 Ultimately it comes down to a users preferences. This is probably not a program for absolute beginners, but like Cyberlink Director and Adobe Premiere Elements, it is a good place to continue after using Windows MovieMaker.

 It installs easily, interfaces are a bit cluttered  which can be said of all its competitors as well  and has some features like 4K that few people will use right now. The New Blue Effects package is nice.

 In toto, Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate is a nice serviceable video editing suite. With all the choices in the market, though, I would advise careful consideration.

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.

An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.

Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.

It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.","Annual expense, but some neat benefits",1381190400,,

The traditional size is not made any more, which is bad enough, but to find that these new Hallmark cards do not even have the Hallmark logo embedded on the back flap of the envelope was a disappointment.  This makes it so there is no compelling reason to buy the Hallmark card stock rather than card stock made by your printer manufacturer.  Supposedly, papers made by the printer manufacturer are made to work specifically with that brand ink so why bother to buy the Hallmark paper?  I did notice that the cards seem to go through the HP printer easier with fewer roller marks.  To me though, this is just a matter of two negatives cancelling each other out.  One, the Hallmark paper feels to me to be a bit thinner and the second negative is that HP printer design would leave any roller marks at all on photo card paper made by HP.

This is a serious deficiency in this software's ability to protect your computer. I'll get a comment back from Norton, but until I do, I'm deducting a star and noting that Norton 360 is not complete protection against malware.

I'm required to use Norton on my home PC in order to access my work PC at home if I want to view it remotely. That's how our IT support has arranged things.  So even if I might prefer a different brand of anti-virus, this is the one I use.

INSTALLATION AND SUPPORT

Norton installs easily. That's huge. I am not a PC guru though I do know how to do basic tasks. And I have to make sure any PC I use at home is updated and kept free of the mounting threat for viruses and malware, which are programs that enter your computer from a website and gather data or otherwise intend to harm you in some way. The fact I could get this installed in minutes, and that it has a 3 PC license made it a big selling point for me. Most of us have at least two in the house and a laptop, so 3 is a logical number of licenses in a package.

However, there have been reports that this software will not install well on older PC's. Mine are about 4 years old, and both use either Vista or Win 7, so I am in fairly good shape. But many many people have older PC's that run well and that they have not upgraded. There are reports that this software is not well-adapted to older systems, and may crash your system.  I got away with it on my PC, but if you are running anything less than a 3 year old PC, I'd suggest you not mess with this unless you have some PC knowledge. (Trend Micro seems to be more forgiving of older PC's at least, in our hands.) So I bring it up, because even if I have a good result, YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY--that is, this may not be the software you want.

The improvements I noticed most is a backup option that helped me do a more regular backup task, something I had been lax about.

Another improvement is PC Cleanup, which lets you remove unused files from the registry. I do NOT hack the registry. I'm just out of date when it comes to Win 7 or Vista and the registry. I used to be able to handle deeper tasks years ago with XP but I just don't have time or bandwidth to become that knowledgeable about the operating system anymore. But if you install trial software, or have a software package you don't use anymore, it's advisable to remove it from the system and haha, the ""remove software"" feature of Windows doesn't remove everything left behind.

GOTCHAS

No Norton Anti-Bot included in this package, which is software that protects against ""bot""Trojan programs. This is amazingly bad. You have to buy Norton Anti-Bot, a standalone application, separately and how many people know that they should do this, or feel good about ponying up another thirty quatloos to get important protection. A ""bot"" is a Trojan that is a kind of malware that installs itself and can open a door to virus or data mining from your computer. The older ""Trojans"" tricked you into installing them (you'd download, say, a cute game or screensaver and it would be a ""Trojan horse"" containing a harmful program inside. That's why you scan software that you intend to install.) In this case, the Trojan comes in as malware installed by a website automatically, and the Anti-Bot detects it. If you surf the web to sites you are not familiar with, or if you have other users (psst ...your children) you should have this.  ***** UPDATE ***** Seems I am out of date--AntiBot has been replaced by protection that is included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Internet-Security-software/dp/B005GI19HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Internet Security software.</a>

Installation on older PCs: Reported to be not as good on older PCs. (I was ok.)

Spyware: if you search out the test reports, Norton is great on virus, in fact, it is at the top, but it is only middling good for spyware and misses many issues. For the average user who is not so savvy on spyware, this may not seem so important, but there are many malicious websites you can stumble on these days, even clicking once onto them and you will get something undesirable installed onto your PC. If Spyware is a concern, you may turn to other packages instead. You can add Ad-Aware Pro which is well-rated. I found Trend Micro better than Norton on warning me about potentially malicious sites; one site that passed through Norton was stopped by Trend Micro, but Trend Micro is said not to be as good for virus trapping as Norton.

Support: The online support, where you use the internet to access help files, requires that you enter personal information to access the database. Huh? Since most help moved to online format (with good reason; it's easier to maintain, keeps versions of software updated) almost all software packages you use let you simply go online and search the database for the help you need. Here, you have to log in and give your name. I think after you paid for and installed a licensed legitimate package, that should be freely accessible. Furthermore, unless your help is dealing with a ""known issue"", you will have to pay for telephone support for settings for your particular PC or firewall. Sometimes, the online help fails, especially during the initial install. If you cannot navigate and solve your own issue, you will have to pony up more cash to solve an installation. A workaround for many companies is a users forum and for example, I installed Magix MX and needed a setting to add a feature and the user forum NOT the database had the answer for me. Here, you are forced to call them if you cannot find your particular answer.

The tech support is about the cost of the software for one session, so if you are budget-minded and in trouble, you'll have to do an exhaustive internet search to save the dough. I realize that live technical support is an expensive burden to a software manufacturer, but I'd have preferred to see one call included for installation issues and let customers pay for additional support after installation, which seems fairer to me.

SUMMARY

Overall, a good package. Who should buy this? The average PC user, with a NEWER PC and intermediate knowledge of PC's  a good candidate for this software. Be prepared to pony up for tech help if you need firewall help. If you are a basic PC user, I would suggest hiring a tech to help you through the installation and checking your home system, including wireless for security. While this will cost you, the cost of a breach in your PC security could lead to identity theft and other problems that would cost much more.  Beware of some of the issues, such as older PC installation.","Good virus protection, some IMPORTANT gotcha's",1334966400,38,

I agree with other reviewers that this version is not enough of an upgrade to make it worthwhile to purchase if you already have Fusion 4. However, if you don't already have the software then this is not only a very worthwhile purchase, but essential in the business world.

Fusion 5 works great, but compared to version 4, there are not enough new features to warrant purchasing a new software package. But the improved graphics speed is a reason to upgrade if that is important to you. With Fusion 5, you get the best of both Mac and Windows applications - wonderful product.

It has many more features and included add-ins than I'll ever need. For example - multi-camera features are cool but I doubt I'll ever use more than 2 cameras. Still it's nice to have the option. The same for a lot of the other advanced capabilities. Motion follow is already a very useful for me.

The program comes with a limited time access to on-line training. I have only dipped my figurative toe into these lessons but I think most new video editors will find the training a very helpful quick start and introduction to video editing using Pinnacle Studio. I think this is a thoughtful plus, but the time-limited access is just plain strange. Happily there are lots of helpful youtube videos too.

Somehow it bugs me when a program has a shopping cart built-in. It's like you are expected to get add-ons to really use the program. For example, a major feature is 4K and HD editing. Does it make sense that Blu-Ray burning should be an extra cost $7.99 add-on you can only purchase through the program? Probably this does not push other folks buttons like it does mine.

Here is what I like:
+ Easy to use interface (coming from Adobe Premiere)
+ Limited-time access to online training is useful
+ Performs well with reasonably quick user interface
+ Reads/writes every format I could want
+ Motion follow for text has been very handy!
+ A large number of transitions and effects are included
+ Tracking effects (like blur and following text) are helpful

Here is what I don't so much:
- Blu-Ray burning requires a $7.99 add-in

I like when software gets regular updates. I installed the latest patch today:  V20.1.0 released 2016-10-26. Here is a summary  of its changes:
* Resolved black or flickering preview
* NewBlueFX: Watermarks removed
* Resolved error messages that displayed when editing titles
* Resolved crashes in Slideshow projects
* Sample project is now removable
* New! Added audio-specific fade transition (Audio Cross Fade)

In conclusion, I think Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate is a very nice video editing package at an affordable price point. It is feature rich with a very usable interface. It seems intuitive to me after using Adobe Premiere. Performance seems pretty good to me on my desktop with lots of RAM. It bugs me that an add-on is required to burn a Blu-ray and the program has a built-in shopping cart.

The annoyances are minor compared to the overall value of the program. Amazon does not give half stars and I don't think that I can really take a full star off so 5 stars is my rating.

Hope this helps someone.","Good User Interface, Blu-Ray Support Is Extra, Includes Training, Be Sure To Update!",1477612800,,

And even did the same thing but with better effects with the Video Toaster. By the file I could even think of affording a Video Toaster Flyer, I already went PC and then waited for affordable editing to come for it. I started with Pinnacle Studio and eventually moved on to Adobe but Corel Video Studio has been a very interesting alternative.

I use a Core i7 5th generation tower PC to capture video from VHS / 8MM tape and I do most of my editing on a Surface Book Core i7, 6th generation. But rest assured, I also use a lot of today's modern digital video from phones to cameras.

Corel VideoStudio installs like a champ and is up and ready to go in no time. Surprisingly, I find it's interface much easier to use than Adobe Premiere Elements as it is more straight forward. I was up, running and editing in no time.

One of my favorite features is Instant Movies and FastFlick. These days, I want to slap together a quick video for fast sharing and this is a great feature. Not as convenient as the ""Assistant"" on Google Photos but does the same and better job.

I still have a lot of clients/friends/family who still want DVD""s and I am finding I like Core's DVD creator quite a bit. It is easy and straight forward to use and I was able to create very good looking DVD's with little effort.

If I have to take a few marks away from it it is that it crashes needlessly often on my machine. No specific point and it is kind of a time bomb, which makes me almost scared to use it. So, suffice to say, I save and save often.

This software will do it, but it takes a lot of time to figure out 'how'.

This would be the negative to this software for the novice to intermediate user.  A tough learning curve that requires weeks, if not months of learning before you feel comfortable using it.  Some would argue that this is the case with most high-end software whether it relates to animation or not.  I would tend to agree, but it can be a con for some.

The positives to this software are many.  It can be used by PC or MAC users, offers the ability to bring your drawings to life, automatically lip-syncs your audio to the drawings, and allows you to import Photoshop files.

The Character Wizard is perhaps the easiest way to get started using the Anime Studio Pro 8 software, as you'll see results quickly and with the least amount of frustration.  Experts won't care about it, but if you're buying this to have fun with your computer and/or kids, start with with wizard!

The software is feature-rich with tweaks to color schemes, brush sizes, and layers (similar to Photoshop) which was expected.  What wasn't expected was the ability to do 3D renderings to share on YouTube.  Pretty cool stuff!  The ability to upload your creations to Facebook and YouTube is a fun perk.

Advanced users will love the ability to script their own tools and add-ons for the program, but frankly, this user will never get to that point!

All the major video formats are supported, with output up to 1080p and even in 3D.

Made for professional digital artists and animation professionals, Anime Studio 8 is loaded with amazing features and delivers what it promises on that front.

If you do not fall into that category of user, you may find it overwhelmingly hard to learn anything but the basics through the wizard.  You can learn more than that on your own, but it takes time in the form of a lot of reading and hands-on trial and error.  If you're brave enough to give it a try, and can commit to learning it, you'll be rewarded.","Great software, tough learning curve",1337472000,,

I set it up with Architecture settings because that is what I am most interested in, as someone who has been involved in restoring and renovating a hundred year old farmhouse-- forever.  I had been playing around with the program in terms of design but without really scratching the surface of what this program could do.  I put additions on our house and took them off.  I made plans for our yard.  I also designed a few things of furniture, which are best to never be made and certainly not sat on.

It was fun.  I knew that there were more than half of the tricks in this that I wasn't even aware of, let alone figured out how to use.

Once I had a book called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-and-Running-with-AutoCAD-2011-2D-and-3D-Drawing-and-Modeling/dp/0123757177/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up and Running with AutoCAD 2011: 2D and 3D Drawing and Modeling</a>, this all changed.  This book clarified the program, teaching the user everything from the beginning.  Like many programs, you have to know what you want to ask it to do in order for it to work.  And in order to be able to use it, you need to do a lot of practice - a lot!

One of the things that I found the most interesting is how accessible this program is.  I've been able to draw a sketch of my house and add to it one of the extensions we've planned on doing, by expanding the front porch.  This way when the naysayers in my family reject my great ideas, they can see them first.

The largest flaw to this program was that I was not able to use if very effectively until I had a textbook.  This program came with 10 `recipe' cards which spoke only to using the getting started up to align and block attributes.  I would have been able to use it for a lot more things had I understood it better.

My computers caused me a great deal of difficulty getting this program operational.  I had difficulty at first, because my computer was at the lower end of the requirements for RAM and was a little slower than necessary.  I added memory to the computer and that helped.  But then I tried installing Parallels and then Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro and found that most things I ran using that were a little sluggish, including this program.  These were all user errors, obviously.  Eventually I had to get a new PC for work and on this one, a Toshiba Satellite, all is well in my PC world.

The past year I have been using 360, and been very happy with it.  One challenge I had was figuring what to use. They had Norton Antivirus, Norton Internet Security and Norton 360 and I was not totally sure what each did. The new Norton Security is an effort to merge Norton products into one subscription service. The only option is the backup.

Installation was really simple.  There was no CD in the box  only a credit card size key card.  It was a bit difficult to get at because the code was on the back of the card which was glued to a larger card.  After that, you log into their site with your account and enter your license key for the installation.  From there you can download the installer for your Windows, Mac, or Android device and proceed with installation. You can also send an email to the device you want to protect. Either way, installing protection is a snap.

It requires a restart, and then Norton automatically launched an installation process, which took about 4 minutes. I had to repeat the process for each of my 3 computers (you can protect up to 10 devices).

The dashboard window is simplified with four large panels labeled Security, Identity, Performance, and More Norton. If you've chosen the edition with backup, you'll also have a Backup panel. Clicking a panel causes the whole row of panels to shrink down, exposing buttons that perform specific tasks. It's a nice change from previous editions.

Clicking Settings brings up a window that seems less cluttered than previous Norton products. A series of checkboxes lets you quickly turn components on or off. It comes out of the box configured for maximum security, but you can change the controls if you really want.  My guess is that most users won't need to change anything.

Im not a computer antivirus guru.  I want something that is easy to use and does a good job. So far, this has been even better that the previous Norton 360. Independent tests performed by Dennis Technology Labs, gave Norton their highest rating of 5 stars.  The other programs receiving 5 stars were Kaspersky,  ESET, Bit Defender and BullGuard.

Norton Security with Backup also adds an online backup service with 25GB of free space. More is available at additional cost if you need it.  I back up most data on an external hard drive, but I like an additional back up of key data online.

Since I bought this product Intuit has discontinued development of Quicken. They are supposed to sell it to some other vendor. I've never seen a software sale of this magnitude work. For that reason alone this would be a two star rather than three star purchase.

What takes it down to 1 star is that today I'm getting Quicken emails about spending patterns. I did not (knowingly) enable online access to my accounts.

Don't use this product.

--------
The market for personal finance software is not what it was 15 years ago. It is now a niche market. (The reason why that happened is beyond the scope of an Amazon review.)

I am sure nobody would develop Quicken for Windows (the gold standard) today. It's development was funded in a different era, including the painful process of establishing connections to banks. So we can't compare a new product (Quicken for Mac 2015) to that product. If you want all those features you need to run windows in a Mac VM or do dual boot.

So we compare this product to using a spreadsheet (ugh) or iBank 5. Unfortunately that's a very hard comparison to make. I mentioned this was a niche market -- I've not seen any serious head-to-head comparisons from a trusted source.

I opted for this product assuming it leveraged the bank connectivity network funded by Quicken for Windows. It does indeed do that.

It is not a stellar product. It desperately, desperately, needs a manual -- but the finance market is now so small that even niche ePublishers won't write a guide for it. Installation and configuration was quirky. Manual setup of 529 and other non-integrated investment tools is weird. I ran into several UI bugs and usability issues.

There's no Help file.

On the other hand, after initial setup it's bringing data in from a variety of investment sources and multiple US bank accounts. That's something.

But not much else has changed since the 2013 version. However, the Premium version is still a better bargain, over the Sage 50 Complete Accounting 2014 software, with more features.

One of the biggest peves I have with Sage is their marketing ploy on how they label the stages of product.

Basic = Pro (You'd think ""Pro"" means top of the line... here you would be wrong)
Better = Complete (Doesn't ""Complete"" mean everything, the whole package?)
Best = Premium (Does not compute)
Elite = Quantum (...Describing nature at the smallest length-scales... so shouldn't this be considered ""Basic""?)

Although you are getting a descent accounting and inventory software, they are continually marketing additional add-ons and sales pitches to buy even more of their products, which should already be inclusive to the software; as reference to their title ""Complete"". It's pretty annoying after a bit.

One of the catches with this software is that it is auto-renewing. So in order to activate this software, your going to have to give them your credit card number in order to get started. Personally, I feel this is an over-the-top lock-in, so to say. They should be more like your anti-virus subscription, letting you know that your subscription is about to expire, giving YOU the option of renewing instead of them just automatically renewing.

So if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage. So you better know right off the bat if you are ready to make a true commitment to using Sage 50 Accounting software, because that is truly what it is... a commitment!

If you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget and can absolutely commit to using this software. However, if you do not need the the Payroll & Tax software, then this is indeed a good software.

As successful as this low-end product has become, it has one flaw: it retains the steep learning curve of its big brother. I am of two minds here. As a powerful stand-alone 2D package, AutoCAD LT 2012 has a depth of capability that few will use completely. That depth deserves some learning (or better yet, professional training). Makers of other high end packages have successfully built low-end tools that are easier to learn: Adobe Photoshop Elements comes to mind. But Elements provides only a small subset of the functionality of Photoshop, unlike AutoCAD LT 2012, which provides virtually the entire AutoCAD feature set (except 3D).

What I learned from intuit help forum:

Problem Scenario (just like mine): ""I am currently on the File -> How would you like to get your federal refund? page and I do not see an option to receive part of the refund on Amazon Gift Cards. The only options that I see are Direct Deposit, Paper Check and Split into Multiple Accounts.""

Resolution: ""it is past that section. Enter that you want the refund to be deposited to your account, and enter bank info. The page will come up after that.""

I did that, and sure enough, it worked! I see option: ""I'll use all or some of my refund to purchase an e-gift card and get an extra 10%"" And the Amazon logo is there, etc.

Cool!  :-)

Hope this helps somebody else to bypass a bad moment I had there.

Also note that, to get the Amazon Gift Card, you have to e-file and Not split your refund over multiple accounts (just one bank account). Some other restrictions are there, but don't apply to an average guy like me.

For about 10 years now, I have enjoyed the perfection of the Turbo Tax software.  Only one year did I have an install issue, and that was quickly resolved by Customer Support.  And as a bonus - the tip I got from the support rep has been used to resolve other software installs and shared with others over the years.  (Thanks *again* to ""Rey"" from Turbo Tax customer support!)

Love the way I can import last year's tax data and don't re-type squat!  This is HUGE to me!  W-2s are tedious!

-> Please note, I always go with the CD/ROM version exclusively.  (I note that the download version reviews aren't so hot this year)

You just can't beat the completeness, rapidity and perfection of the Turbo Tax experience as delivered on the CR/ROM version.

I was able to do the Schedule D (stocks) even tho the higher versions are recommended.  Again, in contrast .... the download Deluxe version does NOT do the Schedule D whatsoever (must go to Premiere or higher) -- so this is another reason to go with the CD/ROM.

On the CD/ROM Deluxe version you can enter your stock sales, and functionality is not broken whatsoever!  Also applies to CD/ROM Basic version too -- I used Basic for Sched D last year and prior years.

Went with Deluxe this year for the 10% gift card bonus -- In contrast, Basic CD/ROM version  is only 5% bonus on the gift card.  So the Deluxe version will be money well-spent, cuz  I'm gonna put a LOT on the Amazon Gift Card, whoa yea!

On first glance, Corel PDF Fusion seems like it may be one of those alternate products.  It comes from a respected name in the industry so I would tend to trust it more than some free or really cheap solution I found on the internet by doing a Google search.

That said, if you read the product description you will find that the major purpose of this software (and it is in the name, too) is to assemble a PDF document from multiple file/software formats into a combined, integrated document. There are limited abilities to edit, crop, make modifications to the content, etc. But the main thing is it is to fuse several different source documents into one PDF file.

The product installed easily enough. In terms of does it do what it is supposed to do?  Well, for basic tasks it does fine although personally I think the interface is a bit confusing. If you want to do any detailed editing or modifications, this product doesn't do that very well and I don't think that is what it is supposed to do. But what can you expect from something that is priced about 1/10 of Adobe Acrobat?  Even less now, since the price has been pretty heavily discounted by Amazon.  You get what you pay for. If you really want creation and editing capabilities and a real ability to work with a PDF file you will have to bite the bullet and pay the money for Acrobat. I have a full version of Acrobat and there is just no comparison. Of course it costs a lot more money but that's why there is a difference in cost, because not only of the capabilities, but of the results. It's like how I've found when it comes to replacing an HP inkjet cartridge, compatibles just don't cut it - you have to get the HP OEM cartridge for it to work properly.

But according to users in the PC World forums, you can still use Office 2000-2002, especially Word and Excel, but might have problems with Outlook 2000, IF IF IF you configured it to run your email (the email passwords won't store, when Outlook 2000 is run from Win7 OS).  Google for PC World Office 2000, 2002 and for Windows 7.  Replace 'PC World' with 'MS Answers Forums' to see the same issues discussed in MS Answers Forums.  Pity that MS won't support its own products, when the newer versions of the same products, are worse.

SHORT SUMMARY: The #1 reason to buy this older (pre-2003) software, now that it's outdated -- is for backwards-compatibility.  And, some of its older functions work better than in Word 2003 et seq.  And, if you migrate to Win 7, you'll lose Outlook Express (one of the few stable and good programs MS has written, so OF COURSE they get rid of it).  So you'll have to learn Microsoft Outlook, anyway.  This matters most, because Outlook after version 2000, stinks.  Your other alternative will be SmartSuite version 9.8 and prior, from IBM.  Those versions are also backwards-compatible.  Latest SmartSuite might not be able to read DOS files from Win7, IBM told me.  But SmartSuite itself, is able to run in Win7, per MS' own listing of 'compatible' programs.  So try buying here in Amazon, earlier versions of SmartSuite, which run between $6 - $50 (versions 9.8 and prior).  I'm testing those, so am writing reviews of SmartSuite as well (review is still in progress).  The latest version of SmartSuite can only be purchased at IBM, so far as I can tell, but it's still called version 9 (but is later than the versions sold here at Amazon).  The latest version costs about $400, so you'd be smart to get an earlier version here in Amazon, see if you like it.

For later versions of Word (or SmartSuite) can read Word 2000-2002 files, as well as files in other older programs for Windows (SmartSuite can read more older files, even from DOS).

Why is that important?  These older Windows programs thus become BRIDGE programs to enable later MS software to read word processing and spreadsheet software which is PRE-2000.  In short, you open those older files in Word/Excel 2000-2002, and then CONVERT them into Word/Excel 2000-2002.  At which point, later MS software can work with the same file.  Else, it's toast. So if you have many old files, you need Office XP 2000 or 2002, as a 'bridge' back to your old files.  So now the question:  WHICH?  2000, or 2002?  No simple answer. Depends on what Office products you're using now, and whether you use Acrobat. The rest of this review is on these complex questions.

WARNING:  Windows 7 will not work with Outlook 2000.  Lots of complaints about that, in MS Answers forums.  Problem with passwords;  they won't store in Outlook 2000, when operated in Windows 7, because Windows 7 no longer allows you to use email directly from your computer;  you have to use it in conjunction with Windows Live mail -- a horrible thing.  (Why MS keeps on wrecking its own older-but-good features, is beyond my comprehension.)

So if you're planning to use Outlook 2000 in Windows 7, DO NOT install it with email enabled.  Maybe then it will work in Windows 7, because people have told me they can get Office 2000 to work even in Windows 8, but without Outlook email enabled.  So maybe you can install it and only in the new Windows version, enable email?  I don't know, but it's worth a shot.

====== OFFICE 2000 versus 2002 ======

Office 2000 works best in Win98SE and XP Home.  Office 2002 runs better in XP Professional; because the service packs convert Office 2000 into Word 2002 -- with bugs. So if like I did, you then reinstall 2000 to get rid of the bugs, the reinstallation conflicts with the updates. So that problem is solved if you upgrade to Office version 2002.

BUT BEWARE:  select CUSTOM installation of 2002. If you're on Windows XP Professional OS, DO NOT UPGRADE OUTLOOK 2000 to 2002.  So don't install Outlook 2002, if you're using Outlook 2000.  That's what I did (see last three paragraphs of this review).

====== OUTLOOK 2000 versus later editions ======

Outlook 2000 still beats the competing PIM and other calendar management software 'out there' for Windows, if you have a lot of recurring events in your year, i.e., you are an tax accountant, actuary, tax lawyer who deals with annual IRS deadlines.  Outlook is too much hassle to use, unless you have a lot of legal or other deadlines which you must track annually.  Same would be said if you are a buyer or supplier of regular shipments.  Buggy and cumbersome though Outlook is, once you properly set it up for recurring events/appointments, they keep on going forever.  Holidays, not so good: the list is stale-dated after a few years;  it's a hassle to go to MS to update your holidays, but they do provide updated lists (current one runs 2007-2012).  I just don't use them, have a paper calendar for that stuff.

Here's how I use it:  your usage will of course differ, but you can tell the PATTERN, and then adapt for your needs.  Key here is RECURRING DEADLINES.  Everyone has recurring deatlines.  Outlook shines in that respect.  So (as stated again below), a) I keep a thin wireback 8.5 x 11 paper calendar for basics on holidays, and workload planning.  Easy to store in the files, easier then to get a sense of where to look for stuff in Outlook.  Next, b) I programmed legal deadlines in Excel based on the client year end, because in pensions you end up having six or seven separate deadlines a month, centering around the 15th  and the end of the month, based on the Plan or client fiscal year end.  It's a nightmare.  So that master list of deadlines based on year end, helps a great deal.  Finally, c) in Outlook I then plotted a generic calendar by year end, so the deadlines show as 'events' in my calendar each day, week, month.  So Outlook is a glorified alarm clock.  Hassle to program, but easier than using a PDA or cellphone.  (Sidekick is next best, but you can't really run it properly in a DOS window, after Win98SE.)

A client is likewise an 'event' keyed to that particular year end.  Because in my business, the penalties are high for missing deadlines.  IRS almost always forgives the penalty if you've good reason for being late, but no one wants to go through that angst.  Hopefully this paragraph gave you ideas you can extrapolate for your own usage.

You might want to know about printing.  You can print any configuration you'll likely want, but remember that the longer the timeline per print job, the smaller the font needs to be, and the harder it will be to get decent output.  Daily, weekly, monthly works well.  A whole year can be done, but it's not useful.  You can configure the day/week/month with filters to create a blank calendar.  But that will cost you more time than if you just bought one.

Frankly, you'll waste time to print calendars.  The minute you print them, you'll find something you need to change.  So better to go paperless, if you need something to distribute: for this, you print to pdf.  Lots of good pdf printers out there, and you probably already have one on your machine.  My favorite is Smart PDF Creator Pro, but I also have Acrobat 9 (the latter creates the smallest file size of any pdf print program I've seen).  So you 'print' to the pdf printer on your machine, saving paper, time and guilt when you find, five seconds later, that the format is screwy or you left something out.  Outlook also exports to devices:  here it might matter that you use Outlook 2003, depending on your device.  Many more devices are configured to interface with Outlook, than with the other PIM software 'out there'.  It's usually a hassle to set up the first few times, because the names in your device don't match the names in Outlook, so you go through trial-and-error finding out which OUTLOOK names 'port' to your device.  But in the end, it is worth the effort.

Frankly, the old At-A-Glance monthly or weekly calendars are great.  But the problem is, if you have a lot of complicated recurring items you'll later need to SEARCH for, the paper method is no good.  So I keep paper for just the basics (like holidays and planning out my workload), but record the details in Outlook.  Stuff done stays in Outlook forever if you want it to, and you can archive anything for any period, manually or automatically (pick manual, never trust MS automated anything).

Outlook 2000 is the best version.  It's 'views' are very configurable;  it's extremely buggy (as is true of all MS products), but is better than later versions of Outlook. On XP Home, Outlook 2002 will 'obey' the Outlook 2000 settings you have, but you lose future 'view' configurability.  Outlook 2003 will not recognize the Outlook 2000 settings on XP Home; nor will Outlook 2002 on XP Professional OS.  I don't know whether the settings will be recognized on Win7, since I won't upgrade to that terrible, new OS.  (Win 7 is still VISTA, but with some corrections.)

Outlook 2000 can display custom-sized and positioned units, all on the same 'page': tasks, calendar, etc.  For example, you can widen or narrow dimensions;  say, Notes and Tasks alongside a daily or weekly calendar.  Again, THE reason to get Outlook, is its ability to set recurring events, and link them to notes, tasks, and journalling.  Bugs all have workarounds.  Since this is software you'd use daily, you'll get used to the workarounds.

(Old Borland Sidekick, and the old Lotus Metro were less buggy, but also less configurable.  Forget WordPerfect's PIM.  All business contact management software, stinks.  Been there, done that, have the war wounds.)

By contrast, Outlook 2002 (in XP Pro) et seq. only allow one view at a time, Calendar OR Notes OR Tasks. You must open new windows to view, say, Notes and/or Tasks alongside each other; of course you must resize the windows each time. So you're constantly stuck with moving them around.

In short, the last viable version of Outlook, is 2000.  Part of its viability ports over when you upgrade in 2002 in XP Home; but only data is ported over for Outlook 2003, which is utterly dysfunctional.  For example, your 'contacts' begin with REAMS of BLANKS, and there is no option for NAME fields.  What drunk designed that ????  The only way you can deal with it is to sort DESCENDING, or GUESS how many BLANKS you must first delete before you can reach the 'A' in contacts.  God forbid you click on any of the letters (which are supposed to be address-book-tabs), and above all don't click on 123, because then you can't sort at all -- well, until you leave 'Contacts', at which point when you return, your names are necessarily bass-ackwards.  But at least then you can see how many BLANKS you have to delete, and then reset sort to ascending.  Still, you can't organize FIELDS in Contacts.  Oh, wait -- you can specify the fields, but you can't SEE them, and there is no 'current view' available listing NAMES first.  None of this hassle applied in older versions of Outlook.  Unbelievable.

But finally, Outlook 2003 allows you to specify a certain folder to open on startup (i.e., your calendar, instead of that useless Outlook Today with too much white space and no configurability).  In Outlook 2000, you specify this by selecting Tools Options Other Advanced Options button, then pick what you want to display at startup from the drop-down box. (Sorry for the arcane step names.  Clarity is not, an MS forte.)

Outlook 2003 imposes problems when editing tasks, i.e., the highlighter seems to be on one task though you've clicked on a different one, so you'll think you delete the HIGHLIGHTED one; but instead you deleted the task on which your CURSOR (not mouse), resides.

Something must be wrong with the water, in Redmond WA.

Outlook 2002 et seq, FORCE TWO LINES OF ICONS.  You can't uncheck that Options box. When installing In XP Professional, it crashes, then tells you it can't use your prior version settings or your store, would you like to use the default. If you say no, the program quits. If you say yes, it wipes out your prior settings, and you have to do them all over: that's a week's work.

Same 'week' cost is true for Outlook 2000, but when you get it configured rightly, it's a decent program;  it has a nice PDA transfer capability, is easy to import and export to other formats.

====== PHOTO EDITOR 2000 versus later editions ======

DO NOT UPGRADE THE PHOTO EDITOR, either.  The 2000 version is much more full-featured.  The 2002 replacement isn't bad, but it's not as good as the year 2000 version.

====== OTHER OFFICE PROGRAMS (excepting Word and Excel) ======

Business Contact Manager, Front Page, Power Point and Access are useless programs, all glitch and no gain.  You might need Access, though, as many other non-MS programs, use its structure and features.  MS Power Point can result in a pretty slide show, but in Windows Movie Maker you can do more, and more easily.  (Pity Microsoft is so short-sighted, it won't modernize WMM.  MS is losing profits, by not modernizing it.  Again, the MS programs that are actually USEFUL, get scant MS attention.  The programs we NEED to be useful as well but are so buggy you itch for a gun, are 'upgraded' to be more buggy, still.)

Document Imaging and Scanning is marginally better in Office 2002, can be quite useful.  The default tiff file is easy to manipulate, small in size, and most older scanners can thus 'talk' to MS Document Imaging (i.e., the Brother line of MFC).  You have to tweak the MS settings each time; but especially for older scanners and files, these programs are a godsend.  They are somewhat easier to use than Acrobat and PaperPort, but operate along much the same lines.  Like MS, Acrobat is phasing out backwards-compatibility.

====== WORD and EXCEL 2000 and 2002 versus later editions ======

Acrobat can't work with Word post-2002, though it claims compatibility.  It can't work with Word 2000, per its own website (see my review on Acrobat 9, here in Amazon.)

So that leaves Word 2002 and Excel 2002.  GET THEM, if you ever used Win98SE or even Win 3.1 -- and thus have old computer files from that time and prior.  Office 2002 is the last MS version to support backwards compatibility with the powerhouse software of yesteryear (Word Perfect, Quattro Pro, Lotus 1-2-3, Ami, etc).  Later versions ELIMINATE backwards-compatibility; and worse, impose a 'restriction policy' you can't override without screaming (see my review of Word 2003 in Amazon).

So you will need Office 2002 or 2000 to READ older files.  Moreover, older software CANNOT SEARCH the drive. WordPerfect through X5 cannot search its own files on a disk.  Only can search its own files within a directory of a disk.  Windows, by contrast, can't read WordPerfect files to search for text.  This was not a problem in 98SE, but is a problem now.  So if you don't have some 'bridge' software that CAN read those old files, you're stuck.

If you're on XP Professional OS, then old spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3 wk1's, must be converted via an older version of Excel; to enable a later version of Excel, to read the file.  In XP Home (but NOT Professional), Office 2003's Excel CAN read Lotus 1-2-3 files, but later versions of Excel, cannot;  because, in later versions, the wk1 format is deemed dangerous, and you can't fix the Excel default to accept that format.  So, you'd have to convert the wk1 to an Excel format. This is especially true, if you want your family/friends/clients to read wk1 files.

Any version of Office is mediocre, buggy; what automation they should allow, they prohibit.  What automation they impose, wrecks your work. For example, DEFAULTS at installation involve 'autoformat' and 'update style', which on the surface, sound harmless and even beneficial. But if you don't spend hours examining and unchecking these and other defaults prior to creating an important document, you'll have regrets.

Example: say you install, didn't check the defaults, and start to write a document. You create bulleted lists. When you've reached page 18, you decide to reformat the indentation and type of bullets on THAT page.  YOU think you're only changing the format of the latest bullet list.  Surprise surprise -- ALL your previous bulleted lists, ALSO changed to CONFORM to your latest 'auto update style'.

So everything's bass-ackwards with MS software:  before you do anything, you must carefully review every default setting, and figure out how to change it.

So TURN OFF ALL AUTOMATED FUNCTIONS just after installation.  Before you create any document, call up each program and examine its Options and Customize and Autoformat.  It will take all day to figure out what you must turn off or on. Then hit the SAVE (floppy disk) icon to save, without naming the document/spreadsheet.  For that first document/spreadsheet which comes up, is the DEFAULT.  Word's default is Normal.dot, and Excel's default is Book1.xls.  But you won't see the former's name when you open Word;  instead, it labels as Doc1.doc;  but it IS, Normal.dot.  So make your changes to the Options (including Color, for Excel), then hit the SAVE (floppy disk) icon to save it IN the default.

So always have a backup copy before you edit in Word or Excel 2002.  Never trust that what you edited, was all that changed.  Read the entire document over.

What about their vaunted templates?  Yecccch.  And what if you design one of your own?  Well, here's the problem: you can't SEE the formatting so if you backspace, you just wiped it out.  Thankfully, there's 'Reveal Formatting' (in 'Format' menu, or separately moveable as an icon -- tricky thing to create it).  So if your Formatting is REVEALED (by a frame on the right side of your document) -- as you type, you can see what formatting is used for that line.  This is far better than Word Perfect's stupid Reveal Codes, but the latter at least smartly warns if you're deleting a 'style' or 'format'; or (at least in WP 9) flat presumes you only mean to delete text.  Now if only WP would get rid of auto-formatting for a printer hooked up to your system...

Word is not so smart.  It could be MADE to be smart, if they souped up their current option to 'show formatting marks' to INCLUDE the style identifiers.  So you can't see the STYLE, except via Reveal Formatting' frame at right of your document.

It is easy to change and add styles, but spend the hour or two it takes to figure out how to add those styles to Normal.dot, because a changed style only 'stays' with the document you edit.  Same problem is true for Excel, but Excel allows you to always COPY to and from Book1.xls, as you work.  This matters a bunch, for MS default colors are egregious.  In Excel but not Word, you can change the colors, save them to Book1.xls, and then 'copy' them into whatever other worksheet you later open.  Else, any colors you change (using Tools Options Color tab), are only good for that worksheet and maybe for that SESSION.  (It's quirky: sometimes my Tools Options Colors modifications for a worksheet; save; and sometimes not, though I always go through the same steps, and have been doing this for years.)

=== OTHER TIPS ===

A.  In Word, check the box in General tab which asks to be prompted to update the default template, 'Normal.dot'.  Else, any changes you make in program function (i.e., icons or options), won't be preserved once you close the program.  Similarly, if you goofed up your settings during a session, when prompted to update at close program, you can select 'no'; thus your goofups won't be saved. :)

B.  Word is notorious for not enabling underlined blanks.  So to make blank underlined spaces, select Tools Options, then select the Compatibility tab, and check off 'draw underline on trailing spaces'.  Then hit the 'default' button at lower right, and click Yes.  You've just enabled underlined blanks in all future documents. To enable them in past documents: repeat the foregoing steps, after having opened each such other document.  The other way to do it, is to tap out your spaces, end them with punctuation, then paint UP TO the punctuation mark you made.  Word will then draw the underline -- BECAUSE that punctuation mark is on the same line.  Weird.

C.  Comments in Word are incredibly stupid.  You're better off making footnotes or endnotes or objects, since you can optionally hide these from printing.  Bookmarks are a great alternative, since you can bookmark a section, so when the person clicks on it, can be redirected to the comment on some page not to be printed, then use the 'Web' Menu's back or forward buttons, to return back to where he was reading.  Comments in Excel are even more stupid, and no matter how you set them, a) you can't set a DEFAULT NOTE STYLE so are stuck with the ungainly defaults the stupid programmers impose; b) every time you load the worksheet, when you go to EDIT the comments, your comment on edit might be MILES AWAY from the cell (though anchored to the cell, properly readable as a comment).  I've spent hours slowly moving some edited comment which is anchored, say, to column E, but when opened for edit is somehow suddenly the size of a thin line, and way over in column FN, where no worksheet cells are active.  Doesn't matter whether you set the comment to move and resize with the cell, or move but not resize (no reason NOT to move the comment for a cell).  Each single comment must be individually formatted, but all formatting options are available.

D. In Excel, to make the Print Preview show color, select a PDF printer in Page Setup, and make sure that 'black and white' is NOT checked in Page Setup Sheet tab.  This enables you to print to pdf file, and keep the colors.  A black-and-white printer will print colors as shades, anyway.  So you don't need to do anything special.  (Older printers couldn't print shades, so the 'black-and-white' option in Page Setup Sheet is something of a holdover.  Any laser printer I've worked with, naturally recognizes color as a shade of gray.  If you have a color printer, generally you won't want to print black-and-white, either, as black ink is more expensive for color printers.)

E.  Editing text in Excel actually allows you full formatting options.  Edit in the formula bar, and when you want to bold or color or highlight only a specific portion of the text, then do it like you would in Word: select the text then pick whatever formatting you want to apply to the selection.  You can also conditionally format cells, but it's buggy and limited.  3-D type function is easy enough, where in one tab you reference another worksheet by tab name -- what's hard, is that the instructions don't make it clear, how to do this.  It's TABNAME!Cellname  -- be sure to include the exclamation.  Cellname can be either a named range or an address.  If a named range, be sure you've allowed 'accept labels in formulas', in the Tools Options Calculation tab. This is especially important if you're importing a spreadsheet with named ranges (i.e., from Lotus 1-2-3).  If you don't allow those 'labels', ALL YOUR NAMED RANGES ARE CONVERTED TO CELL ADDRESSES INSTEAD, AND YOU CANNOT RENAME THEM.  So says Excel help.  I've not tested that warning for accuracy.

F.  Else, in either 2000 or 2002, the footnotes, endnotes, section headers, table of contents, etc. are cumbersome but useful.  The 'styles' are quirky;  sometimes a backspace while working on a document, undoes or changes the style to something bizarre.  Bookmarks are handy. Customize your icons, to save time later.  In Word/Excel 2002, they insanely group the icons so that too much space is used.  So to end that problem, you must move the icons around to make them fit in the top window line (next to 'Help');  then, fit the rest of the icons so that they only take up ONE line. This fixing, takes hours.  Again, the stupid DEFAULTS pay no attention to customer need, usage, or even common sense.

G.  Word can't merge well with a database.  Comma-delimited or a text file is all it really knows.  But WordPerfect, is even more cumbersome and glitchy.  After years of trying to get either program to merge well, I fell back to my old DOS Multimate Advantage II.  I use old DOS Sidekick on a 486, to create a paste file which then runs the merge.  There ought to be a way to do the same thing in either Word or WordPerfect, but I've not found it.  (IBM's SmartSuite version 9.8 backwards, claim to enable real merging with a named range in a spreadsheet, even with DOS Lotus 1-2-3.  I'm testing that claim, now.  Will post its results in my SmartSuite review here in Amazon.)

====== SUMMARY AND INSTALLATION TIPS ======

SUMMING UP: On the whole, Office 2002 or 2000 is good enough for basic functions like a letter or a simple spreadsheet; for pretty colors but minimal functionality. Excel's ability to do complex calculations -- especially with dates -- is awful. However -- very ironic -- if you programmed the functions in DOS Lotus 1-2-3, the pre-2003 versions of Excel recognize them correctly, and suddenly can handle dates and other complex calculations.  In short, to make Exel really excel, you need DOS Lotus.  (Oddly, Lotus Release 3-5 for Windows, can't handle these calculations well.  SmartSuite did seem to recognize/calculate the functions correctly, when I uploaded a DOS Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet into SmartSuite version 9.6 and 9.1.)

Hence the need for Office 2002 or 2000, in order to 'read' your wk1 files, and make Excel, useful.  (Years ago I begged IBM to re-release DOS Lotus 1-2-3 -- they own its rights, now -- and never got an answer.  So the only way you can get DOS 1-2-3 version 2.x, is to buy it from the secondary market, i.e., some 'vintage software' warehouse.  Check here in Amazon, maybe someone's selling it.)

Again, Office 2002 runs more smoothly than 2000, in XP Pro;  but Outlook in 2002 is inflexible, compared to the 2000 version.  There are also more add-ins created for 2000.  Another flipside: 2002 is compatible with Acrobat 9 and X, but 2000 is not.  Not to worry: buy Smart PDF Creator Pro, which can what Adobe can do for a much lower price; and will work with these older MS Office programs.  So I just use Smart PDF Creator Pro with pre-2002 MS Office (and anything else).

Also, get the CONVERTERS, so that 2002 (or 2000) can read and use LATER versions of Word and Excel (like xlsx and docx extensions).  The converters do work.  Google on fileconverters.exe , to get the download from Microsoft.  That's its program name.

So now you're looking at a hybrid installation, Word 2002 and Excel 2002, but older versions of Outlook and Photo. On XP Pro OS, I installed Office 2003, over 2000; then uninstalled 2003, because it's so clunky and dysfunctional; then installed 2002; then uninstalled Outlook 2002, then reinstalled ONLY Outlook 2000 (to a different directory).  Works well, and all my overrides of the defaults, still work.  Will do the same for Photo 2000, later.  I always prefer the full version of the software to upgrades.  I hope you know, that even the upgrade version IS a full version.  But then you might have copyright concerns later.  Best to buy each 'upgrade' as a full version, so you can continue to separately use the old version, on some other machine.  Here, you've seen how that might be needful.

Alternative is to have one machine with 2000, and the other with 2002.  So my XP Pro machine, has the above hybrid;  my XP Home OS netbook, still has Office 2003; which was installed over Office 2000.  My other XP Home desktop, has Office 2002 installed over 2000.  And an old Win98SE laptop, still has 2000.  In short, to assure backwards-compatibility, I have multiple computers from 286 forward;  these run on DOS, Win98SE, XP.  And in case I need it, I have the older programs, too -- like Lotus, Multimate, Word Perfect, Word 97, etc.  Still have Win95 OS, too.  Even, Win 3.1 and 3.11.

This way, you can read files from older software going all the way back to the 1980's.  You know: when Noah was born. :)",BUY for backwards-compatibility with older computer files,1344556800,,

Installation went well, no hiccups. I did have a little trouble getting the LiveUpdate to work but I called up Norton's support and they straightened everything out. I had an older Anti-Virus application installed that I forgot about and they helped me with removing that.

I've also noticed that scans don't seem to affect the computer's performance. Since I love to push my machine to its limits, I tried to think of what is the most resource intensive program I could run while running a scan. So I started rendering a Final Cut X project that I've previously rendered under the same conditions. It completed with only 2 minutes added to the total render time. With that small of a time increase it could very easily be due to the other system processes and all in all would not be noticeable during normal system use.

I know that most people will swear by Macs being pretty much invulnerable to viruses and the likes, and they very so may be correct. However, my view is if I've spent 2.5k on a Mac, $20 a year for assurance that my machine will stay running virus free is well worth it.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for peace of mind. I'm already planning on purchasing the new version for my MacBook Pro Retina whenever they update to 10.8 compatibility.","Macs, still invulnerable?? Hmmmm...",1365120000,,

the best way to upgrade is to buy a new hard drive and do a separate install - do not buy the ' upgrade ' version it will kill your XP license!!

(Received an early copy) I must admit the upgrade experience is a hassle but once you install Windows 7 you will be pleasantly surprised. I recommend a clean install for all users. Windows 7 has a noticeably snappier boot time than Windows Vista. What users will notice most are the changes to the interface. It took some time to get adjust new taskbar but once I became familiar with the new interface, I found it to be an improvement over previous Windows versions. Windows 7 also includes a comprehensive device drivers, I have only had an issue with an old printer where Windows 7 could not find the drivers. But with Virtual XP this was no problem, I simply installed the Virtual XP, and used my printer within the virtualized environment. I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used.

Improvements/Pros/New Features
-New Taskbar interface, each program is represented by an icon for a clutter free taskbar
-Quicker boot times
-Comprehensive driver library
-Supports many devices out of the box
-Less annoying
-Virtual XP (for those who still need Windows XP)
-Networking

I am running Vista on the computer I installed the program on.  Although I followed installation directions faithfully, I was unable to update the product when following the suggested steps.  I could not update it until after I had completed registration, so I would advise registering the product before trying to do much else.  After registering the product, updates were installed seamlessly.  Updating was time-intensive, taking over  an hour over a DSL connection.  Luckily, this appears to be an infrequent occurrence.  After installing the updates, I set up the headset (a minor repair had to made--an ear piece had come apart and was easily fixed), and proceeded to try the program.

At first I was unable to try the program because of sound issues.  Although my system volume was not set high, the sound coming through the headset was entirely too loud to be listened to.  I had to go into my volume mixer and reset a variety of sound levels--and located the separate Rosetta Stone volume control--before volume was at a workable level.  All of the tries at updating and then sound issues made for a very slow start to beginning to enjoy the software.  But once all of the ""dust"" settled and I was able to begin the program, I was very favorably impressed.

The language-learning portion of the program is easy to use and customizable to what you wish to learn.  Are you more interested in spoken language?  Well, you can emphasize that and spend less time with written language.  The program's approach is indeed an immersion approach and doesn't require that you spend time overtly memorizing by rote, as many approaches to learning a language seem to take.  This makes the program a pleasure to use, particularly for visual/auditory learners.  The more you use the program, the more you will find yourself remembering and the more success you will have in your chosen language.  And, the more success you have in learning Italian, the more you will find yourself wanting to use the program.  You will be learning language in the same way a native speaker of the language learns.  The program creates such a positive learning experience, I find myself not wanting to miss a day of practice!

Currently, three of us are using the program, as the program does let you add users on the same computer.  Everyone proceeds at his or her own pace, and you may revisit lessons and set your user interface to learn whatever aspect of language interests you most.  The ability to go back and review is invaluable.  You may also set up your voice recognition software to be more or less ""strict"" about what it finds acceptable in terms of pronunciation.  One of the three program users in the household is taking an accelerated course in Italian at the local university and finds that this program is a wonderful adjunct to the live class, giving them extra practice and a pronunciation leg-up.  Other than the initial set-up hurdles, the three of us give the program a very big ""thumbs up.""  The program is well worth the price.

When I was given the choice to try Norton 360, which I had already used before but did not renew when it expired, I didn't think it twice.

First of all, installation was fast and without any issues, unlike McAfee which asks you to download and install a bunch of stuff you would assume is already in the disc. Norton's interface is very easy to use, and is being continually improved. It is a simple task to find what you need and start whatever action you want to, without having to rely on help menus and the like.

The tools included are the following: Antivirus, Antispyware, Identity Protection, Password Vault (for both Internet Explorer and Firefox), PC Tune-up (Which does a great job in boosting performance)  and Backup (very basic but it's there should you need it)

If I had to mention the one thing I like the most from Norton 360 that would be performance. It does not feel like you have it installed! Scans in the background do not feel at all, I know Norton is scanning items only because a pop up lets me know when done. And that is another thing, pop-ups appear only when needed (some can be disabled if you want) and they are not as annoying as other products out there.

Surfing the web is great with Norton 360, the password vault is a great thing to use if you do shopping and use personal information and credit cards (Firefox offers a similar feature but without the protection Norton offers) Additionally, if you do a Google search for example, Norton 360 will scan the websites listed and let you know which are safe and which are not before actually clicking on the link. If this is not enough, Norton offers a functionality in which you can type the web address you intend to visit and will run a complete scan and even give you reviews of the website from other users before actually accessing it! I ran a couple tests and I can confirm results are reliable (P2P websites and the like are recognized as potential threats by Norton)

The installation took about an hour on my Mac Mini. Perhaps tellingly, at first I could barely distinguish between the old Leopard and the new Snow Leopard. All my settings, dock, programs looked exactly the same; the only difference was the gray-to-lavender top menu bar. Only after using it was I able to begin to see what had changed. NOTE: I currently have this installed on my Mac Mini only. I want to wait several months before converting all my Macs to Snow Leopard.  If you have more than one Mac, get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mac-OS-X-Snow-Leopard-Family-Pack-5-User/dp/B001AMPP0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mac OS X Snow Leopard Family Pack (5-User)</a>&nbsp;since it's much more cost-effective than buying single versions.

The Good:

-- Start up and shut down is, as promised, faster. Likewise, Safari is much faster than even the newest update installed on Leopard. Most other programs run faster as well. These speed differences are noticeable, so, if you are at all impatient, you might want to upgrade for this alone.
-- Microsoft Office 2004 AND 2008 both work as they did before the upgrade. I use these programs frequently, and the fear that they wouldn't be compatible almost steered me away from Snow Leopard
-- Time Machine seems to be much more stable in Snow Leopard, and this is perhaps the biggest plus of upgrading.
-- Snow Leopard includes X-Code tools for developers. I don't use these, so I can't comment except that they exist.
-- Expos&eacute; is a wonderful tool once put in the Dock, although not all users will need or want this access.
-- Computers that currently run Tiger can upgrade, thus skipping an entire OS (Leopard). If you haven't used Leopard, you'll notice a huge difference.
-- So far, I have not had any compatibility issues with the applications I use. Adobe Photoshop Elements requires the installation of Rosetta, one of the optional elements, but, if you don't download it initially, the computer will prompt you to install.

The Bad:

-- At first, I couldn't install because I didn't have enough space on the hard drive for Snow Leopard because of the presence of Leopard. I had to get rid of some old videos and unwanted photos to make room. Once installed, I had the space available to me again. People who have lots of media on their computers will have a tougher time than those that have less content.
-- The difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard are small enough to make this a desirable but not necessary upgrade. The difference is not dramatic -- not at all like the leap between Tiger and Leopard. You'll have to weigh the cost against the benefits.
-- The claims of ""greater stability"" are difficult to test since the original Leopard is pretty darn stable on its own.
-- Some early users have reported internet connectivity issues, although I did not have this problem myself.

Because Snow Leopard is not a step backward, I recommend getting it if you plan to keep your current Mac for a while since future tweaks are often dependent on running the latest operating system. Likewise, if you have a Mac purchased just before the release of Snow Leopard, you should take advantage of the ten dollar upgrade before it disappears. Except for those who still run Tiger,other Mac owners will not miss much in this latest OS X.

Their books are a terrific value - good legal information for the do-it-yourselfer. Whether you're actually doing something or just looking for information, Nolo is a great go-to for many kinds of legal expertise. Please do note that this, like most things legal, may not apply to your state - check to make sure it is valid.

On to Willmaker. We have a somewhat simple need - just need to have something in place to avoid the legal tussles if we were to pass on. There's a peace of mind in knowing that you can speak for yourself after you've left this world and don't want your kids or heirs to have to untangle things or let the state have to do it.

There have been a number of additions to WillMaker since we last set up our wills - notably the digital asset department, which is (we think) essential in this new age. Social accounts, online banking and online anything are really something new to think about and passing control legally to someone is really important. At a minimum, it makes people who will be carrying out your will aware of these things and ensure control over them. One of the biggest problems in death is having someone with appropriate authority and companies holding your ""stuff"" need that legal establishment to provide access and control to someone other than yourself. I see this as becoming more and more important.

WillMaker lets you speak for yourself in your absence, with healthcare directives, funeral and burial desires, cremation, etc. so that it's all very clear. Check the Nolo web site for a complete listing of forms and the processes includced. I especially like the Letter to Survivors - letting your relatives and significant people know exactly why your desires were laid out they way they are and perhaps explain the reasoning. I have a set of specifics and why, and this is a really good answer for me to be able to do this.

You can read about all the product specifics at Nolo Press or in the product descriptions, but as with everything I've ever gotten from Nolo, it's concise and complete. The price is right too, especially considering how much in lawyer fees you will avoid by doing this simple process yourself. And the cost of NOT doing a will would be immense to your survivors and/or heirs. Of course, as they say, it's no substitute for legal advice and if your estate is complex, perhaps a lawyer is in order, but for probably a large majority of us, this is just what the barrister ordered. (sorry for that!)

I felt like giving it 0 stars for how must time I spent trying to activate it. It came with a very long code printed on the sleeve of the DVD it came with but every time I tried to enter it in the program it kept telling me the code was invalid! Only after searching Corel's support website did I find a document dedicated just to this since it must confound quite a number of their customers. The problem was they print their V's right up next to each other so what I kept typing in was a W instead of 2 V's!!! Only good thing about that is that I found out the DVD contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit version of the program. I'm glad I got it all straightened out because this really is a fun program to use.
If you ever used Photoshop Elements or Lightroom a lot of things will look familiar and work similarly to those programs. For example, it opens up to a manage tab where you can see all your photographs as thumbnails and manage them by rating them or creating you own smart collections. It automatically creates collections from photos in your pictures folder based on date, tags, people, places and ratings. Then there is the adjust tab that lets you apply instant effects like artistic pencil, charcoal, black and white 10 different versions, retro several versions also, portrait that includes vignette, soft focus, infrared, smart photo fix, soft focus 1 and 2, skin smoothing, and various others. It'd be nice if it let you import your own custom effects from Painter but if you can I haven't figured it out. There is an option for user defined in the menu and an options button next to the effect but when you click on them they don't seem to do anything though. You also have your basic quick editing tools you'll find in any decent program like crop, straighten, red eye, clone brush, and makeover tool. The makeover tool is cool and something you usually won't find in Photoshop or other free programs since it includes several tools inside like thinify to make people skinny, suntan to darken people's skin, toothbrush to whiten teen, eye drop to whiten eyes and finally blemish fixer. They seemed to work pretty good and easier and faster than I have seen in other programs. The suntan tool for example you just brush over the person's face other parts of the skin and it automatically detects the edges so you don't have to be careful about darkening areas outside the face. Same with toothbrush, thinify, intuitive and very easy to use. Then underneath that is a button smart photo fix that will automatically try to correct brightness, shadows, highlights, saturation based on the histogram. If you don't like what it suggest you can manually correct using sliders that go from -100 to 100 or enter a number in a box. Then below that follow sections for white balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, vibrancy, local tone mapping, high pass sharpen, digital noise removal.
Finally, if you can't find what your looking for in the second adjust tab there is the final full edit tab similar to develop in Lightroom or full edit mode in Photoshop Elements. This is where you have total control over layers, adjustment layers, mask layers, layer styles, basically most of what you would find in an expensive program like Photoshop. This is also where you'll find the most popular features promoted for this program which are Magic Fill and Magic Move. Magic Fill pretty much lets you remove unwanted elements in your pic. Just make a selection around it and the tool will do the work for you and remove it. Magic Move is even more impressive in that it will move something you select to anywhere else in your photo. In practice I found that it only really worked on simple scenes without a lot of complex detail. For example, move a bird person on a sand beach somewhere else and does great job since uniform background. Try to move person in busy street, signs or buildings in background and you end up with jumbled mess and will have to manually tweak the result!
Even though it can be an overwhelming program with so many features for someone that's never used anything more complex than iPhoto, MS Paint, or Picasa it does come with a wizard of sorts like Photoshop Elements called Learning Center that walks you through the steps to accomplish a task. It can be found on the right side of the screen on the Edit tab and there are various sections like Get Photos, Quick Adjustments, Retouch and Restore, Layers and Selections, Text and Graphics, Effects, Advanced Adjustments, Print and Share. Some of them like Time Machine even pop up a second window that shows a preview of what the effect will look like with before and after photos which is really cool (See attached pictures). It even explains what the different types of photos are like Albumen, Cyanotype, Platinum and the time period they were used. After that some others that really impressed me and I had never seen before in a program are Perspective Correction, Single RAW Photo, HDR Merge (although I think Lightroom finally has it in latest version), and Depth of Field (I think new versions of Photoshop Elements also have DOF tool now but I have an older version so don't know). Depth of Field is really cool because you can quickly select an object and blur the background without having to use an expensive lens that provides great bokeh out of the camera or for something like an iPhone that isn't even capable of doing it. Basically, a lot of these neat features are things that could've been done straight out of the camera but weren't for some reason or the other and hence the need for programs like this. Finally, for power users you can script all you actions and then use them to batch process a bunch of photos at once!

So in conclusion as you can see you definitely get a large amount of useful features for you money. I'll continue to use this program on my Windows machine since it has a lot of good stuff and some stuff Photoshop Elements, Picasa, Photoshop (the other Photo programs I use on my Windows machine. I use iPhoto, PE, and Photoshop on my Apple computer) are missing or is harder to accomplish certain tasks like skin smoothing which it does better job than other programs, HDR features, Depth of Field and perspective tools. Unfortunately this program isn't even an option for Mac users and so will have to stick with iPhoto/Llightroom since the new Photos program from Apple is so terrible.",You definitely get a large

I've used various versions of Office for Windows, OpenOffice.org, and Office 2004/2008 for Mac, as well as iWork 06 and iWork 08. I prefer iWork 08 the best, and while Office 2008 is pretty nice, there are some issues I have with it which keep it from being my product of choice.

*Performance: Office programs typically take a few seconds longer to open than iWork programs do. It takes up more ram and makes the whole computer run more slowly than an iWork program does.

*Cost: What is Microsoft thinking? Charging hundreds of dollars for productivity programs (depending on the version), when OpenOffice.org (however ugly-looking and special-feature-lacking it is) is free, and when iWork, a superior product, is well under a hundred dollars.

*Size: The size of all the programs and files in Office 2008 Home & Student is over 900 mb, bigger than it needs to be. iWork+iCal+Mail is less than 700 mb. And Office also has tons of visible files in the Office folder, all of which are executable and pose potential security risks.

*Compatibility: Here's a funny one. I opened a Word document I made in Office 2003 (for Windows, .doc format) in both Pages (from iWork) and Word (from Office). The formatting (paragraph size, margins, etc.) was nearly identical to the original when viewed in Pages, but when viewed in Word 2008, formatting was different! This isn't always the case, though. There was a document I made in Office 2007 (.docx) and formatting was closer to the original when viewed in Office 2008 than when viewed in Pages. But still, Microsoft made Office 2003 and Office 2008, and you'd think they would know how to keep formatting the same better than Apple.

*A bad copy. True to Microsoft's past, they just copied features found in iWork 08 and mushed them into Office 2008, only they didn't do a good job. Like 3D slide transitions really look 3D in Keynote, but they are almost a joke in Office. Or the thing in PowerPoint to help position graphics: it doesn't work with as many items as it does in Keynote. Or controlling PowerPoint with the Apple Remote doesn't work as well, and you can't start a presentation with the remote either.

*Not intuitive. Toolbars are a thing of the past, and you have to keep a side window open for formatting and such. However, if you're viewing the formatting for, say, a chart, you will have no access to basic font formatting at that time.","Pretty features, bad product. I would use iWork instead",1201737600,5,

If you've read the other reviews here, you probably already know how annoying Vista's access control messages are, and how it was incompatible with nearly everything, so I won't spend time railing about that.  The one issue that I could not solve, or forgive, was one of the most fundamental issues for an operating system: file handling.

Vista didn't like copying files across a network.  In fact, Vista took personal umbrage at being asked to transfer files across a network, and passive-agressively reduced the transfer rate down until it could be measured in bits per minute, instead of kB per second.  I soon came to personify Vista as one of those toad-like elderly women behind the counter at the DMV who take perverse delight in watching people's impatience boil into homicidal rage.  The kind of person/operating system that will let you get to almost the front of a two-hour line/95% complete file transfer and then wordlessly put up a ""Next Window"" sign/""File I/O error"" message with just the hint of a malicious grin.  The kind of person/operating system that justifies the ""No Firearms in the DMV""/""Don't keep a hammer near your laptop with Vista installed on it"" rule.

The problem wasn't just limited to network file copies, either.  Copying photos from a USB flash drive to the hard drive took so long that I could have recreated them in MS Paint, pixel by pixel, more quickly and with less frustration.  Where else but in Vista will you see a dialog box with the words ""0.2 of 4 Mb copied, 240 hours remaining""?

My experience with Vista was so abominable that I swore never to give Microsoft another dime of my business, walked to the Apple store, and plunked down way to much money for a Macbook Pro.  OSX has its issues, some of them serious, but OSX makes Vista look like Microsoft literally implemented the ""1,000,000 monkeys with 1,000,000 copies of C++ will probably turn out a well-made operating system"" rule, but decided to save money by giving about 200 monkeys 3 computers and one copy of Q-BASIC.",Finally drove me into the arms of Apple,1257379200,4,

The game's storyline involves a woman searching for her daughter who has been captured by an evil fairy.  The characters find themselves trapped in dreams, involved with fairies- imagination runs high in this game, and those who enjoy fairy and dream-related themes will likely enjoy this.  To play the game you look through each scene for items you can pick up that allow you to further progress through the scene.  For example, if you encounter a door with a lock, you might have to find the pieces to assemble the lock.  The items to solve the puzzles can be hidden anywhere- one might be down a well, for example, so to get to it you might have to find the rope, crank, and bucket.  Crank rusty?  Then you might need to find some oil.  Your cursor indicates when you're on top of something that needs attention, and you can use the clues from these to help you know exactly what you need to find.

Meeks Jr.,"I have not used a speech to text product in some time, the last being Dragon Dictate for Windows from a few years back. This is the first version of Dictate for the Mac that I have used, but the products are similar in how they work.

My goal is to have a way of transcribing voice memos I record with my iPhone. I went through the set up procedure, skipping over the part where it asks you to create a nuance account as part of registration (I guess I will be prompted to do this again later).  For training the software I used a voice recording I made of something I had previously written. It requires 90 seconds of audio to work; I gave it a 2 minute piece. The first pass during the training had a lot of errors which I corrected. The software then translated the voice recording and it still had quite a few errors. I tried again where I made a concerted effort to speak slower and more clearly. This second effort rewarded me with a better translation, but still with errors that I had to edit. I then tried a third time, with a different text, and this further improved, but still with errors.

I then switched gears and tried the voice transcription from a live recording. First I used the included USB microphone. Surprisingly, it worked a bit better, still with errors but fewer. I then tried recording with a bluetooth headset and it worked about as well, so it is the way I will go from now on.

My conclusion is that it is probably unrealistic for me to expect 100% accuracy. If I am focused on good diction and pacing, I can improve accuracy. Using a good audio source with minimal background noise is likely a necessity. The microphone in the iPhone may not be of high enough quality, although I am going to continue to try this route, since it is primarily what I am interested in using the software for. I see potential here, as I have continued to see improvement. I would like for the software to be able to take multiple sample audio files with corrections and use that to improve accuracy. But I think it will continue to improve with time.","Shows Promise, but requires work to get best results.",1401148800,,

Being 36 years old myself, I have yet to worry about that just yet.

At nearly four hundred dollars though, the entry price on this is a bit of a downer. When you look at things in terms of price points, that kind of money, in this economy -- doesn't bode well. I'm reminded of a quote by Matt Damon in the film Good Will Hunting:

""You dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library.""

Yes, your local public library probably has a multitude of learning materials for learning Spanish. A language that is still difficult, but definitely not as difficult as Chinese. If you live in the United States, you would also be hard pressed not to be able to find, or even know, and be friends with some folks who either speak Spanish fluently or do so as native speakers. The Spanish language is so ubiquitous in the US now, a person could almost learn the language just from riding the city bus.

So, the point I'm making here is a simple one. Do you need to drop $400 to learn Spanish? The answer is simple. No. I think of Rosetta Stone like a gym membership. They're expensive and often tedious to pay, but worth it only if you use it.

The product itself is quite good though, if you already have moved past any concerns of money. The system Rosetta Stone employs is state of the art, as they say, and they do their best to immerse you into the language immediately. It really is unlike any other Spanish Language program that's out there for the purchase. So there really is no comparison.

Having been a previous customer with the Rosetta Stone Japanese 1,2,3 ... I was pleased to sharpen my skills in Spanish. Both of them are a fantastic product to say the least.

Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashed frequently --- especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do. This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.

Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.

True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.

After the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.

- Stability is poor.  The system frequently blue screens (crashes) or, more commonly, hangs.  It's not a hardware problem, because both systems experienced these issues, and neither system has any issues running XP.  Vista Media Center slowly degrades over time (one of the computers is my living room DVR) until it is unusable without a hourly reboot (seriously!)
- Speed - I play a lot of games, and Vista is consistently and significantly slower on every single game I've tried.  The difference is significant, even WITH the very latest ""Vista Certified"" video and sound drivers.  Then, there are games that crash on Vista, but have no issues on XP.  You can say ""Well, they were tested to work with XP"", and you'd be right, but I'd rather be running an OS that games were tested with.  And the DirectX 10 effects, which only Vista supports, are very ho-hum - they're not worth the performance hit, in my opinion.  For an example, check out the Crysis DirectX 9 vs. DirectX 10 comparisons on the net.
- Hardware support - this really is not Microsoft's fault, but it is still an issue.  Many hardware manufacturers quietly refusing to release drivers for their existing hardware, in an effort to force people to buy new hardware for Vista support.  That's totally not Microsoft's fault - but make sure your devices are Vista compatible, BEFORE you buy Vista.  Microsoft has a  good compatibility guide on their website for this.  Scanners, printers, music players, phones, and wireless network gear are the gadgets with the worst Vista driver support, as are notebooks not specifically ""designed for Vista"".

It creates clear driving directions that can be emailed as a picture or as an attachment.  The map (either as an attachment or as a picture in the email) is high quality and easy to read.  The email with map and directions was only about 260KB

Another great feature is you can customize fuel cost and MPG city/highway to get fuel cost estimates for the routes that are being planned

Another handy feature is the ability to turn a map into a web page then easily integrates it into your site with either a simple web creator or one such as Front Page or Dreamweaver.

This is probably much more robust than what I needed but it will serve me well being able to email customized directions to my home office for my clients.  In the future I may use it as a tool to map where my clients are located and perhaps develop some marketing tools.

It was far better than any others I have used before. Now my wife and I have tablets as well, and I find myself doing more business on my portable devices.  Norton Small Business-10 Device was perfect for my needs. It works on PCs, Macs, or Android devices..

This  is solid antivirus software that detects most viruses we have encountered in the past. It works on PCs, Macs, or Android devices, and catches viruses that other well known antivirus products could not detect. I love the packaged license deal where we have the flexibility of using one license for multiple devices..

One thing does seem like a step back for me.. I loved just the Norton Antivirus multiple user license because it does not contain the redundant firewall. Now with small business I have to turn off the Norton firewall so both the windows firewall and the Norton firewall don't double up and give me false positives.

Installation was easy. The license lets you install the software from their website with just one key. You can then manage all protected devices from your online account and move protections around as your collection of devices changes.

All of the devices start their protection when the first device is activated.  This can be a bit annoying, but you know when they all need to be renewed.

 The Safe Search Toolbar installs automatically so you can search safely right from your browser. There are plenty of search toolbars available. I like having one that matches my PC security package.

On one hand, WordPerfect Office offers a powerful and very capable alternative to Microsoft Office. As multiple reviewers have already noted, if you really care about a document's layout the ""Alt + F3"" ""Reveal Codes"" feature is pretty much worth the cost of the purchase.

But the X8 version is not really all that different from the last version I used (X4). And what new features have been added pretty much apply to the Standard or Professional version of WPOX8 and not this one (Home & Student). At this point, I have to add that the ""Home and Student"" edition reviewed here is NOT the same as WPOX8 Academic (more on that in a bit).

So what does one get for $99 (Amazon price at the time of this review)? You get the essentials and they are: the WordPerfect document processor (equivalent to MS Word), Quattro Pro spreadsheet (equivalent to MS Excel), Presentations (equivalent to MS PowerPoint), Lightning (equivalent to MS OneNote), and the AfterShot 2 photo processing app. That's it, but that's probably enough for most folks. (Interestingly, Corel offers a stripped down version of this product -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Office-5-3-Installs/dp/B006N1Q0W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Office 5 - 3 Installs</a>&nbsp;(essentially, the Corel version of MS Works) - and I can't help but wonder if, at $30, Corel is hurting WPO sales by offering Office (though I suspect Corel hopes Office will be a stepping stone to WPO)).

For me, the sweet spot (as it pertains to features is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-WordPerfect-Office-X8-Standard/dp/B01EB06R10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel WordPerfect Office X8 Standard</a>. But for some reason Corel puts it out of reach by pricing it at $250. I guess there must be some logic, but I'm not following. If you can qualify for the Academic Edition that's the way to go. For $80 you get WPOX8 Professional (which adds the Paradox database application) for less than this Home & Student Edition. Disappointingly, the Perfect Authority ""table of authorities"" feature is an add-on (at $199) for the Standard and Professional versions; perhaps even more disappointingly, Perfect Authority won't work with this (Home & Student) edition.

If Corel really wants to keep a foothold with the ""next gen"" of users it HAS to update the interface; the software still looks like it did a decade (or more) ago. Frankly, this looked good when WFWG 3.11 was the current OS (and that was 1993)! What with folks moving away from WPO years ago and now folks moving away from the desktop/laptop entirely, Corel has got to do something to refresh the look. Even the free, Open Source LibreOffice has updated its look. It amazes me is that it's the cheaper, less capable product - Corel Office - that uses a MS Word ribbon interface that is far more modern and user-friendly (to the eyes) than WPOX8. So if Corel believes WPO can survive because lawyers still like the pleading and authorities features, okay. But I think it is ultimately a losing strategy.

WordPerfect, despite its looks, is - I believe - a superior product to MS Word (if it matters to you what your document looks like behind the scenes). I have used both since the late 1980s and know that you can do more with the former than latter. Quattro Pro is equally as capable as Excel at most basic tasks, but the world is Excel-based (so most work in QP will have to be ""translated"" for use in Excel). Finally, I think Presentations is a better presenting app than PowerPoint, but once again, the world is PowerPoint-centric. Of the three, the least difficult to transition output over to an MS Office-centric world is WordPerfect (which is fortunate as WP is the reason I think most people buy this suite). Even if this is the case, don't discount the other two: I learned spreadsheets on QP and found it a bit easier to understand the concept of spreadsheets on QP than I did on Excel; same with Presentations (easier to use initially; which is kind of a hoot considering WP's long-standing reputation of having a steep learning curve!).

After Shot 2 is a full version photo editing/adjusting application. I don't do a whole lot of work with photos so my impressions are those of an amateur. But from all appearances it appears to be a comprehensive, full-featured app. It is, however, 1 version behind; the most current version is 3.x (which you will learn about when closing version 2 and being shown an offer to upgrade to version 3 for $49.

One last thought. Usually ""user help"" is an after-thought; the mind set these days seems to be that if you can't figure it out, do an internet search or buy an after-market book. It's pleasing to see Corel not going that route; the Corel Reference Center utility is superb.

Summary: 4 stars. Functional, powerful, capable, at $99 you get a great program at a reasonable price and one that doesn't require an email account to activate and keep active. A 5-star bit of software. But it looks so, so, so old; WPO is in drastic need of a facelift. And the features added to make WPOX8 better than previous offerings is slim. The old look and minimal reasons to upgrade earn -1 star. So while I really want to support Corel's latest edition of WPO, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I think the optimal way to go (if you can't get the Academic version) is either to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordPerfect-Office-X7-Standard/dp/B00JC5Y6WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordPerfect Office X7 Standard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Wordperfect-Office-X7-Home-Student-Product-Key-Card/dp/B00YYCI98K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Wordperfect Office X7 Home & Student - Product Key Card</a>. At $140 you get a more powerful suite in WPOX7 Standard than WPOX8 H&S and don't really miss anything for $40 more than WPOX8 H&S. If one decides to go the H&S route, WPOX7 Home & Student comes in at $40 and is essentially identical to WPOX8 H&S (but less than half the cost). Like I said, not sure I'm following Corel's pricing strategies; to me, Corel has to do something if it wants WPO to remain a viable product.

First, I wanted to plot out a new map that showed the residence locations for the 50 members of a volunteer organization I work with.  This might have an effect on locations for our group efforts in the next year (gas prices being what they are).  The old way would have been to cut and paste the addresses into Google Maps or MapQuest then try to approximate their locations onto a screen print graphic.  Time spent: 90 minutes of digital drudgery.

The MapPoint method was insanely simple.  I took the spreadsheet with the address list, and just imported it into MapPoint.  In less than 10 minutes I had a map of the area with push pin graphics for each member's home.  Another 5 minutes invested, and I had concentric circles to show everyone's distance from a specific focal point.  15 minutes of effort versus 90 minutes expended last year!

Second, I wanted to create a more detailed (customized) view of an educational tour.  Piece of cake!  And I didn't have to resort to any additional graphics package, screen prints or anything.

Because I bought the 2011 version to update 2007, but the 2011 version makes mistakes in calculating a budget, so Intuit's solution was to ""allow"" me to revert to a 2010 version, which they supplied. They said they'd contact me when the problem was fixed so I could go back to the version I paid for, but they never contacted me; now I know why. They moved the faulty 2011 engine to 2012! If I had paid for this 2012 version, I'd be returning it.

It's tough to trust Intuit with budget and money tracking. I have a 2010 version that calculates properly so I will stick with that even though there are other problems I've had to work around. I hope that someday Intuit will change management and once again create new and innovative products that function well. Here is what I found so far:

Pros
*Automatically updated via Internet during installation from CD.
*Kept my interface and report customizations.
*Runs faster than 2010.
*Lots of great tools and features that do function properly.
*60-day money back guarantee.

Cons
*Installer required uninstalling 2010 version. Makes it tough to compare two versions or revert to previous version.
*Automatic update took 15 minutes on a 2.8 GHz computer with broadband connection. Hmmm!
*My old file had to be converted to the new format. Good thing I kept a backup.
*Requires Windows. PC version has multiple problems but Mac version sucks banshee farts.
*Budgeting tool still has calculation problems that originated in the 2011 version. If a money program cannot calculate accurately, what good is it?
*Transaction download issues still abound. Intuit usually blames their server, the bank's server, or recommends deleting the connection and re-establishing it (a lengthy, somewhat complex process).
*Still has trouble dealing with time and suggests restarting the program to fix it.
*Auto-fill is still a nightmare.
*Support is still lame. They may answer the phone better (sometimes) but the solutions they provide do not fix the problem, they tell you how to work around the problem. They have been doing this for years!!!

Intuit has just notified me that they will no longer support 2010 as of April 2013. No more downloading transactions. No more customer ""support."" Not that support was ever really there, but no more downloading transactions? They already have numerous problems with downloading so I must download a file from my bank and import it into Quicken, but two of my accounts work OK. So they are pushing me from a version that calculates properly to one that doesn't. And I've heard nothing good about the 2013 version.

So I obviously recommend getting the newer edition for the same. But I have not tested X5, so here are my comments on X4:

I have always loved WordPerfect, and as expected I love X4. For almost 2 decades now, WordPerfect has earned a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and in my opinion it's much better than Microsoft Word or putting together a quick Word document.

I also strongly recommend Open Office, an open source, completely free office suite. I've used Open Office almost exclusively for the past 5 years, and it's great for ""light"" word processing, and it's spreadsheet is more than adequate. However, if you are a heavy user, need templates like label templates (Open Office is not great at this), or need somewhat sophisticated word processing functions (like image integration), WordPefect is hands-down the best in my opinion.

Additionally, WordPerfect opens any PDF into Word Perfect. It saves in just about any format (including .docx). Others have touted the optical character recognition (OCR) feature, which can convert a scan to text. This in itself is actually not a big deal - almost every scanner has bundled software that can do this. But having it build into the word processor means you can take a JPG image (such as a scanned receipt) & convert it back into text.

If you already have X4, I doubt that I would actually recommend upgrading to X5 - I don't plan on it. But if you're looking for a new word processor, I would suggest checking out X5. As for X4, I give it an easy 5-stars.",Great ... but already outdated. X5 is available for the same price,1306281600,,

That is probably the strongest recommendation that I can bring myself to give for this suite.

I will start with the good on this review, because there is not really that much to say. The product installs easily (remember to uninstall any competitor's product before trying the install of McAfee Total Protection, it will remind you if you have forgotten). Configuration is not difficult and the included products are pretty extensive (read the product description above, it has nearly everything you could hope for in protective software). That, however, pretty well sums up the good stuff.

On the flip side, after installing, I found that the boot time on my dual core Centrino system with 4GB memory, increased by minutes over the 10-20 seconds that I had come to expect with Norton 360 installed. I also had trouble registering the product even after multiple manual attempts. Online support was relatively helpless to help me resolve this problem, at least the first line team. I was eventually bumped to the true technical help (after first being advised to call the fee based help line). At this point the registration completed successfully. Throughout the process McAfee Total Protection had been advising me of new products that I might be interested in (remember those popup windows browsers used to display before popup blockers? Yeah, you get the picture). This required another online help session to turn off that setting on McAfee's end (I was informed that this is a user selectable option, but once it is set, the user cannot change the setting, only McAfee can change it).

All in all, after a couple of days, I uninstalled the suite and reinstalled Norton 360. Boot time is back to what I expect and I do not see any unreasonable slowdowns or spurious alerts messages advertising products.

2264,2264,4.0,False,"05 8, 2008",A1VLVWTLV3LVHR,B00123WD40,,Tim Robertson,"Bento was released by the makers of FileMaker Pro with a very specific purpose. Interestingly, Bento was the name given to a layer in Apple's visionary OpenDoc architecture launched with System 7.5 in the mid 1990s.

Bento is a personal (as opposed to ""enterprise"" or networked) database that's meant to be as easy to use as the Mac itself. It has a carefully-identified set of features. These run parallel to those of iWork's Pages and Numbers. It could have been called i(Data)Base to aim at a comparable niche in the market. Bento complements Pages and Numbers nicely. The criticisms that some users (and reviewers) leveled at Bento, that it lacked, for example, scripting, Automator and network support, miss the point. It was never intended for those sorts of uses - or those types of users; look at FileMaker Pro for such extended power.

Bento was specifically designed and released without such features in order to concentrate on the less-experienced consumer and SOHO user. Some missing areas of functionality might be useful to the non-specialist user. On the whole, though, the balance between price and feature set, not to mention features, means that Bento can be safely recommended.

Bento is designed to accomplish everyday tasks using a pleasing and straightforward template-based interface The very fact that it is simple, has only one window, and just the right number and design of a few uncluttered menus adds to its accessibility and effectiveness as a flexible and powerful tool.

It only takes a quick glance at the lively, comprehensive and very well supported and moderated Bento forum to see how easy it is to achieve sophisticated date calculations and many-to-many implementation; Bento's apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Bento Users is another useful site. The documentation that comes with the product is excellent.

Everyday
FileMaker has compiled a list of some of the more likely projects that Bento can handle. These include:

* what FileMaker, Inc. calls ""virtually unlimited"" contact details
* coordinating events, parties, and fundraisers
* tracking projects, assignments, and deadlines
* prioritizing tasks; Bento has been used successfully in a Getting Things Done task management context
* inventories, donations, and items for sale
* track hours worked, payments due, invoicing
* rate service providers and sellers
* libraries for music, movies, and media
* store files and photos related to projects and events

and, rather cryptically, since this ought to be part of any good data model:

* connect related information together to see more details.

There are ample standalone products to achieve many of these tasks - Project Managers like OmniPlan and task management - the same company's OmniFocus. Bruji's outstanding BookPedia and CDPedia. There are dedicated time management and billing/invoice suites like TimeNet Pro - though none without some flaw; and iPhoto, Address Book and iCal themselves, with the last two of which Bento integrates closely.

It is what it is
So the criteria for MyMac's evaluation must not be, What's missing from Bento? Rather, how well does this reasonably-priced and robust Leopard-only product do what it's been designed to do?

First and foremost, then, is a courageous - and largely successful - attempt to make database design and management accessible to those who are not specialists or experts in such software, but who still have demanding needs such as some of those just mentioned.

Bento's main window consists of three panes:

The leftmost pane is the Source List of all your data Libraries. Libraries are Bento's top organizational level - like iPhoto 7's ""Events."" One Bento Library is for one set of data or project. Under these in the Source List are Bento's Collections; these are like iTunes' Playlists - subsets of the data in the Libraries. Then Smart Collections behave just as you would expect: they're Views updated in real time and as your filter criteria - or the records that matches them - change. You might, for example, want to create a Smart Collection of all unpaid invoices - as they get paid, they disappear; or of all unsold artifacts in a craft store - as they are sold, they disappear.

The records area is in the middle and is the largest pane. Data can be presented as a form (an individual record) or table of as many records as will fit into the space. You can have more than one form for any Library (each may display different fields - in different orders). This is emphasis on the user experience again; it drives the way you work. Each view is satisfactorily editable - columns can be dragged horizontally for display; you can chose which you will view too. The principles, of course, are analogous to those in FileMaker's ""Align"" routines and fit well with the sophisticated controls that Bento offers.

The Associated fields list for each Library is on the right. Fields are created here and dragged and dropped onto the Records area. There are only three attributes for each. There is also control over how many of these three panes will appear - you can focus on what you're doing.

This is a familiar interface; and it preserves the metaphors for data handling on which Bento rests. Similarly, searching, sorting, and summaries are all swift and intuitive. Searching can be very sophisticated and saved as a Smart Collection.

Note, though, that this means that there's no concept of separate datastores in Bento. All the data which you use Bento to maintain is managed in one place. You can still share Libraries with other users. Yet if you organize your data according to ""domains"" within your life (household, work, hobbies, friends, you may find it a disadvantage to access it all in and from one place by launching the Bento application itself as opposed to separately-located data files. On the other hand, this is very much in keeping with current Mac practice: it is the way that iCal, iPhoto, iTunes, iWeb (though not Pages or Numbers) all work. More evidence of the perceived target audience; for them it is assumed the task in hand is more important than file names, file management.

Data Types
Given these intentional restrictions, the substantial variety of data types (nineteen of them) which Bento handles is impressive: basic text, numbers, dates, drop-downs, Booleans, graphics, sounds, movies, ratings, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses and more. There's also a FileMaker-like calculation field which can, for example, concatenate text and multiple fields values as well as perform simple mathematical operations. Inevitably there will be some function missing for someone, but on the whole it's comprehensive - and very easy to use.

Templates
For all its transparency, Bento is not a glorified Wizard. Fields can be controlled - use drag and drop. Fields are rearranged and resized with the mouse - usual Mac style. Some positioning and alignment of text is possible using a toolbar - though probably less than most people will come to want: five text sizes, no choice of fonts. One of the biggest hurdles that the marketing of Bento has to overcome is to make it plain that these are flexible means to an end - although the (new) user's first contact with the program will be the 20 templates that come with the software. These templates are shells; they are not one and the same as the data which they are used to present. If the designers of Bento have understood just what it is that a majority of users want in terms of the payoff between interface and ease of use as opposed to in depth functionality, then they have surely got a winner on their hands. The number of downloads (a quarter of a million) in the first few months since Bento became available suggests that is the case.

Address Book and iCal integration
By default Bento has Libraries for contacts, events, and tasks. These are the same as those in Leopard's Address Book and iCal; they are not synched. Although these Libraries can be removed - ""Disconnected"" - from Bento in its ""Home"" menu, to do so is to lose access to those applications' data. What's more, to edit in Bento - or worse delete - data that's derived from Address Book and iCal is to lose it directly from those same applications actually outside the Bento environment. Integration is tight: you could drag and drop a set of contacts from the Address Book Library right into Bento's Source list to create a Collection. This ""disconnection"" could usefully be supplemented by a preference letting you work from a duplicate and/or advising you that you could conceivably lose permanently (unless backed up) data of which you might have thought you were only working on a copy.

Import-Export
Bento supports only CSV (Comma Separated Value) for import and export of data, although there are ways aplenty to convert that after or before the fact. So that's a limitation only inasmuch as you may need another utility and two steps. The importer is drag-and-drop then Wizard-based and worked very well in testing. The Wizard asks which values from the file to be imported should correspond with which fields in Bento.

Relations
The way that Bento handles relations - the fields in other tables whose data you need to appear in the current one - is one of the program's main limitations: it's not a conventional relational database. But, again, it's an approach designed to give the greatest likely desired power with the simplest steps.

In your ""local"" Library you create a field of type ""Related Records List""; then you indicate from which Library you want to use data. Dropping that field on your form displays a small empty table corresponding to the ""remote"" Library. You click the ""Add related records from a list"" icon at the bottom of the inset table to see actual data. Bento displays the corresponding list of records from the associated library. Changing records in the one changes them in the other. Deleting a record in the ""local"" Library only deletes it only from the Related Records List (the ""local"" dataset) and not from the associated Library. This more closely follows the practice of removing a record from a Smart Folder, Collection or Playlist. It's a way of preventing mistakes - although not entirely logical, until you're used to it. It's also another example of ease of use; accessibility takes precedence. Note, too though, that Smart Collections cannot include data from related tables. That may be a significant restriction for some.

What is likely to be a real drawback, though, is the fact that by ""Related Records"" Bento means essentially a ""Portal"" to all the records in the ""remote"" Library. There is no concept of a ""Join"" using Primary and Foreign Keys. This means that you cannot be selective in the way you relate and view such records.

Conclusions
Bento is a package. A compromise. MyMac's advice is that - after reading this review - you match what it can do against your needs. Almost certainly you may have requirements which Bento seems unable to meet. But look closely. Sure, its interface is user-friendly - and more important, perhaps, Bento itself is easy to use. But this doesn't mean it's in any way crippled and ""less than"" comparable databases of this level of complexity - relational features aside.

It's much closer to Pages, Numbers, iPhoto, iTunes in feel and scope than it is to FileMaker. But prolonged use for this review has revealed that Bento can easily be made to do more than might be apparent even from glancing familiarity with the delightful sophistication of the interface.

Given some of the things that Bento can do, there's a remarkably high ratio between effort and result. Whether or not it's for you will depend firstly on whether you have Leopard. Then on your data handling requirements: total size of data set, complexity of relations and perhaps the way (or whether) you use iCal and Address Book. Then you should decide whether one of the absent features (scripting, full control over template fonts, a missing calculation, say) rules it out.

For many users the extremely pleasing appearance of Bento will be a winner. How nice to be able to work in a fully Mac-like environment using an inventory of - car parts.

A balance has been struck: users with complex, evolving and intricately relational databases may still be best with FileMaker Pro. Those for whom the lure of an elegant user interface is important and/or who want a direct equivalent of Numbers, Pages and iPhoto/iTunes and/or seamless integration with iCal and Address Book should look seriously at Bento. Download the trial, use it carefully and draw on the many sources of online help, remember its very reasonable price, decide whether you'll be able to make Bento do a variety of things for you larger than the dedicated software mentioned at the beginning of this review can do - and see!

Pros: the interface - it's good-looking, simple and easy to use; many data types supported; integration with Address Book and iCal; templates work with many types of file; works with iPhone and .Mac

Cons: the interface - the changes you can make to its appearance are somewhat limited; poor relational capabilities; mass updates to records not supported

It is immediately obvious the new Finder is worth the price of admission alone.  Finder windows open and close quickly, there's no annoying pauses and hangs.  File copies are dramatically faster; no more need for power users to use a third party tool or drop into Terminal to copy files quickly.  Time Machine backups are indeed faster, my old applications still work fine.

So I see no reason not to upgrade:  The speed improvements, the painless installation, and most significantly, the much-improved Finder make this a bargain of an upgrade.

However, when he leaves for college that won't be an option for him.  I wanted something that was easy to use and didn't bog his laptop down.  Unfortunately, although OneCare is a good product, it just didn't fit the bill.

First off, let me say the product has a lot of nice features -- including automated backups, firewall, anti-virus and more rolled into one thing.  However, as I've learned in the past, sometimes rolling too many features into a product can give you a less than stellar offering.  It's hard to be the ""best"" in every category -- and I think this is where OneCare suffers.

I found the Firewall to be terribly annoying.  I prefer to leave software-based firewalls turned OFF because hardware-based firewalls are much more reliable.  When I did this I got not one, but two red icons in my task area on Windows XP that would not go away.  Unlike the built-in firewall with Windows XP/Vista, turning OneCare's firewall off does not give you the option to ignore the condition and remove the red icons.  In this way I felt the program was way too demanding to be wanting to do everything when all I wanted was a subset of its features.

Next, I noticed that the backup feature of OneCare and the backup feature of Windows Home Server was not integrating correctly.  The product states that it ""recognizes"" the backup feature of WHS, but I found out that two backups were trying to occur every night.  I searched around some and couldn't find any real documentation or options for fixing the problem.

The anti-virus feature worked well, and in fact seemed to run just a bit faster than my current anti-virus program, Avast.  Updates happened automatically and it was pretty much non-intrusive.  No complaints there.

There were other features that would be handy for novice users, such as cleaning up the temporary files that Windows and IE seem to leave around as well as a feature to scan your system for missed updates, etc.  Again, these are features a novice user might enjoy so they don't have to manage their computer as much.

However, my overall impression was that OneCare is ""good"" but just doesn't make it into the ""great"" category.  I'd say if you have one or two PC's without a home network then this program will work for you just fine.  If you are a more tech-savy computer user then you'll probably find yourself fighting the program more than getting a lot of value out of it.","Good, but not great...",1214870400,,

Norton was easy to install and is intuitive to use. The main screen is setup to be aesthetically pleasing, with a series of bubbles that you can choose from to drill down to more advanced functions. Unlike other virus programs I have used in the past, it does not become intrusive, causing windows to pop up during routine browsing or software installation. Advanced users will want to make use of the customization, in order to remain protected, yet keep Norton from overstepping its bounds. Norton can take care of threats on its own, or it can be set to ask the user what to do when a security risk is found.

One of the most useful features of 360 is that it can be used to easily set up a backup system. Backing up is an important task that many users overlook, so having an automatic tool takes all the thought out of the process. Norton will help you select which files you want to back up (pictures, video, financial files, documents), how big those files are, how often you want to back up, and the destination of the backup system.

One year I ran by taxes with BOTH H&R Block and Turbo Tax, and both came up with the same answer.  The issue is not with the program's math, but the way that it asks us to answer the questions, the amount of examples to help us decide what all to include in a number, or if a certain situation applies to us or not.  Again this year, 2009, I waited until the prices came down at least 10 bucks under their usual advertised price.  Generally, you should not file until after Feb 1st as the financial companies have through January to get their forms to you.  And, it's not unusual for the tax preparation companies to have online updates well into February, and if those tweaks applied to you, you'd want them before filing.

Each year, the Federal forms go pretty well, but the State of Wisconsin's forms are lacking in the H&R versions. On several occasions, H&R's program did not handle situations that applied to me, and they tell me, this form is not supported, and here's the link to get the paper form and then I have to file paper, not electronically.  This year, the WI AMT form was not supported.  Sad.  It's not that I really want to pay the AMT tax, but if I have to, at least make it easy for me to do that!  The WI AMT form is a hard one to understand, so this would have really been a good one for H&R Block to have automated.  Maybe next year.

So why do I keep using H&R Block?  They are always 5-10 bucks less, and from what I have seen or heard, the Turbo Tax version is not that much better when it comes to the State forms.

Ive used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that Ive had to purchase much more expensive editions of the product to handle all the forms, and Ive generally paid extra for the audit defense guarantee.

This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product.

First, in some situations Intuit won't let you retrieve and print prior years returns unless youve paid for the current years product. I cant remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is don't just save your tax return in Intuits file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records.

The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I couldn't file because a particular form wasn't ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but E-File on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for E-File, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark DO NOT FILE - FORM NOT FINAL even though its supposed to be available. I tried checking for updates and reinstalling as suggested but no luck. I was finally able to find a telephone number for customer service and speak to someone there after a 20-minute hold, only to be told they had no information other than what I knew from searching the forums, and no process for escalating my call to anyone who could help or even give me an updated ETA. I was promised a full refund for the software but have had to start all over on preparing my taxes and several weeks have gone by in which I could have already filed my return.

Intuit makes it hard to speak to anyone in the first place, and harder still to find anyone who can help you with your problems.

TurboTax downloaded another one for me, but I couldn't transfer the tax data I had already filled out, and I couldn't import it to their online returns since it was 2008 data.  TurboTax said I would have to buy another version and do the sixth tax return all over on another computer.  I couldn't use my free MD state download or my paid Missouri state download since I had to do it on another computer.

So I purchased this one just to do one tax return and discovered that downloading one state cost $39.99.  Since I had already printed out the Missouri state return from my computer, I skimped and only downloaded MD state return and will paper file the Missouri one.

Also, since there are five people in my home (only 2 returns as yet though) and friends asked me to do their return, TurboTax should have flexibility so that if you exceed the five limit, you can reload more and not have to pay all over again for another software package, another 2nd state download etc.  I am going to suggest this to them for next year.",WARNING!  this version charged $39.99 for MD state download,1238112000,2,

Furthermore, Symantec has a nice trick to force you to buy new versions of NIS every few years; it cuts off your ability to download virus updates for older ones.

If you want a program with a flashy installation screen, transparent splash screens, 2.3GB of hard drive space taken up and a whopping 32,443 items added to your registry then this is your program.  It's no wonder the system requirements are so steep.  As a CD and DVD burner, I see little difference between this and the many other programs out there (including freeware).  Its DVD player is fine, but frankly I already have one.  The video studio has no real outstanding features that are better than any other cut and paste video program except maybe the ability to add soundtracks and voiceovers.  It's almost embarrassing to have only four different animated titles available and the fourth can't possibly be used for anything other than baby photos.  Seriously, four only?

Help is only located online and the instructions they give are very simplistic with a very small index.  I don't see a link to where you can ask questions either.  It's not really a studio, just four different programs.  This becomes evident when the icons appear on your desktop along with a gadget to open the programs just in case you weren't smart enough to double-click the icons.  Of course you were never asked permission during installation.  Corel also reassigns all the media files (movies, music, and photos) you used to play on Windows Media Player, your photo viewer or whatever you were using to Corel's programs without your permission too!  I call all this stuff vomitware.  Wake up Corel!

Out of all of the programs I used, the only one I found useful was the photo-editing program. The blemish removal and the suntan tool are useful, although the fake suntan could get red and blotchy if not used properly.  The red eye tool is supposed to work on pets too but I didn't find this to be the case.  The straighten tool seemed to chop up the photo more than straighten it.  The fine tune tool (aka the quick fix) brightened up pictures and made some of the old black and white photos I was restoring look really nice.  Strangely it made color photos look too bright and a little over saturated.  In short, it's fun for beginners to play around with but it's certainly not professional quality.  You get a whopping six edges and seventeen frames for your photos in this program.  It's basic, but it is easy to learn and it may save you time over competing photo editors.

- the software installed without problem on my Windows Vista 64 laptop,
- the GPS dongle works as intended, but must be outside to get lock on satellites (as expected)
- trip plotting is reasonably efficient, but not perfect (I'd like to see an option that minimizes changing freeways as long as it does not add more than a few miles to the overall trip distance, that would be really useful in packed urban areas like Los Angeles with numerous interchanges)

Over the past few years I have been getting more and more frustrated with Norton. While using an older version can normally save
you a lot of money, in this case, IT DOES NOT, and adds a lot of frustration with norton coming in and trying to load a new version (and charge you), even when you have over 300 days to go on the one you are using. Also the process of loading the required updates to bring the 2013 or 2014 version to present day, can be daunting, and my last bout with this process was the last straw, as it got stuck on 11 of 14, and would not go any further no matter how many times I un-installed, and re-installed the software.

At this point (after using Norton for over 40 years), my recommendation, is to steer clear of it, as there are now many, many other choices out there, and after selling Norton to Symantec in 1990, the company went straight down hill, as far as I am concerned.",Look somewhere else.,1486684800,,
7869,7869,1.0,False,"10 18, 2013",A1XZIN7RH74JWR,B00EDSI7QO,,Computer Tech,"If you have Windows 7 or XP, you can buy Windows 8.1 Pro (look for the Windows 8 Pro upgrade if you already own XP or Windows 7 - it's much cheaper - you can update it to Windows 8.1 for free).  Microsoft decided to no longer include Windows Media Center as part of Windows 8.  So if you buy this and decide that you want to have a home entertainment pc, you would have to buy the Windows Pro Pack for 99 bucks just to get Windows Media Center.  If you buy Windows 8.1 Pro, you can get Windows Media Center for 10 bucks extra.

If you already have a version of Windows 7, you would be better off to simply install it on your computer rather than this.  If you are updating from Windows XP, I recommend that you find a Windows 7 Upgrade package rather than install Windows 8.1 on your computer. Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 upgrades (because they were out-selling Windows 8), so you may have to buy a Windows 7 OEM version to do a clean install of Windows 7 on your computer.  Windows 7 comes with Windows Media Center as part of the operating system and has an interface well suited for use on a standard non-touch screen computer.

With Windows 8.1, you now get a start button, but the start menu is still not back.  Even more important than the lack of a start menu, you can either have the tiles or an awkward stripped-down desktop choice.  Microsoft still has not realized that a computer is most productive with an operating system designed for a mouse and keyboard interface and that a tablet and a phone come with a touch screen and work best with a touch interface.  The all in one approach will make some power users and early adapters happy, but an every day user who just wants to run multiple applications in actual windows (instead of awkward full-screen apps), including MS Office, email, and dozens of other programs will be much happier with Windows 7.

Windows 8.1 is a bit friendlier than Windows 8, but it is still an operating system that gives the user an awkward desktop interface instead of a classic start menu and takes away the valuable feature of Windows Media Center only to charge you an additional 99 dollars to get it back by buying Windows 8 Pro Pack.

UPDATED INFORMATION: Below are quotes from a CNET review of Windows 8.1 concerning the tiles, the start button and the classic Windows 7 interface as well as their observation about Windows 7 vs Windows 8.1:

""The split between the touch-friendly tiles and throwback desktop mode is still awkward, and the OS is hard to use without a touch screen. While welcome, the new Start button doesn't behave like the classic version...""

""What you're left with is an OS that still feels like an awkward compromise between the traditional ""desktop"" Windows and the touch-centric, tablet-optimized future that looks and feels exactly like Windows Phone.""

""If you have a legacy Windows 7 system and haven't taken the Windows 8 plunge yet, there's still no reason to.""

Full review is at [...]

If Microsoft were to restore the option for the classic start menu and include Windows Media Center as part of the operating system, I would be inclined to recommend Windows 8.1 as an operating system that I would use.  However, in its current state, I must agree with CNET that if you have a legacy Windows 7 system and haven't taken the Windows 8 plunge yet, there is still no compelling reason to do so based on the changes in Windows 8.1.

UPDATE December 3, 2013:  As of November 30th, here is the breakdown of Microsoft operating systems in use:

*Windows 7  46.64 percent of pc's
*Windows XP  31.22 percent of pc's
*Windows 8  6.66 percent of pc's
*Windows Vista  3.57 percent of pc's
*Windows 8.1  2.64 percent of pc's

Windows 8.1 is faster and has some improved security features over Windows 7. However, as you can see, even Windows Vista has a larger installed share of the market than Windows 8.1 as of November 30, 2013.  Windows customers are waiting for Microsoft to give them a choice of whether they want to use the tablet (tiled) interface or a fully functioning desktop O/S complete with a start menu as an option.

Although Windows 8.1 made some improvements and I could tolerate it (however awkward it might be), I am staying with Windows 7 because it already includes a friendly desktop with Start Menu and Windows Media Center for recording live tv.  Why should customers lose functionality or incur additional expenses with Windows 8?

The rejection of Windows 8 and 8.1 has gotten so bad that sources say Microsoft is finally talking about bringing back the start menu in Windows 8.2.  See ""Microsoft may finally bring back full Start menu with Windows 8.2""

[...]

Computer manufacturers have become so disgusted with the whole Windows 8 and 8.1 mess that they are now talking about selling computers that run both Windows 8 and Android. (Note: this can't be good news for Microsoft!) See ""PC makers plan rebellion against Windows at 2014 CES, analysts say.""

If Smart Surfing was less expensive (and didn't bring my browsers to a halt), I might like having it as a safety net. But at this price, it just didn't measure up.

The only criticism I can make of this handsomely outfitted program is that it will allow you to import photos in JEPG, TIFF and RAW but not PNG.

Many of my images are big because they eventually go on tee shirts or posters but need to be uploaded to my company in condensed form.

In a single package you can organize your photos, adjust, edit and share. The editors say PhotoDirector exceeds the capabilities of PhotoShop Lightroom.

The five PhotoDirector Modules appear at the top of your canvas.

Library- where your imported photos will be stored. While in the library your images can be sorted by tagging them, plunking them into a smart collection, album or folder.

Adjustments- this is a fine playpen where you can whip your photo into shape and plug and play. Instant views of your adjustments can be seen by running your mouse over the thumbnails of imported Images at the bottom of your canvas. All of the adjustments are on your left. Tones, brightness and subtle tinges, red eye, cropping, the application of presets and literally hundreds of face lifts can be applied to your photos. Sliders can be manipulated to zero in on exactly the effect that you want. An HDR (high dynamic range) selection allows you to apply brilliant color to an image.

Edit- here you apply makeover tools to your portraits. Zapping wrinkles, smoothing skin, re-shaping an out of shape bod will make you popular with your friends whose pictures you manipulate. The Eye Blinger lets you brighten eyes, darken lashes and eyebrows and much more via special brushes. Watermarks can also be applied from this module and are created here, too.

Slideshow- Slideshows are created here and can be accompanied by music and exported to UTube if you wish. The booklet that is included with PhotoDirector  explains how to do this. All of the modules are covered in this Users Guide and explained with easy to follow directions.

Print- here you can customize the layout, and the way images are displayed and more by zooming, rotating and other maneuvers.

Easy to set parental controls. I really  like the Family Protection, which unlike the other one I used, can not simply be worked around by being uninstalled or using another browser.
I also like the little green check that shows up next to URLs, especially tinyurls, this has made it much easier for me as I now can tell my kids that if it has a green check, they can go there.  I had banned them from tinyurls since they can hid bad stuff.

Tracking device is really neat, now I know who swiped my netbook!

You can find a data sheet on the website with all the information about what you can do with each device (search Macafee All Acccess Datasheet) , for example you can mobile lock a smartphone or tablet but not a laptop.  You also cannot monitor IM on a tablet but you can on a laptop...

Bad:
Does not play well with all of Apple.  I really wish it would, finding the missing Ipod or Ipad in the house alone would be worth it.

Unknown:
No cd, just an install code.  Not sure what happened if you need to reinstall.

Annoying:
Don't call yourself green because you did not print a manual and printed the code on recycled paper.  You put that little piece of paper in a box, then it goes in another box to be shipped when it could easily been provided via email.  After all, you are making us download it!

I've used McAfee for years.  I especially like the Quick Clean feature that cleans up my computer's unnecessary temporary files along with clearing the cache and history and other things that take up space and can slow down a computer.

I was hesitant this time when I bought it though, because it was for a download with a subscription code card number.  I've always used a CD for the install in prior years.  When I recently bought a new laptop, I separately bought an external disc drive since my laptop doesn't contain one.  Who knew that things I used to install via a CD are pretty much now only offered as downloads, online.  This is one of those things.  I was nervous trying a new way to install my McAfee Internet Security but I worried needlessly.  It was quite easy and I didn't run into any problems whatsoever.  The product works as it should and like I expected it to.

I do want to mention that I think some people said if you already have a subscription to McAfee, when you install a new version, it extends your subscription for another year from the end date of your old subscription.  I didn't find that to be true.  My previous subscription, that came with my new laptop, was due to run out on (not sure of the date now), let's say, 3/26.  I installed the new subscription on 3/24/2014.  It didn't extend my subscription to 3/26/2015.  Instead, it subscribed me from the date of installation, 3/24 for one year, to 3/24/2015.  So, if you still have a week or two left on your current subscription, I would advise not installing the new one before then.  It's not the worst thing in the world but, it appears you will then lose that week or two that were still remaining on your old subscription.

I do not find that my computer slows down at all on my new laptop.  On my much older PC that runs Vista, there is a noticeable slow down when McAfee is scanning of updating while I'm using the computer.  But, that computer is slow even when nothing is happening to interfere with its performance so I guess Anything that's running in the background would make it operate even slower.  On my laptop that runs Windows 8.1, I find no problem whatsoever.  I've been warned, over the years, not to open certain links or websites and because of McAfee, I've never had a virus, thank goodness.",IT'S MY CHOICE EVERY TIME ......,1397174400,6,

It will completely restore your operating system, programs & files to the time and date that you last saved an image of your drive with Acronis. If you have a software failure, Acronis can have your system up in running in minutes. If you have a hard drive failure, you need to find another similar hard drive and then in minutes you can again have a working system. Acronis 11 performs other tasks but this review only addresses one critical issue: full system image backups.

The downside of the program is that the menus are not intuitive and can be confusing and at first, a bit frustrating. You absolutely must create & test the Acronis recovery disk to be sure it works and that this recovery disk and your computer will read the hard drive on which you have saved a disk image. You absolutely must validate each disk image you create and then mount it to test that the saved image files are readable. And you must save complete or updated hard drive images frequently, I do it monthly, so you have the data you need is saved in case you need it.

If your system fails and your saved image is 6 months old, you have lost 6 months of data unless you have saved it on some other restorable media.

If you do the musts listed above, you can breath easy and be confident that all will be well with your software treasure if you system fails.

My youngest daughter was in a ballet recital but a few days before the recital she fell and cut open her head.  That left a nasty wound that the ballet instructor asked us to cover with a minimal band aid.  Needless to say, we could not find a band aid so we tried to brush her hair to the side to cover.  It worked a little but in all the pictures this larger than life cut showed up very prominent.

It just so happened that the software arrived the day before so I loaded it onto my MacBook Pro and without reading through the instructions started playing with the program to see what it could do.

After two bad starts I figured out which aspect of the program fixed images and wiped away blemishes and such.  In about 5 minutes I had figured out how to remove the wound from the image and place exact skin tone right over the spot.  I touched it up with a brush feature and then went about brightening their eyes and whitening their teeth, both of which were very easy to figure out without using the guide.

The final product was fantastic and my wife an I can't be more pleased and out daughter loved looking at her image without the cut.  For a program to load, be up and running and finish in less than 30 minutes is wonderful.  The smart patch is what I used along with the eye fix and teeth whitening.

It seemed more stable then the previous antivirus programs I've used, so I went ahead and updated it to Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 after about two weeks of use. Worked the same for a while until I started really noticing the difference between these programs and my last antivirus program, Spyware Doctor.

When I first installed Bitdefender Antivirus 2010, it found a couple of problems that Spyware Doctor didn't. However, since then it's found almost nothing, which is strange... when I used Spyware Doctor, I would scan every night and find four or five minor problems (tracking cookies, etc) over the course of a week. This program hasn't found anything in the last two months. I finally reinstalled Spyware Doctor and came up with several minor security risks that Bitdefender ignored. My definitions are automatically updated, so that isn't the problem.

After about a month of using it, I began having strange problems. First, Bitdefender's firewall suddenly began causing problems with programs that were normally allowed to access the internet. I tried removing them from the exceptions list then re-adding them, but nothing worked. I finally gave up and disabled Bitdefender's firewall and everything worked fine again. I emailed their support, but never received a response.

Second, around the same time I began having computer lockups... my computer would stop responding and run EXTREMELY slow. At the same time, the Bitdefender icon in the taskbar would turn grey with the message telling me that Bitdefender encountered a problem and I need to restart the computer. It usually cleared itself up within a few minutes, but would reoccur randomly. Sometimes it would go several days, other times it would happen two to three times in a single evening. I finally had to shut down the real-time monitoring, which seems to have cured this problem.

Well, after shutting down the process scanning and the firewall, and not being happy with the daily system scanning, what's left?

In the past, if I wanted to resize a partition, it was a complicated process, first backing up all data on the drive, then using disk utility to reformat and then partition the drive, and finally copying my data to the new partitions.  With Leopard, all that is consolidated into one step.  In disk utility, I can select the ""partition"" option, drag the size of my existing partition to release space on the drive (or type in a number to specify exactly how big I want the partition to be!)  Then create a new partition or partitions in the empty space - No loss of data, no reformatting, dead simple.  This is a powerful feature, which used to require third party software to accomplish.

Like a lot of people, it was very frustrating at first to know how to do anything until I discovered this was just a shell built over Windows 7.  In fact, you can escape the top layer shell with a single click.  What I really like most is the Netflix App (the trendy name now).  So easy to watch multi-chapter movies now.

Boot up is astonishingly fast - less than 15 seconds with an old Intel 80 GB SSD from a full power off state with a low cost HP desktop computer with an AMD processor.  I've never witnessed anything like this speed previously, probably three times faster than Windows 7.  I have multiple other computers in my house, but the one I have dedicated to my HDTV was well worth upgrading to Windows 8.  I am not in a rush to upgrade the others yet, especially since I know it is still Windows 7 under the outer shell.  But am I glad I upgraded the computer that is my connection to my television and the internet.  I only paid $15 directly to Microsoft for the upgrade.  But I got too cautious and didn't buy any more upgrades because I didn't like it at first.

It takes a week or so to get the hang of these boxes across your screen.  I wish they allowed the old familiar icons instead of the boxes.  Now it is just boxes and text inside - not very appealing.  Seems retro to the 1980s, not a leap forward.  But it still works.  You have to do a Google search to learn how to do anything even basic.  This is a start over as far as the outer shell is concerned.  But you can easily drop down below the outer shell and you are right back to the Windows 7 look and feel.  Well, the Control Panel is really different.  I don't much like the new way either, but it is still there more or less.  I think they are copying the Apple Tablet style where there are zillions of individuals creating Apps and charging money.  I am not one to pay for the apps.  So far I can find all the things I want for free.

Other than the fast boot speed and the all the boxes on your monitor, it is still pretty much like Windows 7 underneath.  One minor annoyance.  You have to pay $10 to get the Windows Media Player that was free in Windows 7.  You can't play a DVD without it.  Well, you can - just not so easy.

Story-Bess and George have arranged for you to vacation with one of George's friends, in a place called Snake Horse Harbor.  She owns a whale watching tour business, and when you arrive you find out that someone has vandalized her boat.  She sets to work repairing it as you question suspects to find out that a whale recently spotted in the water might be what has driven someone to wrecking Katie's boat.

Graphics-In this game, they were a little hazy, but that works perfectly with the story, as the island you are on is foggy year round.  The characters were pretty much the same as the last game.

Sound-The music is not that upbeat.  It's rather lazy music.  Pretty much makes you think you can just take your time with this mystery.  And you can.  Although you can die, it's usually from stupidity on your part and not because someone attacked you or something.

Gameplay-The third person point-and-click hasn't changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you don't have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.

Fun-Other than that, the game's puzzles are really quite fun in spite of their difficulty.  The mystery is fun, too, as everyone has a motive to have vandalized Katie's boat.

Length-The game lasted me a few weeks, but I think playing it straight through takes about 10 hours.

Intuit seems to follow a 90/10 principle with 90% of their budget going to graphic designers endlessly rehashing the aesthetics of the software and 10% for making meaningful improvements.

Another major complaint I have with Intuit is that they leverage ads into their software. Quicken will encourage you to bank with Chase, open mortgages through QuickenLoans, etc. I pay full price for software so that I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT ADS. Intuit force feeds them to you. Simply unacceptable in my opinion when paying full price for a piece of software.

If you are coming to Quicken fresh, don't hesitate to purchase a copy. It is a viable financial management software that despite its quirks and frustrations, largely does a find job of managing MOST people's money. If you've already got a copy of Quicken that you're happy with KEEP IT. Upgrade only when absolutely necessary (when the ability to automatically download transactions from your bank expires).

The bottom line is that every year Quicken messes about with the layout of the GUI (Graphic User Interface). Some changes you may like, others you may not. I've found they do about much harm as good. They have done a few things to make the software a bit more user friendly and customizable, but there are still glaring gaps that haven't been addressed for many years. If you check the Intuit user forums you can see what I'm talking about.

A few examples:

1) Quicken cannot track 401k loans, even if you have direct update set up with your brokerage. It creates a constant cash balance issue that is impossible to sort out.

2) Mortgage balance tracking is cumbersome at best.

3) Partial ownership of assets is virtually impossible (for example if you are part owner of a rental property and want to track your cost basis--you must manually adjust everything to your ownership percentage and then enter it)

Admittedly these examples will not apply to most users. However, when product as the word PREMIER in it's title, and costs nearly a hundred bucks, I think it's fair to expect it to have accommodate sophisticated financial situations.

Another issue I have with Quicken is that it REGULARLY crashes after completing a one-step update. I have to go into task manager and manually kill the QB.exe program and then restart to get things working again. The error report that QBs generates is meaningless, and no one at Intuit is capable of diagnosing it. They blame the error on my computer (laughable considering I run a host of other far more demanding programs flawlessly) and suggest re-installing, something I've tried multiple times with no success. Their customer support is terrible. Be prepared to be told it is your computer at issue or run in circles through their e-maul support. As a person with a high level of tech experience, I can tell you these guys really are clueless.

In summary:

They offer full function version for 30-day trial. Corel has a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, but that is for purchase made directly from them only. So, try before you buy.

Currently, I am using ScanSoft's paperport software for following manipulations:
(1) To combing multiple documents into a single PDF file. Or remove/extract pages from a multi-page PDF file.
(2) Rotate page(s) of PDF files.

My intention of using Corel Fusion is to convert PDF files into editable documents.

The Goods:
(a) Easy to install and does an excellent job of converting documents to PDF files. The software allows me to open multiple PDFs, drag and drop certain pages among them, and then recombine them. The drag-and-drop assembly feature is excellent and easy to use.
(b) I don't have to go through the trouble of opening up a file. I can simply drag the file or document into the program.
(c) I can convert a batch of files into PDF instead of doing it one by one.

The Annoying:
(a) It does NOT come with any owners manual, not even on the installation disk!
(b) The speed of file saving is slow. Also, the editing speed is slow. My PC has Intel iCore-7 with 12G memory.
(c) Corel Fusion can only convert PDF documents into Word or SpreadSheet.
(d) Don't try to fill in a PDF blank form with Fusion, as this is not a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get program. Forms that appear fine on the screen will not print out correctly.
(e) Corel Fusion uses heavy compression with no user control on the image quality. Be careful if you intend to include graphics or pictures in your PDF files.

The Bads:
(a) It does convert PDF file into Word document. But tables doesn't work and bullets has problems. All the text is there, but the formatting is gone.
(b) It does not allow you to click on a text filed to edit it. To cut and paste text objects, you'd better do it in Word, not in Corel Fusion.
(c) Corel Fusion provides comment boxes with large border for me to add comments, paragraph, or a signature. However, it's extremely difficult to neatly position the comment boxes in the document.

All in all, at this bargain price, Corel PDF Fusion is a good choice for people want to combine pages into a PDF file, extract pages from PDF files, or rotate pages in a PDF file.

4290,4290,5.0,True,"10 23, 2009",A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,B002DHLUWK,,Wilder K. Raven,"I was a Mac user until I used Windows 7.

I've owned several Macs running OS X, including the late 2008 aluminum MacBook. Thanks to Boot Camp, I was able to run Windows on my Mac, and when the opportunity to try the Windows 7 Release Candidate came up, I decided to use my Boot Camp partition for just that.

It ran great. I was impressed. After a few months, I found myself spending more time in the Windows 7 partition than in the OS X partition. I finally decided to swap around my partition sizes, and gave Windows 7 the larger chunk of my hard drive, while OS X was re-installed fresh and left unused on a tiny partition. I didn't miss OS X, which is interesting because I've spent many years defending OS X, and countering PC users when they bashed Macs. Still, I was a Mac user. I had Mac hardware. I was certain it was a good value anyway.

Some online friends proved me wrong on that count, too. They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too. I couldn't deny it: I was clinging to my Mac out of brand loyalty, and with Windows 7 on the horizon (and the RC working so well) I could see no reason why I shouldn't switch to PC.

So I did. I sold my aluminum MacBook and picked up an ASUS gaming PC. I removed Windows Vista from the ASUS and installed the Windows 7 RC as my primary operating system, and was pretty happy with it. It ran smoothly and without incident for many months while I waited for the retail release of Windows 7.

Just yesterday I got my copy of Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade, and I have to say that installation went well. I was up & running in less than an hour, and had my previous Windows Backup restored to my new OS within another 40 minutes. I did have to spend a little time re-downloading some things like Firefox and Thunderbird, but those things are to be expected with a fresh install. The cool thing is that Windows 7 remembered that the RC I was running was an ""upgrade"" from a legitimate Windows Vista installation, and so I wasn't bugged, prompted, or tasked with proving my ownership of Vista. It just *knew* and went ahead with the installation.

Once installed, activation was simple and took a few seconds online. You need not fear MS activation now, as they're a lot less touchy than they were when Windows XP first showed up.

So what do I like about Windows 7? On a really basic level, I like that I can play Direct X games, where the Mac was a little short in the gaming department. But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment. Sidebar gadgets are nice, too. Windows also did a good job ripping off the ""Sticky Notes"" application from the Mac, and I use that quite a bit.

The big negative for most people in switching to Windows 7 will be the lack of an email client. For me it's no big deal because I use Mozilla Thunderbird (free and open-source). For people used to Windows Mail or Outlook Express, you'll either have to switch clients, or make a purchase.

Best of all, Windows 7 is not a resource hog. I gained a lot of performance going from Vista (the original OS in my ASUS laptop) to Windows 7 RC, and the retail release is no different. Things work better, and Windows 7 takes advantage of my 4GB of RAM. It helps to be running 64-bit, though. It's a good thing Microsoft included both 64-bit and 32-bit DVDs in the case. No mail-in upgrades, here!

If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that. After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC.",Good Enough to Switch from Mac to PC,1256256000,41,

Please make your decision based on a review from someone who has actually used the product.  I can't imagine putting a review on a product when I haven't actually used it.

I agree that this is expensive, but as an individual and not a business/professional, I know that this product was not meant for me.  This is Office Professional - it has a LOT of features.  It is not designed for users who are mainly going to only use Word and Excel.  That is what some of the other versions are for.  If you don't need Access or Publisher or Outlook, then yes, this would be really overpriced.  I'm not going to complain about the price of the Adobe Creative Suite when the only thing I'm going to do is remove red eye and crop photos.  This software is designed for businesses and institutions.

The previous reviewer (Surgery 100 ""ADJ"") has done an excellent job of reviewing and covering the new features.  Also, I suggest checking out the related media videos on the product page.

The biggest addition is the ability to link and share information via the web.  You can link docs, notes, spreadsheets, share presentations via the web.  Lots of capabilities to share and collaborate.

I love using OneNote.  I use it for a lot of things and I think it is possibly the most underutilized program in the suite.  People may think it is for taking notes in class.  I'm not a student - it can be really helpful for organizing lots of different types of information.  Now I can share my notebooks via the web, a feature that CAN be really helpful for students and non-students alike.

A couple of features I like is the people pane on Outlook integrated with the Outlook Social Connector.  This allows me to link my contacts to social networks (facebook, LinkedIn) and display information from the social network on the people pane.  So, when I open an email from someone who has a fb profile, I can see all their posted items, previous emails, facebook statuses.

I also really like the customizable ribbons, though I'm still working on how to get them best customized to meet my needs.  The great thing is that I can.

Overall, there are some ""neato"" features and the ability to share online can be very helpful.

So I have quite a bit of experience with the operating system.  Let's get to the nitty gritty:

Should you upgrade from Windows Vista?  YES!  I mean it - upgrade today.
Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use.  Even the preproduction version of Windows 7 was better than my Vista with SP2.

Should you upgrade from Windows XP? Maybe, but for different reasons.
XP is a good operating system and if you don't need to add new hardware or software, XP is good.  However, XP is old as an operating system.  Also chances are that if you're running XP, you might not meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 - check the compatibility site at Microsoft to see if your system will support Windows 7.  That said, Windows 7 is light years ahead of Windows XP in terms of functionality, ease of use, etc - to me it's worth buying a new system.

64 bit or 32 bit?
If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's ok skip this section.  If you have a core2 duo or core 2 quad or a multi cpu machine, go with the 64 bit OS, it handles memory and the CPUs much better.  If you have a single core CPU, one CPU or run special programs that require 32bit, then stick with 32 bit for now.

BEFORE INSTALLATION:
I recommend you have:
-a core 2 duo or core 2 quad machine
-4gig of RAM (That's about $50 in today's market)
-good hard drive with (200 gig - it doesn't need that much but that's another $50)
-back up your files to a USB drive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Digital-My-Passport-Essential-500-GB-USB-2-0-Portable-External-Hard-Drive-WDME5000TN-Midnight-Black/dp/B001F9LY14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive WDME5000TN (Midnight Black)</a>
-check to make sure your computer is compatible with Windows 7

INSTALLATION:
Installation was very straight forward.  You put in the CD and reboot your machine.  You might have to enter your bios and enable the ""boot from CD"" option.  Once the machine reboots a nice screen comes up to guide you through the installation.  You have the option to upgrade your PC or do a clean installation.  I did an upgrade and it brought in all of my files and settings from my windows Vista system.  It worked great.
The upgrade did take about 2 hours for me so definitely consider.
I noticed that early on in the installation the operating system went out to Microsoft's site to look for the latest and greatest updates, so I think this should  help Microsoft respond quickly to any hiccups with compatibility.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
The driver from my old HP Inkjet printer for 2001 doesn't work on Windows 7 so there are some things that will not transition.  I had to use a generic HP driver which doesn't give me the quality that I got from an injet - so overall, I'm up and running with that printer but I'm degraded on the inkjet front.  That said, I recently upgraded to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-CP2025DN-Color-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B001F0RI1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP CP2025DN Color LaserJet Printer</a>&nbsp;that I love so no real loss there.  I'll likely pick up a cheap inkjet for the occasional photo that I might need to print.  Everything else upgraded.

BENEFITS
-faster boot time
-faster go to sleep
-faster wakeup
-faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista - seriously (but those are my results without any benchmarks or anything like that, just seeing how fast Adobe Illustrator loads, and how fast all the applications respond)
-joining wireless networks is much easier
-the interface is just plain beautiful
-my wallpapers are now a slideshow that can be set to change every few minutes (I'm not stuck with the same picture)
-Gadgets - these are wonderful little small applications that you can drag onto your desktop.  I have a weather gadget and a calendar gadget on my desktop that tell me
-Better taskbar management - hovering over the taskbar icons shows me mini windows of what's running
-Better file management - I can organize my files into Libraries that are sortable not only by type but by folder or other data.  It's great!  I can browse through my presentations or illustrator files!
-Windows Media appears to be smoother which I love.
-You get some virus protection and firewall with Windows 7 but consider something more comprehensive like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Total-Protection-3User-2010/dp/B002GUUO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Total Protection 3User 2010</a>. Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but

CONS:
- Some older programs might not work and some drivers might not be available like my inkjet driver.
- Other than that, there aren't too many drawbacks to Windows 7 - it's a great OS.

WHICH VERSION SHOULD I GET?

If you're a home user that doesn't do a lot of networking, you might consider just the home premium edition.  If you're using a laptop and connect to networks at work, you might want the Professional version of the operating system to help you with domain joining.

I used this device to plan a family trip to Niagara Falls, which I figured would be a good test as we had never been there before and we wanted to know about as many family-friendly things as possible and find a quick and safe route to and from there. We also have a Magellan 3000 and have used it for trips to places we have never been to. I have also had a good bit of experience working with in-vehicle mobile data systems.

Now the de-bunking:
Depending on which product description you read, you might come across the statement: ""NEW-compact, cable-free GPS Locator."" Which might lead you to believe that said device connects wirelessly to your PC, which it does NOT. It has a USB GPS receiver that is not wireless. You may have difficulty placing your laptop in a safe location that is also able to receive the GPS satellite broadcasts, so you might need to use a cable to place it where it will pick up the satellite broadcasts.  The length of the included cable is very short, I would suggest you get a three foot USB extension cable (male to female -- NOT the kind you would use for a printer) and use that instead. In addition to that, you will want to put it some where that the screen will be visible / out of direct sunlight, usually, if you intend to glance at it during en-route navigation. You might also need a screen shade if sunlight is a problem. Another thing that might be distracting is the flashing `Microsoft' on the receiver.
 [Also, when I say safe, you need to be able to attach you laptop to something that will hold it securely in case you have a crash and the airbags deploy and to prevent the laptop from slamming into your body.]

If you want to use it in your vehicle for extended periods, you will ALSO need a power supply for your laptop, which would be a DC to AC inverter for your regular power supply / battery charger or a DC to DC adapter so you can do without your power brick. Having the inverter may be a more versatile, but have the other one might be a little more efficient.

There is value in having a bigger screen, as long as it is not distracting while you are trying to drive.
The GPS receiver worked well, and fast, even inside my house, which has a very wide overhanging roof.
 It seems to be able to search for and update construction information (which most cheaper, stand-alone units cannot) as long as you do that while online.

I think the real value of it is the planning side of things. It does not seem to have more data than the Magellan GPS we have, but it would be easier to update the software and data than with a stand-alone unit. I would like to be able to search for places we like along the way by name (like Cracker Barrel, for instance).

It seems to me like it would be useful if you are making sales calls and need to update where you are going once or twice a day.
It nags you that you are off route frequently if you are going slowly and changing lanes on a multi-lane roadway, so that can become annoying.
It is helpful to be able to print out the maps so you can become familiar with the route. Be sure to have your computer online BEFORE you install it, just in case you need a component that you do not already have installed.

All in all, I think this is a good tool for route planning, but it may not a safe or easy option for you to use for navigation.",READ THIS FIRST!,1245628800,11,

Layout is clear & encourages imaginative use. Despite its intuitive nature, you will need some experience with video editing technique and technology in general.

Pinnacle Studio 18 is a PC video editor's dream because first, it is not absurdly expensive especially when you consider all the options it comes with. Secondly, if you're familiar with general video editing, the toolset is very accessible. It is easy to splice, cut, trim and so on, all the usual capabilities. The Plus version comes with 3D support (count me out). The flow of an editing project is reflected in the design decision to have three prominent tabs at the top reflecting the modes: Organize, Edit, and Author. Gathering your data is quick and can be automatic. Editing is of course what you'll be doing most of the time and authoring is where you create your output, from creating MP4 files to creating DVDs (take a look at the immense number of file formats supported; and devices, too!)

Managing the editing of the clips is a great feature, it allows you to double-click on it, open up the clip separately and apply effects and transitions just to that clip. I also really like how you can apply transitions by dragging and dropping. It's a very analog process if you get my meaning, which lends itself to the artistry. There's also a tool to apply color corrections, which I've had some hit-and-miss results with. Where Pinnacle 18 really shines is the constant rendering that keeps taking place, sort of a ""run-ahead"" operation that allows you to see what you've created so far if you need to, for frame of reference, etc. That this does not require a separate button push operation is excellent.

I am a huge fan of PaintShop Pro and have been using it for years. So I was curious to see if this might be a replacement to PaintShop Pro (PSP) or a useful addition to it for my needs.  I am not a professional photographer, but I am a bit of an enthusiast. I own several DSLR cameras and quality lenses and have taken some photos that have been used in professional magazines and other professional venues.  But it is a hobby for me and certainly not my day job.

That said, I have become very proficient in Paint Shop Pro and have learned to use layers and I have various different accessories that I use, including color cards, Wacom Intuous digital styluses and more.  I can put a program through its paces.

Let's start off with the basics. This is NOT photoshop. It isn't Paint Shop Pro. It is something else altogether although it does have overlapping functionality with both of those programs.  The simplest way I know of to describe it is a lighter version of Photoshop/PSP, specializing in automation and cataloging.  It is for the professional who may come home from a wedding with several hundred (or thousand, if he/she has apprentices working) photos that need a lot of the same things done to each photo. For example, they all might need the same color correction or white balancing. Or there might be dozens with the same facial blemish that needs to be removed... Anything that needs to be done many times to similar photos is easily done here, and wouldn't be easily done in photoshop or PSP.  Corel purchased a pretty good program called Bibble Pro and has put their team to work on stylizing it more like other Corel products so that it will interact well with them and be relatively easy to use for photographers and editors coming from other Corel products.  Being version 3 of a product that was in version 5 when they acquired it, AfterShot Pro 3 is a mature program with a fair amount of testing and real-world use under its belt.

The program is also very good for cataloging. It will let you assign metadata to your files so that later you can easily find photos with an in-depth search function that makes it easy to find photos with keyword searches, and searches based on location and time and date and more.

Another nice feature is that it is non-destructive. The program makes all of its changes to it's own files, which tell the program what to do to the original raw file - at no time is the original ever changed.  You may end up producing a jpg that is different than the original raw file, but the raw file from the camera will always be kept as it was originally shot from the camera.

I had some learning curves to overcome and a couple of things that bothered me. One of the features of this program is that it is supposed to have a light footprint and run well, even on older computers.  It is also supposed to use the processing power of higher end graphics cards (which I have) to help speed up processing, resulting in a much faster workflow when processing hundreds or thousands of photos.  However, I also found some glitches.  For instance, when making changes to things like white balance or color tone, the screen would give me a very jagged, low quality image that remained that way until I interacted with the photo in some way.  A mouse click or something else would be required to force the proper redraw.  I found this immensely distracting and annoying and I did not readily see a way to fix it.  It doesn't do anything to the picture (everything is non-destructive) but it affects how the picture looks on screen and is annoying.

I also found a problem with easily getting back to the previous setting if I did something that I didn't like. Yes, there is an undo feature, but sometimes you are working within a screen where you haven't committed anything yet (like a white balance dropper) and it is not easy to return to a previous setting that you liked.

Finally, I found some instances where drop down lists would not drop down, even though they should.

I have included a photo of the ""jagged"" effect that I encountered.

Overall, Corel has done a good job of creating an inexpensive alternative to Aperture or Lightroom and it interacts well with PaintShop Pro (AND photoshop, interestingly) so this is arguably a solid choice for photographers looking for an inexpensive but high powered and high quality alternatives to the big guys.","A good, inexpensive alternative to Lightroom and/or Aperture",1465776000,35,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81duL23NvmL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-jL3EGzHL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Zwp6mUZ9L._SY88.jpg']"

I read the reviews of all of those who were saying that they were having major headaches trying to get it to download properly, and install. Then I read the reviews from those who were saying it downloaded and installed without so much as a whimper; it all went smoothly, and only took a few minutes. I noticed that those who reported a no problem install were saying they were installing it into a Vista 64 machine.

I thought the detractors must have been missing a keystroke somewhere, and after all, by downloading I was getting the latest version. The CD that you buy had to be older, and you would need a download anyhow, so why not just download it in the first place? The price was close to the same, by the time you factored in the shipping from the third party vendor. So I bought it and downloaded it into my XP machine. That is when the trouble began. It had problems every step of the way. So I decided to uninstall it and try shutting off my McAfee antivirus, as well as my Scotty the Watchdog Win Patrol that alerts me, with options every time someone tries to install a program on my machine at boot up, eating up valuable resources. Sure enough on the first install, up came the warning, and I said ""Yes"" but it stopped installing anyhow, so I shut it off, rebooted the machine, and on the third attempt, even renames the prior download, so I could download a fresh copy. (I did get a file error message somewhere along the way, so I decided to get a fresh download from the Amazon library) Well after all of that, it still didn't work. Oh it finally worked, and the program came up, after waiting about 3 minutes for it to load, and then when it did load, and I clicked on start a new return, after about 5 minutes, I decided it was frozen, and I did get a few ""Not responding"" messages when I tried to egg it on.

So I went to my other XP machine with a 2.4Mghz CPU instead of the 2.0 machine I initially installed it in, (both had 2 Gigs of ram) and this time I couldn't get it to load. Amazon is very helpful in getting the download part to work, even on a busy Sunday, 2 weeks before the deadline, but getting the Turbo Tax program to work, well that was something else altogether.

So finally I decided to give it a try in my Vista 64 Media Center PC. I downloaded it and in the middle of the download I realized it was being downloaded and installed right in the middle of recording the TV show 60 Minutes. I also had my McAfee Antivirus software running. I decided not to interrupt it. I just let it run. It fully downloaded, and all the usual prompts came up, just like before, just a lot, lot faster this time, and when it was all done, it went online, did the updates, and when I finally clicked on the ""Start a New Return"" button, it instantly flicked over to the next screen. How about that, it worked perfectly. Then I copied last year's return over the Vista PC and it drank that up, and gave me the next screen etc. No matter what I clicked on it worked perfectly. The program was running like a banshee.

So, can we conclude that it works effortlessly on a Vista machine, but it has problems with XP (Wouldn't that be a switch to all those Vista haters out there:)? Or is something in the way I ran it causes me to have 2 failures trying to load it in an XP machine, but not with the Vista?
I had to come back and edit this because with some thought I realized that I had Win Patrol with Scotty the watchdog running on both XP machines, but not on the Vista machine. What Scotty does is stop programs from loading on startup without your approval. So it pauses the load, asks is it ok, then after clicking on Ok it did not resume. So the pause turned into a halt. So if you are running Win Patrol, right click on it on the task bar and choose ""Exit"" before loading Amazon's installer installation. I did manage to work around that, and was able to access the program, but it was running like it had a corrupt file in it. Fortunately Amazon allows you to download and reinstall.

With freestanding GPS units, it's easy to simply ask it to display nearby gas stations, hotels, etc.  However, there's no way to do this easily with S&T.  The only way to get that information is to go to the turn-by-turn list of directions, figure out which step you are near, select THAT, and then request nearby places of interest.  Not only wasn't it intuitive, it was useless to me: I used my G1 and its GPS unit for that functionality most of the time.  One other problem I had was a few software crashes. I was unable to determine if this was bad code or an underpowered netbook - though mine is easily able to run everything else I've thrown at it.

I suppose if you sat in a room and planned your trip, then loaded those trips as you traveled, this would work fine. Alternatively, if you had a navigator with you running the computer, you might be in ok shape, if not a bit puzzled at times by the interface.

But for use as a GPS on the fly while traveling solo, I'd give it a pass.  It just doesn't provide the ease of use or functionality I want in a GPS.","Good GPS Unit, OK For Planning, Not Great For On-The-Fly",1250553600,3,

Another surprise, installation woes. Windows 7 in 2012, and you still can't install a simple program without issues. In my case, on a quadcore AMD 64-bit Windows 7 computer. On the third installation attempt, the Program Compatibility Assistant finally sorted it out on its own and the darned thing installed.

After the successful installation, you run the software for the first time. You have the option to register it, and then it automatically checks for updates on the internet.

From within the program, you can then select to install the State Program. You get one free State program with this version, but not a free state e-file. You can purchase additional State programs if you need multiple states. Installation of the State program is a program installation in itself, you have to close the H&R software and go through the installers.

Preparing taxes was the usual routine, going through the different Q&A screens, and on and on. Navigation, usability, and explanations could have been better. The e-filing part worked without issue. The Search feature is borderline useless, it looks like something from 1999. The program gets things done when you slog through it, but after so many years at it, it should have been a lot better at it.

Another major point of irritation: you get five free federal e-files and zero state e-files. It would be more fair if they offered five free e-files and it would be up to the consumer to decide how to use them, federal or state or a combination! Overall it does what it's supposed to do, in a rather clumsy fashion, but you can get things done.

I have not used the customer support or live help options, so I can't comment on them.

Even though I have been using this program for many years, it is disappointing to see how little things have changed in terms of user-friendliness and installation and operations.

Miller,"IF you have pattern sensitive or motion sensitive epilepsy ( or have problems with blinking, flashing, motion, animations, etc. ) DON'T INSTALL SP3 FOR A WHILE. I cannot use Vista because of accessibility problems so I have to use XP.

2008-05-08
The Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3 makes changes to XP that severely affect accessibility for people with some forms of epilepsy. I suspect that Microsoft is partially trying to install some Vista style features ( ripped off from Apple ). In particular, I have seen Apple style ""sliding down"" menu boxes or whatever they are called. As an example, open the ""control panel"" applet. BEFORE, it was accessible, NOW, the elements at the top of the left column ""slide"" down. I had enough bad seizures ( bad in this case means very unpleasant - I can actually feel them in my brain ) that, after experimenting trying to disable this abomination, at had to get away from the computer.

For people like me, my computer is my lifeline. Since Macs are absolutely not accessible, we are stuck with Microsoft Windows XP. Vista is absolutely not accessible, as is Leopard, etc. With Microsoft destroying the minimal accessibility of XP, there is nowhere to go.

IF YOU DECIDE TO INSTALL SP3 - FULLY BACKUP YOUR COMPUTER SO YOU CAN REVERT TO SP2 IF YOU HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. ( I have two notebooks; if I cannot figure out a workaround, then I will never be able to install SP3 )

BTW, I review so that other people like me can find information about products to avoid and so that they can realize that the problems that they are having are common to other people. There is essentially no accessibility any more. It is so bad that it is only a matter of years before we can no longer live in this society due to blinking, flashing, etc.

Workaround:
Control Panel | System | Advanced | Performance - SETTINGS
Unclick EVERYTHING that allows animation, fading, sliding, etc. I am not sure how comprehensive this will be but it helps.

BTW, FULL accessibility demands that the display be totally ""quiet"" as far as any unnecessary motion or blinking. Unnecessary features that make Windows XP inaccessible are, in particular, ""progress bars"", animations for copying files. Microsoft Word has major accessibility problems. The animations associated with spell checking ( the IDIOT animated book icon at the bottom of the screen - every time you type the animations start.

My biggest complaint? It keeps crashing in Google Chrome. I don't feel fully protected. I get regular messages of ""This plug-in has quit working. Do you want to stop it?"" or ""Norton has crashed. Reload page?"" SEVERAL TIMES a day. When I am working or playing or just whatever. It has also slowed down my Chrome page loading times. So no, I am not a happy Norton user and will probably uninstall this and buy 360 despite this version being free to me for a year for my honest review.

It reloads fairly quickly--or appears to--then it crashes again a few minutes later. I am using it on two different computers--a desktop PC and a laptop PC and it does this on both devices. I am wary. I don't feel safe. I am NOT inclined to try the password vault feature after all of that. Which doesn't lead me to recommend the product.

Based on the high quality offering of the ""German Level 1, 2, 3"" set, that reputation appears to be well deserved.  The package is far more than just a book on German in digital form, and includes many extra features to make the whole thing worth the hefty price tag.

The three level German language software comes with a USB headset so that the user can listen to the lessons without disturbing anyone around them.  The headset has a built-in microphone that works with the software's speech recognition feature, which lets the user know how they are doing with the language.  A quick-start fold out card is also included, complete with pictures and step-by-step instructions, to get the user started quickly.

The software isn't hard to install, but it is a very long process.  The entire installation could take more than a half hour, especially if the massive web updates are downloaded.  Any decent computer system should be able to handle the software, as the program only requires 512 MB of RAM and 1.8 GB of hard drive space.  Both Windows XP and Windows Vista are currently supported.  There is an interesting option that can be set during the installation to change the software to start with a different language.  The program doesn't have to go from English to German, but can instead begin with several different starting languages.  That alone already makes it more versatile than any German language book could ever be.

Another neat add-on that is included is a set of stickers that can be attached to a keyboard.  The stickers mimic a German language keyboard, which will make typing in German easier once the basics of the language have been mastered.  The user's guide is also exceedingly comprehensive, so any questions about how to use the software shouldn't require a call to tech support.

Once the program is installed and started there are several different course options to choose from.  Each option tackles a different aspect of learning the language, such as reading, writing, and speaking.  The default option is to learn all three at once, but for those who don't have enough time for the full course or are only interested in one of the courses there is the option to remove one or two of the features.
As the name suggests there are three levels to the software, each building on the concepts in the last.  As the user progresses through the program they switch out the CDs to the next level.  The program also comes with multiple audio companion CDs so that the user can practice their German when they aren't in front of their computer.

While the price may be a big deterrent for some, there is enough high quality material in the Rosetta Stone German language software that anyone who is really committed to learning the language should seriously consider it as an option.",Comprehensive and packed with extra features,1248825600,,

My notes below are brief because my goal was to list the attributes that persuaded me to keep this software rather than reverting to Office 2004. Indeed, I kept Office 2004 on my computer for five months after I installed this suite, so I could do side-by-side comparisons and decide which version to keep.

THE GOOD:
* PowerPoint functionality is more robust.
* PowerPoint themes make it simple to assemble an attractive basic presentation on the fly. While documentation and help are sketchy, applying brute force logic (and some experience with Photoshop and Quark) enabled me to make PowerPoint do some visual processes I thought that it ""should"" be able to do.
* Word loads faster and is more intuitive. It also has more modular components.
* PDF creation in Word is a simple ""save-as"" menu selection, which saves time compared with the print>save as PDF workaround.
* Anecdotally, Excel and Word are much better-behaved than the previous versions, with no and few hangs, respectively. I am a light user of Excel but use Word daily; the almost-daily aggravation is a thing of the past.

THE CAUTIONS:
* As with other Microsoft products, this suite does chew through a lot of resources. However, after trying out its svelter competition, I come back to Office for my personal use because of the convenience of using what most other folks use.
* Despite multiple attempts and multiple unanswered electronic queries to Microsoft, I have not been able to complete the online registration/tagging that is the last step of the install. (All seems well without it, but this situation leaves me a bit uneasy.)
* The install process is time-consuming. Allow at least two hours to install the software and then download and install multiple patches, even with lots of free space available on your hard drive. Contrast this with the approximately one hour it took to move from Leopard to Snow Leopard and perform further updates. For context, I used to do clean installs of OSes on our work Macs every two months back in the bad old days.

VideoStudio is easy to drag and drop clips together in a project and to drag and drop transitions between the clips to produce a nice final project.  A lot of tasks are intuitively easy (whereas other software leaves to reading through poor documentation to try and figure out how to do something).

Almost every company wants to sell you new version after new version year after year.  At least Corel provides some very nice (low cost) upgrade offers.  Certainly some of the time you'll want to take advantage of the upgrades to utilize new hardware abilities or a new software feature but generally I find it's reasonable to go several years between upgrades.","Works Well, Reasonably Easy to use",1461456000,2,

First of all, installation is slow. Even though I installed the program from the DVD, it still goes on line to install parts of the program. Even with a fast internet connection, downloading and installing those parts, especially .net, took a long time. Even more annoying is it tries to install the Bing search engine and MSN Live toolbar...pretty lame for such expensive software, but at least it gives you the option to opt out.

You have to activate it before you can use it, and it took four tries to activate over the internet.

The new interface is similar to the the one in '04, only with larger icons. Navigating is more clumsy, however. In MP 2004, there was a toolbar icon which toggled between zoom and pan mode. If you wanted to zoom in on an area, you held down the left mouse button and dragged a square and clicked inside it.

In MP 2010 left click/drag is only pan. To drag to zoom you have to use right click/drag. The only way to find this out is from the help files. Not hard to find, but an unnecessary ""improvement.""

Drag to zoom is also touchy...not always making a zoom box, but sometimes bringing up another dialog.

There's a handy Bing map icon, and it doesn't default to IE... it uses your default browser, a pleasant surprise. Bing map defaults to ""Aerial"" view, which is higher up and often in b&w vs. ""Bird's Eye"" which is color and better resolution. Google maps, however offer better resolution and closer views in most cases.

Another interface quirk I discovered: In the ""Search"" box, right click commands (cut, copy, paste) work. In the Trip Planner, however, they don't, and you must use the keyboard commands (<ctrl V>, etc).

I put in trip plans for known destinations and it was pretty good. The maps are up to date.

I don't have the other hardware to test the gps or mobile phone features.

If you have a business that depends heavily on travel this might be the one for you. If you just need simple software for trip planning, Streets and Trips for about 1/8 the price will probably work just as well.",Bloated Mapping Software,1268438400,2,

That leaves the big question of does this package offer much difference between it and previous versions of Microsoft Office?

That is a question that isn't quite as easy for an end-user like me to answer.  Sure, Microsoft will point to a bunch of improvements that were suggested by the user community and the likes of focus groups, but whether or not most users would really find something has been improved is debatable.  Worse, in some cases, the question is really whether or not things have gone completely in the other direction (such as the seeming lunacy that led Microsoft to change Office 2013 and Office 2016 to use only the color themes that there included with Office, rather than using the color themes that were set within the Operating System.  A decision that was compounded all the more by offering only a very limited and very similar group of themes in Office 2013 - something that was improved slightly in Office 2016).

Functionally, I think Office 2013 and Office 2016 are fine.  They are easy enough to use and shouldn't be that confusing for prior users (though if you are making the leap from Office 2003 or Office 2007 you'd find that there is a LOT of difference from prior versions) of the Office product suite.  If you are looking to upgrade, or need a copy for a new computer, then you should be fine with Office 2016.

My initial reaction to Money 2004 was negative, but I got used to it over time. My new bank only provides downloads to Quicken, which makes sense given Money's extinction, forcing me to migrate back to Quicken. I can't say that I'm very impressed.

The interface is very clunky; I doubt it's improved at all in the five years I've been away. (Even Microsoft Money 2004 had a cleaner interface, and Microsoft undoubtedly improved on it over the years.) There are too many different levels of menus -- top-level, register-level, account-level, and more -- which makes use of the product confusing. The one thing I really appreciated about Quicken in the past is thankfully still there: when you balance an account, you have the option of deselecting all qualifying items and then reselecting them one at a time. (In Money 2004, you would have had to manually deselect all of the items.) This allows you to balance your account by ticking off transactions one-by-one.

The product is for some reason dependent on Internet Explorer; when I wanted to register Quicken and when I wanted to download a program update, I had to make Internet Explorer my default browser (otherwise, it's Mozilla). This is annoying, and I don't recall any other non-Microsoft product having this restriction.

I had difficulty setting up one of my banks for automatic download. This is definitely a result of the way that the bank's security is set up, but Quicken (the program; I haven't contacted technical support) has not been helpful in providing clues about how to resolve the problem. (It did provide an inconvenient workaround, but I would like the problem to be fixed.)

I do not like the way that the program promotes fee-for-service programs like billpay that you can get through Quicken.com. This is only a minor annoyance, but it's built into the program.

In all, Quicken seems like it will do the job I need it to, but it's not elegant or fun. Unfortunately, it's the only game in town.

I found the product was cheaper on Amazon.com, so I bought it here with no ""discount"".

One major gotcha is the Quicken automatically scans your history for recurring payments and creates reminders for them.  If you have reminders set up in MS Money, you are supposed to ""delete all reminders"" before importing the data into Quicken... but nothing during the import process says this, nor in the non-existent instructions but after searching for the problem in the support forums I found out what I should have done....

I'd also like to be able to understand the conversations of people around me.  This is why I really was interested in Rosetta Stone versus a quick and dirty travel language CD.

This product allows you to customize it to your goals (read, write, listen, speak) through a very simple startup screen (which can be setup for different users) and then it automatically builds the lessons for you.

I find the lessons to be enjoyable and very useful. The speech recognition aspect is awesome. It lets you even customize how precise you want the software to grade your pronunciation.

Aside from the computer aspect, this product provides a whole set of CDs that complement the main software. This is great for reinforcing your learnings when you aren't in front of the computer.

The downsides of the product do NOT outweigh the upsides in my opinion. However, I should list a few for you. 1) It is pricey. 2) It doesn't allow you to run it on more than one computer (you can move it to a new computer, but you have to uninstall it from the first computer). 3) The included headset is a bit flimsy.

Bottom Line: If you are wanting to learn the language, excel when presented with multiple ways to learn it (visual, auditory, and written), and want to do it at your own pace, I really think this is a great option and can recommend it. If you are only wanting to pick up the bare minimums for surviving travel in Germnay and are on a budget, find another product that focuses on getting you into the basic phrases you'll need.

The lessons feature of Garage Band might be something I might use. The additions to iWeb are good but the program still is only useful for a personal site. It just doesn't offer the search engine optimization capabilities or speed of loading that a business site needs in today's web environment. iDVD has some expanded features and new themes but isn't a have-to-have update.

I'll cover iPhoto first. The new face recognition ability is awesome and amazingly good. I never bothered to make smart albums of individuals before. I went through several thousand photos in a few hours and did that with ease. That one feature makes almost the purchase price worth it all by itself. Geotagging is great. I gave my recent vacation photos location tags and will continue to do so. I'm researching a handheld GPS to sync with my camera so I automate the process. As the number of geotagged photos grows, especially my bird and travel shots. This could turn into a terrific feature. And the tags translate to Flickr maps.

The new built in sharing features in iPhoto are also nice. I can upload to Flickr without exporting and using Flickr's flaky software, or without having to buy a third party plugin. iPhoto also works with Facebook. There are existing free upload plugins for other services like Picasa and Shutterbug that should work.

iMovie has gotten back some of the functionality it lost in the 08 ""upgrade"", not all of it and you still can't use the old third party plugins I bought prior to that, but it is better. The anti-shake function actually does a pretty good job of smoothing out hand held clips. And being able to edit audio directly in the program is very nice. It's a good but not spectacular move up from the last version.

I use Garage Band, too. The new features are limited here. There are some nice interface tweaks. Those don't add much in the way of functionality, but it looks nice. For guitar players, Garage Band has some added effects.

The ability to buy lessons might prove to be a good feature. That will depend on what lessons become available.

1.  They limit downloads, so if your computer crashes, or you get a new computer, you are out of luck.
2.  They are not people friendly, if you call.  Hopefully, you can get a native English speaker you understand.
3.  The method is ok for some people; it is a matter of personal preference.  One should develop one's own method which works best for them.  For example, repetition is best for some, memorization is best for others.  Rosetta Stone has you figure out words based on the pictures and context, and this can be much improved.  This much like how a child learns her/her own language, which is ok.  However, I think someone can make a similar method more suitable for adults.

My suggestions

1. Start with Pimseur.  This method teaches you good pronunciation from the beginning, and develops a basic speaking ability.  It repeats a lot, which many don't like, but I'm not one of them.  Repetition hammers it into your skull, so that you can automatically spit outa word without trying to remember the word.  A shortcoming to many is the limited vocabulary.  Well, this method is NOT supposed to include a large vocabulary; you can best get that from beginner readers and other materials such as French at the Wheel and Living Language courses.  They expand your knowlege, and supplement Pimsleur beautifully.

2. Read French materials on the internet, and even tune in on sitcoms via the internet.  See what the library has, and talk to others for their own ideas.

3. Carefully read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  Many reviews for various items seem fake, to me.  Or reviews are by people who are naive and easily impressed. So read reviews for substance, and if you have time, read what other items a reviewer has reviewed. Personally, I have no problem in harshly rating something.  I tend to give better than average ratings because I've already studied other reviewers carefully, and end up with products deserving good reviews.

-I  purchased and downloaded the deluxe version which includes free federal e-file, but I have to pay $19.95 to e file the state, or I may just print it out and save the money.
- The setup was very easy, but I have a fairly simple tax situation. I didn't have to go into a lot of the categories that seemed more complex, so I'm speaking from that perspective.
- Entered basic info,  W2 info, car taxes, mortgage interest, and the program runs a check for you to see if everything is filled out correctly. It flagged a couple boxes I didn't enter the first time, and it was fairly easy to get back to the page I needed to make the additional entries on.
- I used the help button once, typed in my question and the software answered it and took me to the location where I had to enter the information I had questions about.
- There is a live chat help button, but I haven't used it. I also think you can call to speak to a tax expert if needed as well, which is nice. There are also a good number of HR block offices within driving distance, so I'm assuming if you got stuck they could lend a hand. I like this feature for the first time do it yourself, because if you really get stuck, there's an actual location to go to.
- I haven't e filed, but I ran the ""audit"" check, and it tells you your ""risk of audit"" from green, to yellow, to red, though anyone can be audited from what I read, it shows you the ""chance"" they think you have based on what you entered, or at least thats what I'm getting from it.
- I found it helpful to click through some of the function menus to get familiar with the program before I really started. That seemed to help also.
- I did the download version to avoid having another CD sitting around, and the download from amazon was easy. The program installed, and then updated, and was ready to go. I did have to close out of the initial download screen though, it was giving me an error. So i closed it out, went to my orders, found the purchase and clicked download from there and it went smooth.
- Like I said I'm pleased with this option for my tax situation. There are other competing products, and there are other ways to have taxes done such as an office, CPA, accountant, but for me this seems like something I can handle knowing HR is there to help if it gets tricky.
- Once I e-file I will update this review on how that process went!

** update: I finished my taxes and couldn't be more pleased with the software. The program checked over the return before e filing, led me through some steps to e file, with links when needed, let me pay for the state taxes owed, paid the 19.99 fee to file the STATE..fed was free...printed it all out, it had me back it up to a flash drive, and finished up. HR block sent me emails when my returns were accepted by the IRS and the state, and the software also allowed me to check on this. Pleased overall.

7225,7225,1.0,False,"04 27, 2013",A2VJJ2POCLMED7,B00AM9YXTS,,Marshall Carter,"Sadly, Windows 8 is probably more maligned than it ought to be. In situations that call for more limited input and minimal multitasking (like a tablet or HTPC), Windows 8 actually works fairly well. The issue comes when Microsoft basically forced it onto the desktop workspace, and the fact is that Windows 8 just isn't a desktop OS. The start button is gone, the desktop that we're used to is neutered (really what makes Windows, well, Windows), the native Windows 8 apps are full-screen affairs and as far as the UI goes, it just seems like a major step backward for those who actually work on a PC. Windows 8 basically makes you take a hop, step and a jump where would cold just turn and step in Windows 7. Productivity takes a hit. This is why the businesses aren't adopting it, and that's why Windows 8 is failing.

It works well enough on tablets and HTPC's (IMHO), but I had to dock it an extra star because I've had nothing but bad luck with it. My HTPC was running Windows 7 Pro, so I opted to use the upgrade there. I had to basically erase everything and start fresh with the upgrade, but that's frankly how I prefer to do it anyways. The upgrade process went smoothly and was less time-consuming than I would have guessed. All but one driver was installed, and the OS was running well. I started to install my apps and standard desktop programs without a hitch. So far so good. The next day, I fired it up to continue downloading some things and play a game on Steam only to have the system bluescreen on me. That isn't that big a deal, in and of itself (not my first rodeo with Windows OS'es...bluescreens are almost a certainty at some point), but the options available to deal with it are vague at best (guessing the ""Refresh"" is akin to the Repair Install in Windows XP, while the full Reset is a more traditional Windows reinstall since it gets rid of whatever you have on the PC). The fact that none of them worked is also disappointing.

So here I am, with a nonfunctional PC that had been fine for a couple of years using Windows 7. That in and of itself isn't a condemnation of the Windows 8 OS (again, kind of used to it by this point), but the fact that the OS itself is so NOT compelling that I'm strongly considering going back to 7 probably is. As it now stands, I can't really think of a single compelling reason to upgrade to Windows 8, especially on a traditional desktop or non-touch-enabled laptop. Windows 8 simply wasn't designed with those platforms (the vast majority of the PC market, mind you) in-mind.

UPDATE: Ultimately, the issue that I was having was due to a bad hard drive, so I can't fault Windows 8 for that. Once I received the replacement from Western Digital, I reinstalled Windows 8, and this time all went well. Well, that's not entirely correct...everything went well until activation. It wouldn't work...at all. I searched and saw that this has been an ongoing issue since Windows 8 was in public beta, and it still has not been resolved. Luckily for me, the (overly) tedious phone activation did work, but that shouldn't be necessary. And yes, my wireless network adaptor and router are working properly (it also wouldn't activate over a wired connection).

The PC worked well enough, until this morning. Steam works, Diablo III installed without a hitch, all of my standard apps. As far as compatibility goes, it's been great. I turn on the PC today, only to see that it needs to restart due to updates. Ok...that's typical Microsoft there, so I restart. Nothing. The system posts, Windows 8 begins to boot and then goes to a black screen...that's it. Apparently this is another ongoing issue, and after pressing F8 to go into the repair process, Windows tells me that my system is unable to boot properly (thanks for the tip...). It tells me that it's going to do a restore, and it does. My system starts. That's all fine and good, but I'm growing a bit weary of hoop-jumping. It's obvious to me that Windows 8 isn't ready for prime-time. It's got all of the typical bugs that typify a Microsoft OS. Once those are out of the way and once Microsoft repairs the neutered desktop, Windows 8 might be something to consider, but as things are, you'd do better to wait. Unless you really, REALLY like the Modern (Metro UI) and/or half-baked apps, there's no real reason to upgrade to Windows 8.

UPDATE: I'm done Microsoft. The PC had been running normally until this morning. Upon booting, I notice that I have no connectivity, so I go to troubleshoot my wireless connection. Windows crashes...hard. The PC restarts, and I can tell something is wrong, because it's taking forever. Long story short (and three hours worth of repair attempts later), and I've made my decision to go back to Windows 7. The repairs don't work, the new ""frowny"" BSoD's give precious little information (no error codes, just Microsoft's condolences and a vague error message telling me that my system configuration information was bad...yay). I just want a computer that works, and the only thing I use this PC for is gaming and the occasional movie (have it in the living room). So far, Windows 8 has been a nightmare. Maybe I'll give it another chance once Blue/8.1 hits, but until then, I'm reverting to Windows 7 for my sanity's sake. And that drops my rating to one...same as any other product that can't be used as-advertised.",Upgrade in name only...,1367020800,5,

The amount of export options has to be a big plus, and it includes the ability to easily format any video file or project for any of your mobile devices including your iPod, iPhone, Zune, PSP, etc.  That's a huge thing that many people are looking for.

Some of the newer options like HD and BlueRay authoring aren't going to get wide use immediately, but they are must-haves for the growing HD crowd out there.

Within Video Studio there are a few basic options.  The Movie Wizard is a quick and dirty import and export tool.  This is the easiest option to choose to convert, trim and condense video files.  There's also a bunch of templates included for standard transitions to add some openings, endings, fades and credits.  Once again, even with the Wizard alone you can really clean up some video files fast.

You can even import them directly from you digital recorder, but I opt to save my files and import them afterwords.  I always like to have a backup seperate from what I'm working on, so this makes it easier for me to keep track of my import and export areas.

In the full blown Video Studio tool you can open up video and audio files and add them to a project.  The benefit of that is that you can merge and splice your files and add custom transitions and graphics to really make your videos pop.  Once again, there's a lot of features here.  You really have to spend some time playing and exploring.

Media One is kind of an extra, but it makes it easy to do some basic graphics and picture stuff to add to your videos.  Another extra is Intermedia DVD player, which is included on many OEM system software packages but didn't come with my box.  So that's a nice extra too.

One positive thing is that there are a bunch of tutorials and help file documentats included on your extras disks.  There's also plenty of clips to play with and test your skills on.  If you haven't done video editing before that's probably the best place to start.

Still, I think this program is user friendly enough to do basic things like import / export and conversions out of the box.  Since most people will want to start by collecting all their videos, that's a nice plus in terms of the usability.

One con I have to note is that converting videos to certain formats seems to use pre-set frame rates that take some time to customize.  And it seems to convert some of these formats frame by frame, instead of using much faster file conversion techniques.  Behind the scenes it may be doing more, but for this price I don't really mind waiting a few minutes for my files to convert.

I also own the Pinnacle software that comes with their integrated hardware offering,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinnacle-Studio-MovieBox-Ultimate/dp/B000WEJN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinnacle Studio MovieBox Ultimate</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-Ultimate-Version-12/dp/B001AMSZSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio Ultimate Version 12</a>.  While there are more basic versions of the software that are closer in price to this guy, I find that the Corel Ulead software is more stable overall.

Don't get me wrong, the Movie-box ultimate package is a great value because it includes the hardware interface.  If you don't have all the connectors you need, that might be a good alternative.  But if you just compare software to software, Corel Ulead stacks up well against Pinnacle Studio Ultimate.

Truth be told, for this price I have to forgive the other minor cons I noted.  That includes mainly that the menu and icon graphics aren't the snazziest.  Still, compared to Apple's Built-in editor and Windows built-in movie editor (from Vista Ultimate) this guy includes more formats and features right out of the box.  And once again, for what you get this is really a great value in software.

Definitely check this out.  The Corel site has some clips and information to get you more used to the kinds of things you can produce.

Pleased with so fine a product, I bought many over the years.  Certainly OS X (Panther) has thrown a couple gigabytes of ice water on that romance.  But Panther has made one thing clear that never was before.  Previously I never could quite express what I enjoyed about the older Mac operating systems.  I can now.  Before, I could find things.  And I always knew where I was in the hierarchy of folders.  If I had a document in a folder, stored in a second folder that ordering was always transparent.  I could see the folders open, one inside the other.  And when I closed up, they slipped inside one another quite intuitively.  No more.  In OS X, I haven't a clue.  I do have a 750-page manual that I keep in my lap when working in Panther.  With a trembling finger on the step-by-step instructions and my other hand on the mouse, I can empty the trash successfully.  I know the red buttons close something-sometimes something I wanted closed, but more often my home window.  (Which I've learned to find after a brief but infuriating search.)  There are candy colored yellow and green buttons too though I can't say what they do just now.  It's all there somewhere in the manual, but before reaching for help try a little reason.  If the red pill closes a window, what would logic suggest about the functions of the yellow and green?  Don't bother; logic is no guide in Panther.  And that encapsulates the problem.  In OS X nothing makes much sense, intuition is of no value, everything must be memorized.  The claim is that OS X is bedrock stable.  Try to console yourself with that tradeoff the next time you face the spinning beach ball of death.  Hint: Erase your hard-drive and re-install everything.  A rock after all is a rock.

And don't get me started on the Dock.  I've read (several times) the twenty-page introduction that explains just how easy the Dock is to use.  I condensed all that to a half page of notes, which I've misplaced.  But the little icons do look nifty.  And they do bounce happily-like little corpses on deliberators.  In fact OS X has all the chrome gleam and high-tech awe of a modern hospital.  Yes it is wonderful how technology can keep a body alive on antibiotics, feeding tubes, and assisted breathing.

I had lost track of WordPerfect for a while, but with the X6 package, am amazed at how superior this product is compared to the Office Products that I had been forced to use due to computer issues.  What a breath of fresh air to be using WordPerfect Office instead.  I was hoping to have some problems to warn about or pointers to give, but so far, it is pretty easy and problem free for me!

So far, I have not had any problems translating files from Corel to Microsoft file formats, nor have I had problems reading files sent to me from the newer Microsoft programs.

The Quattro Pro spreadsheet program was great too- easy to use and follow.

The templates are helpful and useful as well.  I have used several of them when I am in a hurry and don't know what else to do.

The help files are all searchable online now so it is easier to access instead of having to pull out a manual.  I will say that the search engine is not always the greatest so you might have to play around with words until you find what you want.

I am still working on exploring all of the program that I can, as it is really enjoyable to use and work with.

I will continue to update as I learn more about the program and if I run into any problems worth mentioning.

I am using this currently with Windows XP but plan on transferring it to my Windows 7 machine I am putting together soon and will update with my experiences there as well.

What separates Turbo Tax from its competitors is their attention to detail. They have made the user interface little more intuitive and went to great lengths to provide a user friendly GUI and pictures. Furthermore, they have made great strides in reducing data entry. For example, I was able to simply download the 1099-D (interest income) from my brokerage online and simply upload into Turbo Tax using a intuitive step-through.

I've added a star (now at three).  If I was to rate how Turbo worked well for me for many years, I would have given it 4 to 5 stars.  I never had a very complicated filing so others might rate differently.  I rated it 2 to 3 stars now because they've let me down this year.  There is plenty of chaos in the world, so I am happy when there is stability and reliability in something, especially MY MONEY!  I've switched to H&R Block.

Over time, Turbo has gradually ratcheted up their price which I could have lived with.  Instead of paying the usual $50 (everywhere you look) for Deluxe, I would wait until about now and buy at a Club store or on Amazon if there was a deal for about $40.

As I read about the changes this year, I got concerned.  I don't think I would really have a problem with this year's version, but what if I did!  I think H&R Block saw an opening and I bought it for about $16 from Amazon.  Why not try it this year?  I see that Turbo has ""backtracked"" on the extra charges.  But, it's too late for me.  Who wants the extra aggravation trying to get your money back?  If H&R works ok for me this year, I won't be returning to Turbo unless they're giving it away!

Turbo is made by Intuit, the SAME company that makes Quicken.  Intuit means ""understand or work out by instinct"".  This is not always the case with either Turbo or Quicken.  Like Turbo, I used Quicken for many, many years.  Every year, they'd come out with a new version, apparently just to generate revenue.  They would totally change the GUI (kind of like what Turbo does).  They would introduce so many errors that it would take the rest of the year to fix them.  Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and simply use my bank's ""on-line banking"" function which is free, saving me $10 a month AND the cost of the yearly upgrade.

At least Turbo doesn't seem very buggy.  However, they do do ""dumb"" things, like always printing Estimated Tax forms for the next year.  They're never correct because Turbo doesn't know about other income I may have the following year.  But, okay.  I just throw away 4 sheets of paper.  I also don't like having to clear a screen every time I start where they want to know if I want to buy more Turbo service.

I found it just right.
When I contemplated self-employment, I had several concerns, including whether or not I could actually keep the wolf from the door that way, but my largest was the thought that I would have to keep records of some kind. I don't have a talent for that. When my sixth client sent me a contract, I searched diligently for a book called, say, ""The Smallest Amount of Accounting Knowledge You Need to Avoid Getting Thrown in Jail,"" but didn't find such a thing. All the books I could find seemed to imagine that I was -- well, an accountant.
Office Accounting Professional 2008 doesn't assume this. It is bossy software.
You know what I mean about bossy software. It reminds you to apply payments to invoices and nags you about putting in people's names correctly and won't let you charge people for ""June.""
In general, I don't like bossy software. Bossy word processing programs often just don't understand complex syntax and don't have as large a vocabulary as I do, and I really don't need my computer to warn me that I haven't been properly introduced to websites.
But the bossiness of this software means that someone like me can put her data in correctly enough to send it off to the accountant -- and there is a system for doing that, too.
I scoffed at the set-up poster, by the way, but it was nice to have some large paper showing all the steps in order. I had no trouble getting the software installed, everything was done by wizards, and overall I found the whole package reassuring.
Now, I have no employees, and I have no interest in eBay, so I sympathize with those who felt that there were more parts to this than they needed. However, I found that this package has just the amount of power I need for keeping track of hours, jobs, clients, income, and expenditure. If I have employees some day, I won't have to learn new software. I can foresee needing to use the banking features, so I'm glad they're there. The extra features don't hamper my use of what I currently need, and I've had the experience before of spending more on trading up than I would have if I'd bought something more powerful to begin with.

In effect, Norton has bundled online backup software with its internet security suite. In principle, it's a nice step, especially since online backup can be an extremely important component when it comes to protecting digital photos/video, documents, etc. The primary issue is that 25Gb of storage just isn't very much in this day and age, and with business such as Amazon and Google offering unlimited online backup space, Norton's place in this world isn't clear. The response might well be that ""I only want to backup docs, so I don't need unlimited storage,"" but my answer would be to point the user to Dropbox's free 2Gb or Microsoft's SkyDrive. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Dropbox all have better, more robust, more user-friendly options when compared to Norton (and if you need *full* system backup, Code42's CrashPlan can't be beat, imo).

So if Norton's online feature isn't that effective, what reason is there to buy this? My gut is to say ""there isn't one,"" but that's not entirely true. You are, after all, getting norton's excellent internet security suite, which has really made a turn-around since the bloatware of just 5 years ago. In this respect, Norton is still top-notch. In that respect, this could well be worth it if you were to find it on sale (or perhaps wanted an online storage option for a business that kept personal accounts like DropBox free of clutter).

All told, I honestly can't rate the online backup option very highly, but because it comes bundled with Norton's internet security, I can't rate it low either.

Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.
However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.

This Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.

With strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.

The other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.

The Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.

In summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.","Great program, versatile, competitively priced",1213315200,2,

This company really wants you to learn their product, as there are differences between this and the other Photoshop-like products. For instance, instead of layers, CorelPhoto refers to them as objects. Pasting an alt-print-screen graphic is subtly different from the way Photoshop does it: you have to select a different option from the Edit menu, ""Copy from Clipboard"". The terminologies used in Corel products are different from Photoshop, but just as sensible. It takes very little patience to get used to them.

-Performance is satisfactory. Routing in real time worked well, there were no complaints.

There was the moment where I realized that Microsoft's GPS unit would not automatically be configured with Streets and Maps, so I had to do it, which was not difficult, but was also unnecessary.

Then select your scenes and import them to the timeline for more editing and refinement. This new application has the potential to save users import time and processing time. How useful is this? It could certainly help with initial editing of a long video. Just don't forget the one scene or scenes that you want to include such as a beautiful sunset still shot.

4131,4131,3.0,False,"11 12, 2009",A1QOK9LU90ACF7,B002ABMVD6,,Centriculous,"QUICK SUMMARY:  A richly-featured, low-cost program is a great introduction into animation, but the program doesn't do much to help new users learn the craft of 2-D animation.

I selected Anime Studio Debut mostly for my kids' sake (teen and pre-teen).  Since earlier this year, they've all enjoyed using a digital camera and Windows Movie Maker to create movies, especially Lego-based movies using Lego-built characters, vehicles and movie sets.  Anime Studio seemed like something they'd enjoy using.  Okay, and I'll admit I was intrigued, too.

In reality, I think the program offers a lot of value for the money, but the implementation for a ""Debut"" program -- one where no prior knowledge of animation is required or expected -- left a lot to be desired.  Although the makers offer a very thorough tutorial to help new users explore the program, I found it to be tiresome switching back-and-forth between the PDF-based, 41-page tutorial document and the actual program.  I prefer the more elegant way of learning a new program where the program itself uses wizards to hand-hold me through the learning process.  For instance, when I learned Sony Vegas Movie Studio earlier this year, its wizards got me using a program that is certainly no less complicated than Anime Studio, and perhaps is more so.  Whereas I continue to enjoy learning how to use Vegas, my enthusiasm for Anime Studio waned quickly.

My older, pre-teen daughter and I were both frustrated at the lack of context-sensitive help or menus in Anime Studio.  I like programs that let me right-click anywhere I happen to be, and a context-sensitive menu pops up with appropriate suggestions for what I'm doing at that moment.

I will credit Anime Studio Debut as being a ""fun"" program.  My pre-teen daughter especially has enjoyed manipulating the template characters that come with this program, giving herself and her siblings a lot to laugh at.  My daughter hasn't tried using the Users' Guide to learn the program -- her learning so far has been by trial-and-error.  If the authors of this program could see my daughter interacting with their program, they could see why a PDF Users' Guide tutorial isn't what's needed for this ""Debut"" program.

I am concerned that Anime Studio crashed a LOT while we've used the program on an otherwise stable Vista laptop computer.  If you install this program, I suggest monitoring the Reliability Monitor (in Vista and Windows 7) to see how reliable your computer currently is, and again how reliable it is after you've installed and begun using Anime Studio Debut.  (To find the Reliability Monitor, click the Start button, then type ""Reliability"" in the Start Search textbox to find the monitor).

SUMMARY:  I think Anime Studio Debut offers a lot of value for the money.  I've spent nearly as much money on stupid kids' games that weren't nearly so interesting to play with.  The functionality of this program is pretty deep.  Where the program comes up short is not on the functionality it has, but in how new users must go about learning how to use those functions.  For a ""Debut"" program, there is a lot that can be done to make learning Anime Studio Debut easier to do.","An arduous learning curve, it's suitable only for the highly motivated",1257984000,47,

I am Japanese American myself but am ashamed to say pretty much the only Japanese I know is being able to order from a menu, or else the more impolite words like ""bakatare"" (stupid) or ""yakamashi"" (loudmouth) or ""monku"" (complaining.. hence the ""monkuboy"" moniker, haha). While my friends went to Japanese school on Saturday mornings I resisted and my parents never forced me so I learned nothing. However, I bet everyone who went forgot how to speak or understand it anyway so we all wound up at the same place.

Regarding this program: The box is impressively heavy. It installed without a hitch using the accurate instructions, though it did take a fairly long time. The headset installed without a hitch also - I use Windows XP and it recognized the device right away and the first test with the software was successful.  It is a rather flimsy headset so you have to treat it gently.  Also, make sure you turn down the volume on your PC before using it because the voices are LOUD.

The lessons are pleasant to take and the sessions last about half an hour which seems about right to digest things. Even though most of it is intuitive as far as what to do (repeat the phrase, match something to a picture, etc.), there is a help screen present and the guidebook that comes with the set is also helpful.

I find Japanese is harder to learn than say Spanish or French because there's hardly any similarity to English (except when they borrow English words, like ""juice"" becomes ""juisah"")in the words or structure. I think the full immersion method is good because it forces you to use the language. I expect to have a basic knowledge after I finish with everything and to be able to converse on a very elementary level.

However, no matter what method you use, it has to be practiced frequently, with a native speaker.  Just like my friends who went to J-School back then, if you don't use it you lose it. At least my parents speak some Japanese and I know a few other people who do so I can bludgeon them with my efforts but for those who don't have someone to practice with, it makes it difficult.

I know someone who has the Korean version of this and he likes it very much (and he has a Korean wife so he gets a lot of free help!).

Based on performance I would recommend that you consider this product along with the other brands available.

[ORIGINAL REVIEW]I have been using Bitdefender for about 5 years and I used to love it. I used this version then upgraded it to the Total version because of an offer from them. The main reason I used to love it was that it was completely non-intrusive; it just caught potential threats and did what it needed to fix them, completely in the background without flashing all kinds of messages on the screen to distract me.

Not so anymore, at this point Bitdefender is by far the most intrusive software I have ever used.  I use my computer a lot with full-screen apps like spreadsheets and graphic tools.  Can you imagine how annoying it is to have huge ads and other popups covering the lower corner of my screen over and over and over?  And there's no way to turn them off, which is a major hindrance to my productivity.  This year's version (2014) now brazenly opens popup windows in the center of the screen as well as in the corner, sometimes at the same time.

On top of that they spam my email box with endless offers.  They started ""warning"" me that my subscription was going to expire a full six months before it did.  I immediately bought a renewal six months early but did that stop them?  No, every single day I got emails warning me, in a tone that was equivalent to impending Armageddon.  I contacted them several times and asked them to stop but they ignored me.

On the subject of contacting them, there is in fact no contact information for them anywhere.  No names, no addresses of U.S. offices.  Apparently they have no support presence at all in the United States.  The only way to contact them is through a help ticket, but what good does that do if they ignore you.

The product itself seems to work, but then again every antivirus program works and essentially looks for the same threats and deals with them the same way so there is no overwhelming reason to use Bitdefender as opposed to any other brand except for cost and support.  When it's not on sale, the cost is equivalent to everyone else so that eliminates that as a reason and they really don't provide any support so honestly I see no reason to recommend this product unless you are lonely and like to be barraged with popup ads covering your computer screen.

On the one hand, I feel that everyone needs some form of protection on their PC - but on the other hands, it is a really big moneymaker for the various companies.

Before I begin on this product, let me explain why I am not a fan of paid AV packages - first of all, there are many great free alternatives. Microsoft Security Essentials is an amazing FREE product, made by the people that made your operating system, so they obviously know a thing or two about protection.

That said, paid AV packages do have one advantage - support. With a free package, you are on your own if you need support from the developers. So, if you can live with solving the occasional support issue yourself, check out a free package. Otherwise, a program like Trend Micro Internet Security is a great option.

Trend is a good reliable product. I feel that they haven't taken the bloated and slow route McAfee and Norton took in recent years - the app does not visibly slow down my machine. Testing security is also a tough one - I have no intention of tracking down an infected site or file just to prove a point.

Installation and operation of the program is simple - I did not run across any issues, and once installed, it clearly shows that my machine is protected. That is pretty much all I can ask of an AV package - fast, east and non intrusive (oh, and cheap). Trend succeeds on all those points.",Does what it is made to do - but why pay?,1267920000,,

One would think it would be the same thing, but it's not. 2012 is easier on my system. I immediately noticed how much faster Internet Explorer runs. I've been using Firefox because Internet Explorer was so sluggish. I thought it was all the browser's fault. Apparently, the 2011 version causes Internet Explorer to slow down. My IE is still not as fast as Firefox, but much better than before.

As for the virus protection, I'm quite satisfied with the performance of Total Protection, which is why I continue to use McAfee. For many years, my husband did not use McAfee, and he was constantly being infected while mine was virus-free. I finally installed Total Protection on his computer. We haven't had much problems since, except for the interval last year when he went without protection for a few days after the subscription expired and he immediately picked up a virus.

If you are wondering whether to install McAfee Total Protection or Mcafee All Access For Pc Mac and Mobile, I'd go with McAfee Total Protection if you are only protecting home computers. It's less expensive, and you'll ultimately get the same software on your computer. If you are also protecting tablets and cell phones, then All Access is better. All Access will protect tablets, cell phones, netbooks, notebooks and PCs. All Access will also enable a user to remotely wipe out date from cell phones and tablets.

I have not yet started using the video editing functionality.

My standard tools for this sort of work have been Adobe PhotoShop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator and some ftp tools. I found that everything which I have done with these more expensive tools was easy to do with CorelDraw Premium Suite X5. A couple of highlights include:

 - Corel Capture. I use screen shots all the time for user documentation, etc. The Corel Capture software that comes with this package offers some handy ways of capturing screen data, as well as content from other sources. It can capture other content such as video playing on part of your screen. It is a handy tool in general.

 - Corel Draw is their answer to Illustrator. Illustrator and I are not particularly close as I lack a skill that is key to its successful use - artistic talent. That being said, Corel has all of the tools that you would need to make the full range of vector drawings and art work you can do with Illustrator. I have a feeling that Adobe is always a year or two ahead in functionality, but Corel then works to add features pioneered by Adobe.

If you are a casual user of the various tool sets offered in these packages, Corel can save you a lot of money without sacrificing functionality.

I own a small graphics company, small publishing company and I write for a living. I upgraded recently to a 64-bit 8-core unit that I built with the help of a software tech engineer. I've never purchased a ""brand name"" computer except years ago when CPM was the hot language of desktops. When DOS came along I started building my own. Each new upgrade is always a challenge since software makers are using more and more space to write less efficient software. That is, they dump the parts of software that are really useful and replace them with ""cute"" stuff that takes one, two, three or more mouse clicks to get to or uncover or work with than it did before -- and it always takes up much more space. Win 7 is an example of an upgrade that I refer to as a downgrade. I have been using XP Pro Professional 32 bit for a long time. I tried to install XP Pro 64 bit but it was totally chaotic, so I had to move into Win 7. I purchased my copy at Amazon. Frankly, I'd prefer to return it as ""broken,"" since I think it's a piece of junk. Apparently those who design today's working software (OS and other software) don't actually use it to make a living. In other words, they aren't self-employed and they don't find themselves relying upon a software to be efficient (time is money made or lost, depending on the amount of time a project takes). Certainly, those who designed everything after XP aren't using what they design to make a living . . .they just design stuff that looks cutesy. Take the icons in Win7. No more lists without large icons next to them and we can't make them smaller. No more Windows Explorer, either. Oh, they say they have it, but they don't. What  they have in place of WinExp is a piece of junk that probably works on an iPhone but not at all well on a desktop. I have this brand new high speed, 32 gigabyte RAM computer and it's SLOWER than the one I'm writing this review on. Yes, I have reverted to my 4 gigabyte RAM, 2-core, XP Pro computer when writing or cruising the Net or doing low space requirement work with graphics. On top of Win 7 being inefficient, Adobe has decided to change their software as well. I'm using CS6 on the Cloud with Win 7 and it's taking longer to get things done than with my older CS2 in XP. An example: Adobe dumped their extract from Photoshop and replaced with something that's, Yup, ""cute."" It doesn't extract well at all, though, so I have to keep this CS2 in this computer and do all that work here (Win 7 doesn't like CS2). Win 7 64 bit also demands a high price for replacing all software from the 32 bit, so even though they tell you that you can use the compatibility mode, it's a lie. Yes, you can install into it, but it runs at the same speed as your older computer whether it's 2-core or 4 or 8 core. Compatibility simply means yes, you can install here and using the (86) mode you can run it.

Bottom line is, there's way too much to list here that doesn't prove efficient once Win 7 is installed. I should have written every single major bump in the road down, but I didn't. I just packed up the computer and placed it into my wife's office and said, ""You now have the world's fastest email computer."" So, we have four computers here. Hers with Win 7 and all the rest with XP. Too many programs would not install and we lost the use of three peripherals including one printer, and two scanners.

So, we'll keep on working with old nuts and bolts on three computers and hope that someday, somebody will design fast, efficient, non touch screen OS software that really works and works with all our software.

WinZip has won accolade after accolade since it was first introduced in 1991 for being one of the best file compression software packages.  If you are interested in compressing files to send as emails, to reduce the size of your archives or to save space on your computer, then you should certainly consider WinZip.  If you are thinking of upgrading from an earlier version of WinZip, you may want to question the advantages of doing so.

Compression Speed
I have been using WinZip 7 for years and so I expected much faster performance with WinZip 15, especially since WinZip advertises that version 15 has a brand new zip engine which requires less time to compress files.  However, I found that despite the new zip engine, the speed of the file compression was about the same as the older version that I had been using.  This may be a function of the age of my computer, but overall, the lack of any noticeable increase in speed was disappointing given the difference in the age of the versions I was using.  Therefore, I don't really see any real advantage of upgrading to WinZip 15 if you are using an older version of WinZip unless you can take advantage of the zipx file.

Zipx File
When using WinZip 15 to compress files, the user has the option of choosing the legacy compression (zip file) or the zipx file which was introduced in WinZip 12.  Zipx offers the advantage of creating smaller compressed files.  However, while zip files can be opened by most compression utilities including the one installed with Windows, zipx files can only be opened by WinZip 12 or later or by a few other compression utilities.  Therefore, zipx files are not as ideal for compressing files you plan to share with others.  To see the difference between the zip and zipx files, I zipped the contents of the My Documents folder which included photos and other multimedia.  The zip file resulted in 25% compression while the zipx file resulted in 33% compression.  However, I have also tried compare the results of compressing Word documents which have lots of images included.  I found that the zipx compression resulted in files that were actually slightly larger than the comparable zip files. The same also happened when I tried to zip mp3 files.  However, in the case of jpeg files, zipx files are 20% smaller than the original or the zip file.  While the advantage of the zipx file is not staggering, it is an improvement if you are creating files for archiving, especially if the archive includes JPEGs.

Installation on Two Computers
It is permissible to install the single license version of WinZip on two computers, as long as they are not used simultaneously.  The exact wording from the WinZip user agreement is:  ""If you have purchased a single-user license you have the right to install and use a single copy of WinZip on one computer or workstation for non-simultaneous use by one or more persons and install a second copy of WinZip on another computer or workstation for the exclusive use of the person who is the primary user of the first copy of WinZip.""

Interface
WinZip gives the option of using the Wizard or the Classic interface.  The Wizard is easy to use and takes the user through simple steps and questions to zip or unzip files.  The classic view includes many more options including 128- and 256-bit key password protection for the zipped files.  It is also possible to zip and unzip files by right clicking on the files in the Windows Explorer.

File Types
In addition to compressing files, WinZip opens and extracts content from the industry's widest selection of compressed file types, including Zip, Zipx, RAR, 7Z, BZ2, LHA, CAB, IMG, ISO, and most other file archive formats.

Email
Click on the mail button in the WinZip interface and WinZip will automatically open your default mail program (including Outlook and web based email such as Hotmail or Gmail).  In the case of Hotmail, I would have expected the first page which is opened to be the page for composing emails.  This is the case if you are already logged into Hotmail, but if you are not, the first page you see is the inbox.  I then had to close the browser page and click on email again in WinZip to start the message composition, but although the subject line of the message had the file name, I found that the file was not attached.  It may just be that WinZip and Hotmail using Internet Explorer do not play well together, but this was a bit disappointing.

Courier
WinZip 15 Standards includes a copy of Courier which automatically zips all files attached to an outgoing email. Courier is great if you regularly email compressed files or photos.  The supported email clients include Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, Gmail and Hotmail.  When you attach files to an email, the standard dialogue box appears which allows you to choose the file to attach.  Courier adds to this window, controls to zip, encrypt or to resize photos which is a useful tool.  There is the option to make zipping files the default which would be useful if you send zipped files quite often, but annoying if you don't want to always zip files and forget that Courier will do this automatically.

Summary
If you don't currently own a compression utility and you would like to compress files for archiving, emailing or to save space on your computer, then you should definitely consider WinZip 15.  The Wizard interface makes zipping files easy for even novice users and the classic interface includes a lot of options for those who want more control of the process. However, if you are considering upgrading from a version of WinZip prior to version 12, you may want to reconsider unless you can take advantage of the compression of JPEG files using the zipx format.",The standard for compressing files and installable on two computers,1303171200,,

The product integrates very well with Office 2007 ( the Full Enterprise Version , as well as lesser  types).With the full MS Office and Norton 360 to be installed,two reboots is common. Norton 360 covers PC Security, Identity Protection,Backup and PC Tuneup in broad terms. When errors in install occur, a reinstall utility covers and easily fixes problems. The setup shuts down Ghost until install is complete, and also until the backup setup is decided upon since 360 has its own backup technique. After initial setup, the configuration is pretty much automatic. All items are set up on what seems to be a standard basis, with the exception of the backup routine, which is something that can be turned on or off ( unlike the other three major sections) so that you can use the Norton GHOST backup should you want to do so. Its an impressive piece of software, great price, installs and operates extremely well.
For a family machine with a non-technical or partially technical background, this is a great piece of software that operates well, and operates automatically.

That being said, my artistic ability is pretty low and I was hoping a too like this could help me out.  And, to a point, it did.  I think it helped me to add a little creativity to some of my pictures but this does not turn somebody into an instant artist.  I do think to truly get the most out of this product a little bit of artistic ability does help.

I was hoping it was a bit more like Photoshop for photo editing, never having used it before, but that's not really its primary aim (there are some functions there, but there are better products). This is more like a souped of version of Paint where you can take photos and apply different textures and filters to it, as well as touch it up with an abundant selection of different brushes and effects. The interface is also a bit dumbed-down, and it's missing some of the higher-end features of the full Corel Painter, and while that might sound off-putting, for those prospective users that are not professional artists and don't have years of experience, that actually works in your favor. There is still a learning curve with the software (I'm still trying to sort through a lot of the features and what works well with some images, but not with others), but it's nowhere near as daunting as Photoshop (or even the Gimp).

As something that sometimes comes across as a higher-end version of Paint, drawing tablet functionality is almost a must, and I've found it to be pretty good. I have an older (and decidedly low-end) Genius F350 graphics tablet and it worked well within the program. It's certainly not a great tablet, but to be honest, I can't really imagine using this program without one. If you intend to get the most out of this program on a desktop (or even a tablet without some kind of stylus), it's almost a prerequisite.

As for the technical issues. I had no problems installing the program (which I did from an external USB optical drive), nor have I had any issues with it crashing (running under Windows 7 64-Bit). If you don't have an optical drive, Corel makes the installation files available for download on their site, so that's largely a non-issue (which is important with more and more tablets and ultraportables not having them). I installed this on my desktop which was built for low power-consumption since it's on nearly 24-7. The CPU is a quad-core Celeron J1900, with 8GB DDR3-12800 memory and a 240GB AMD SSD. Performance is more than acceptable, although I'm sure a higher-end system would probably speed it up, but I have no complaints, even on my lower-end system.

All-in-all, Corel Painter Essentials 5 is a fairly inexpensive and functional program for those who would be more likely considered dabblers. It works well for casual users and doesn't require a powerhouse to run decently. If you're looking for something to play around with your photos a bit, this is a fun and functional option, but if you're looking for more straightforward photo-editing capabilities, then this may not be the best.",Simplified interface makes this better for casual users.,1425427200,,

It also installed the latest Norton toolbar, including Vault which can be helpful as a way of bringing up password-protected sites, and this latest Norton imported my passwords intact (including the password to open Vault). These days, when you need different (and un-memorizable) passwords for every site, this function is more important than ever. This latest version of Vault is more user-friendly and intuitive.

You can load from the CD or online from Norton. One oddity if you download online: in Windows it doesnt automatically load to the usual Download file, at least not in Vista. I had to specify a folder. Ive loaded from the CD and it seemed easier, at least in Vista.

1. Option to install from the furnished CD or to go to Norton online and enter the product code. If the latter, be advised it takes some time to download even with DSL.

But I've learned not to pre-judge the older games; it's the plot and puzzles that drive these games, not the graphics. That said, this game was not mind-blowing. If you want to go for a classic Nancy Drew title, I would suggest the game that came after this, Treasure in the Royal Tower (#4). I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannah's renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.

I thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said ""20+ hours of gameplay"", but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects' things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasn't as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered ""educational"". Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like ""Oh great, here comes another history lesson.""

CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didn't have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Rose's and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Ned's voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.

The graphics were... interesting - but I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering it's an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I don't know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.

Phone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancy's in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drew's live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time I've been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannah's voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didn't call her very much.

SETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.

PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle ""in the corner"". I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.

IS IT CHALLENGING? No. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didn't have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasn't like ""Maybe you should take a look at the library again!"" it was more ""Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf."" Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didn't want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.

ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.

 It is a more than adequate video editing and slide show creation program. Definitely faster to deploy than Adobe Premiere Pro and Premiere Elements. Not as feature laden as Adobe Premiere Pro, but more than enough cool stuff for doing pretty complex video productions.  Execution speed is very respectable, though the program does crash more often than I would prefer.

 A major plus is Cyberlink's Director Zone where you can download thousands upon thousands of effects, templates and such. Many, if not most, are a little cheesy, but there's a lot of excellent stuff as well.

 Cyberlink's approach is ""video editing for dummies"" - and that is a compliment. Everything is accessible, nearly all functions are easily understandable. For most people, PowerDirector is all they need. I like it (along with Magix Movie Edit Pro) because the programs are quick to deploy, easy to learn and (most of time) work as advertised.

 Is PowerDirector Ultra a replacement for Adobe Premiere Pro or other high end video editing applications? No. But most people simply don't need Premiere Pro.

 Now, my enthusiasm is tempered by what I don't like about Cyberlink as a company. Their tech support is sub-par: questions are often answered with form letters put together by people who obviously did not understand the question. Cyberlink's product cycles are very short, often less than a year before you are being asked to buy an expensive upgrade.

 Overall, I think CyberLink PowerDirector 10 Ultra offers good value to the end-user. It will cover the needs of most people for video editing and slideshow production. Tech support is, in my opinion, is not what it should be and the short cycle upgrade policy is brutal.

When installing the Power Director 13, Make sure you read the EULA, I cannot emphasize that enough.
The Power Director has Many editing tools, and the thought that springs to mind is maybe it has too many or too much in the way of tools; with some products you feel like saying, just focus on a few things that you do well, and do that or do those.

In the Install process, it asks ""do you want to install Smart Sound"", and this is a no brainer; quite a good add-on, and works well with other products.
I favour the use of Still photos, and making them ""pop"" for want of a better phrase, and there-in lies my learning curve. You can use video from the SAMSUNG memory cam which is really for basic Video. Some quite good video can be obtained from the Canon Eos T5, and then you just edit. If you have Photo shop, this can work some wonders , since a live shot with reminisces  of other times, or maybe some people who have passed, can be trasnitioned in as the person on the video talks. When you use this, Audio tracks work wonders; you can have a basic music track, and then if you have audio of the person who has passed, or other people talking about a person ( alive or passed ), then this product can transition the audio, and the images. So cool.

Make sure that you have plenty of memory, and if needs be, use a dedicated PC or , laptop or desktop, with at least 12 gig ( mine has 12 ) so that you can easily edit the large slab of content. If you have less than 12 gig of ram, use more virtual memory, and shut down unnecessary applications so you can grab all the available CPU and memory. I am not a fan of the Cloud option, so forget that, in my view. And use a second drive. If you have a SSD drive, use that for your virtual, especially if you can link that in with a USB 3 cable.

All in all this is a great editing set. Also, if you really feel like using the second disc with optional extras, be careful, since it chews up CPU and memory like crazy.
The capability is immense, but make sure you have the tools to use this great product . Some of the specs for memory and CPU on the box seem more than a tad optimistic, and I would say that easily you would need to double it. I have had problems at times with 12 Gig, and I was being careful. The 3 D options are neat. Also, use a Blue Screen or neutral colour backdrop for some elements you want to import, especially if you do a kind of interview scenario for the PIP ( picture in Picture) elements. If you read the guides and use your imagination, this tool, plus some great extras like Tascam portable audio recording ( 2 and 4 channel options) make for a ""skies the limit"" type of ability.

In some cases I am very fortunate, as some lines of my genealogy records so far go back almost 1,000 years.  In other cases because one side of my family recently emigrated (or more accurately, most are still in Iran), I have very little reliable information going back even 50 years.  So I can have both the puzzle and the satisfaction of a ton of information, and I need a lot of good research tools as well as a great way to organize my work.

I've used Ancestry.com before, without additional software, and the difference between the website and Family Tree Maker's GUI is substantial.  It's much faster and easier to work with this software.  I found the included documentation easy to use.  Importing pictures and documents was also easy, which was awesome as I have two very extensive word documents from two relatives that are now preserved for my family to enjoy.  I ran through a bit of the tutorial and found it well made, but the software was intuitive enough that I really didn't need it.  Exporting appears to be very straightforward as well.

For that matter, I put a lot of time into this software and have already exhausted my free month.  In that time I did not encounter any glitches.  Solid software.

Another point about Ancestry.com is that I don't really need a persistent subscription.  I'll get on this kick once in a while, usually just after the holidays, and then I'll go a year or more without having time for it.  This software gives me the best of both worlds as I retain my work and can even update my digital family tree, as well as share it with family when they visit, but I only have to pay for Ancestry.com on months where I'm going to be using it.  All my work is stored locally on my computer.

The different editions primarily pertain to the duration of the included membership.  I have the Essentials edition, which is the one I'd recommend as the best practical value, even though the Platinum costs less per month of Ancestry.com use.  And Ancetry.com is the real deal and will be of tremendous use to most people who are researching their family history.

The family tree viewing is dynamic and intelligently conveys relationship information in a variety of ways, especially for very detailed family trees in the Pedigree mode.  For me this had the effect of making it much more fun to include a lot more information and more relatives on my tree (and actually all of them).  The other effect is that people actually enjoy seeing my family tree, because it is actually easily presented on screen.

Despite all the monopolizing and heavy-handedness and rushed updates, I have always felt they did more good than harm.  I have yet to find a Microsoft product I didn't like... until now.

In a word, Microsoft Money 2005 is ""horrible"".  I only gave it 2 stars because it still beats paper and pen :)

Now, if you're a new user, you probably won't notice anything bad about it and will continue on your merry way.  Bravo for you (just don't do anything online until they release the second patch (yes, there's already one out) since 2005 is apparently quite broken with respect to about 50% of the institutions it claims to support).

If you're a previous Money user, pocket your $30 and invest it, using your old version to track the savings.  I was terribly disappointed in 2005.  To begin with, helpful features such as Bill Minder, ""dual category lists"", ""in-register"" spending forecast and upcoming bills, are gone.  What have they been replaced with?  I have no clue.  As far as I can tell, they've replaced them with a HUGE toolbar (a la MSN Explorer but without the option to resize) and a LOT of white space (the register displays about 30 lines max (on ""compressed"" view) and runs literally down to the bottom of the screen.)

The home page actually displays less information (though it is prettier in a way) and the settings ""menu"" is a fiasco (again, much like MSN Explorer) with numerous hyperlinks that are not necessarily intuitive.

From what I could tell, reconciliation seemed to work as expected, but seemed to offer less information than 2003 did.  I did not even take the time to get into investing since I uninstalled 2005 within 24 hours (and I am, without doubt, a ""give it time"" kind of person).  I honestly felt like I had less control over my finances (or at least less information with which to make informed decisions) and didn't want to risk botching up my portfolio.

That's about it.  I know it's a short review and probably leaves many questions unanswered, but I had only invested 24 hors in 2005 so a ""roll back"" to 2003 was fairly straightforward (and evidently necessary).  To take more time would have meant a more difficult reversal.  Again, I normally like MS products, but I can promise you this one will be going back to Redmond at their expense (30-day Money Back Guarantee).

I would STRONGLY recommend against buying Money 2005.  It just isn't worth the money (I honestly wouldn't even take it free now).  I can see no enhanced functionality and it actually appears reduced in places.  The interface has been radically changed and, aside from being pretty, actually reduced my sense of ""control"" over my finances.  Again, if you're brand new to Microsoft Money, I think you'll be satisfied.  However, if you're a previous user... well... you've been warned...

PS Did I tell you that Money automatically (read: ""Did not ask"") reorganized my categories?  It decided to treat ""Dining out"" as its own primary category instead of as a subcategory of ""Food"", effectively reorganizing over 100 transactions.  This might have been OK if Money had asked, but it didn't.  Makes me wonder what else was changed without my approval...",Stick with your old version and use it to track the savings,1095811200,193,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Old review-
I am a home software tech (28 years).
I can see why SO MANY reviewers had so many NSW problems...!- NSW is tricky..., and difficult to install PROPERLY, especially if you had old Norton..., or ANY other anti-virus (see ""Fix-It Utility 6..."", below)!! NEVER run two ""active"" anti-virus, or anti-spyware!
My install procedures... (below) can be adapted for ALL Norton antivirus..., or any others (corrupted system too...!)!

Features+!-
1. NSW 2006 automatically updates NEW virus definitions DAILY (0-25). ALL older versions only update ""once a week (no matter how often you run Live Update!)""!
When NSW daily updates definitions, it automatically does a ""Quick Virus Scan""!

2. My email... scanning is MUCH faster, than with old Norton!
a. My Symantec total System Performance Test went UP from 295 to 1350 (DELL XPS400, 3.2ghz Pentium D cpu, Raptor 10,000rpm single sata hard drive (WOW!), 2000mb memory)!
b. System antivirus scan is a little slower, but more thorough (found 2 viruses my old Norton missed!)! Protection center takes a minute on startup to scan for security problems- GOOD!).
You should also consider GOOD ""full time"" spyware protection!-
#1 Spyware Doctor (84%, latest independent test...), or
#2 SpySweeper (66%). The rest are abysmal!

~~~
1. The biggest reason that sooo many people have dificulties..., is that they don't ""COMPLETELY"" get rid of their old antivirus/""LiveUpdate..."" first!!!
A simple add/remove... uninstall, won't do it!- Browse the Symantec support..., for uninstall instructions on your ""EXACT"", product BEFORE you attempt an uninstall (see SymNRT...)!
I found Symantec free email tech support to be fast (48 hrs max) and EXCELLENT!

Note A- Procedure (takes 1 hours+, to do it right!)! Print procedure out, before trying (VERY detailed/complex!)!

Note B- You may think this long procedure is a hassle..., but much better than a full system reinstall! It's FUN when things... go right, and an ""advanced"" learning experience!!!

 IMPORTANT NOTE C!- ALWAYS wait for your HD (Hard Drive) light to stop blinking (for 15 seconds)!- Just because ANY application... says Finished/Restart Now..., it hasn't removed/written/finished ALL the registry/files... yet! SLOW DOWN, & you'll see HD blinking!

Backup your ""critical..."" files (Favorites, cookies, email address book..., email ( I recommend ABC Outlook Express!- saves all & trees too!)  to an ""external"" source.

I  then use Acronis 9 (same as Ghost, but dependable!) for a ""Full Image Backup"", to a Western Digital external HD, and really like it (see my amazon.com Acronis 9 review...)! Easily restore your WHOLE system. Acronis is not compatible with Ghost or GoBack (NSW... also recommends NOT installing GoBack!)!

1. Disconnect from internet & restart.

2. COMPLETELTY uninstall/remove ALL previous Norton/Symantec... pgms &  tracks...!-
 a. Uninstall ALL old Norton... pgms- Norton..., GoBack, Ghost, Live Update, WMI, Live Reg... Restart after each! SLOW DOWN!
 b. Symantec uninstall NSW advisory, tells you how to FIRST disable ALL NSW services (VERY complex!), as XP uninstall will not ""completely"" remove old NSW files/registry... in use (many processes are hidden...!)!
You should not have to do this IF you ""lastly"" run #1 Fix-It Utilities 6 (see my Amazon.com review!). I disabled services... & Fix-It still found/deleted over 250 invalid registry/files (Cleanup, Fix Registry... Green only!). My ONLY ""safe"" registry/file cleaner that found/deleted ALL...!
Restart.

3.  Run chkdsk... (to repair ANY System/file errors...!)-
My Computer, RIGHT click on C drive, Properties, Tools, Error Checking, check Auto
Fix... (ALWAYS check!- System errors too!).
Restart, ""TWICE!"" & SLOW DOWN (all changes don't take effect, until HD light stops blinking!)!
  a. Defragment your HD ( I recommend Diskeeper 10 Professional Premier!- REALLY speeds up your computer (40%+ WOW!)!!!- see my amazon.com review)).
  1. WAIT 1 minute (Registry changes, after ANY defrag is slow!)! Restart!  You can also defrag from C Tools (as in error chkdsk... procedure above, but- Defragment Now instead of Error Check...)...

4. Now you are ALMOST ready to install NSW- On to ""Clean Install Mode""!-
ALL services & programs MUST be stopped (especially anti-spyware! See my amazon.com review on SpySweeper!).
This is how to safely/easily do a ""safe/clean install"" (for that matter- ALL pgm installs!), in disabled... mode.
 a. Start, Run, put "" msconfig "" (sans quotes) in box. OK
  1. Put a dot in Selective Startup. Remove check from Load Startup Items. Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  2. OK, Cancel (gray boxes. Wait for hour glass & HD lights!)
  3. wait 1 minute & Defrag again (slow down! This makes NSW files contiguous/performance!) & restart TWICE...!

4. Now to install NSW (no internet, firewalls, no nothing!)-
 a. Dot in Custom Install!
  1. Uncheck- !GOBack! (Per NSW- plays havoc..., even if you don't have Acronis!). Utilities box, uncheck- System Doctor, Speed Disk, and any others...,  you don't use...
  2 . Good ones!- WinDoctor, DiskDoctor, Explorer Extension... (if you don't know..., leave them)...

b. IMPORTANT NOTE!- During the install it check/asks you if you want ""Worm Protection"". This is REALLY a sorta firewall, in disguise (I had to start over here... DRAT!, as it conflicted with my Sygate 5.5 firewall! DRAT)!
Luckily I had an Acronis system restore backup! (XP restore is flaky... & doesn't do it ALL!)!
  1. ONLY If you don't already have a 3d party firewall ( I really like Sygate ""5.5!, only!""!), REMOVE the check.
  a. If you only have the standard XP firewall, leave it in!
  3. Install NSW be VERY patient & SLOW DOWN (always!)!

c. Remove CD, Restart . SLOW DOWN!
  1. Manually start your 3d party firewall (if you have one), & log onto internet (hope you have high-speed!).  You may have to do this around... the NSW messages...
  2. Wait awhile, & Norton Protection Center will keep coming  up with ""do now..."" alerts!
  a. Whatever you do, ""always"" exit this now...!
  b. Whatever you do DON'T run ""One Button Checkup...""!
  3. Actvate NSW... (I didn't register?)
  4. If Live Update doesn't come up automatically (slow)-
Open NSW... & do a ""Live Update (biggy!). Be VERY patient (seems like not-responding, but is really working...). Restart when asked. SLOW DOWN!
  5. Enable 3d party firewall, and Live Update again. Keep doing this until no more updates.
Restart.

5. Disconnect from internet & go back to Run/msconfig..., and remove the gray check from Load Startup Items, again. Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  a. Defrag again (packs NSW files, for performance).
  1 minute, & Restart.
b. Now go back to Run/msconfig... & put dot in ""Normal Startup"". Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  1. Log onto internet. Restart.
  C. This is a GOOD time to do another Acronis backup!

6. DANGER!- All NSW Cleanups... will delete your IE favorites & cookies! To save them...-
  a. Open NSW, Options, Norton Cleanup, Internet Clutter & remove check from cookies..., ""Saved Web Sites"" folder & ""Import Favorites"", Apply, OK.
Restart (ANY changes... don't take full effect, until AFTER a restart!).

7. Now schedule a weekly system scan- Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Scheduled Tasks, RIGHT click on Norton Scan..., Properties, Schedule (set time...), Apply, OK. Close out... & Restart.
Do an Acronis back up...!

DONE!

Glo's features are listed in the Amazon's Product Description so I won't go into those.  I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now. I think the loading time..switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc..sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program. If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.

As a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.

Check out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.

This program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:

Audible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.

A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.

I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.

And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.

In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!

This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.

UPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop.

I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.

If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.","If you've used TurboTax before, you know what to expect.",1388966400,,

I only tried this after struggling with Peachtree's cumbersome software and non-helpful technical support for a great deal of time. In comparison, QuickBooks was a breeze!

Installation was quick and painless, and I started setting up my business. The software asked me EXACTLY the types of questions I wanted to answer. What were my credit card accounts. What were my checking accounts. What assets did I have. Did I want to be generating invoices for sales? Did I want to be creating employee records? It was very quick and easy, and the built in help answered exactly the kinds of questions I had along the way.

When I got into the main software after that initial setup, again it was incredibly intuitive. Simple buttons let me leap to areas I had interest in - Banking, Customers, Vendors, Employees, Business Services and Reports. I was initially interested in setting up the history from my bank accounts and checking accounts. Voila - I simply hit the BANKING button and there I was!

I've used QuickBooks for MANY years now and tend to upgrade each year to stay on top of the latest changes (and to reduce the issue of bugs). While it can be confusing at times, and I recommend getting some sort of an ""accounting for dummies"" book to make sure you track things properly, it definitely makes running a small business a much easier task.

Right now I am using QuickBooks Pro 2009. The upgrade to this version was seamless. I am running it on Windows 7. There are still some things that are confusing to me - like setting up a barter account which then helps someone you've lent money to to pay off the ""asset"" you have of their loan. It seems QuickBooks documentation often has very simple situations explained but not more complex ones. Still, the web has several support communities to help you with items like this, to get your issues resolved.

In general I've been very pleased with QuickBooks in general and with 2009 in particular. I use it to juggle 4 bank accounts, 5 credit cards, and a number of websites I run.

The only bug I've noticed involves importing credit cards. The auto matching entries import without an issue. However if I try to manually reconcile a single entry that has auto imported, it often will do a ""split"" with that entry, with the first line being blank and having the dollar amount, and the second line having the name with no dollar amount. So I have to manually fix those splits each time. I spent a week on the phone with QuickBooks support and they couldn't figure it out. So my only hope now is to wait for 2011 to come out and then give that a try, to see if that fixes the problem.

The biggest changes for me is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.

Norton Security Premium comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

The cloud backup is something use for non-sensitive information only as backup. The identity protection and contact sharing is interesting but are not features I choose to use.

Buying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.

Windows Setup (UPDATED):
If you are using this to try to renew, DON'T follow the directions to activate the product at norton.com/setup. Instead login to your control panel and select renew. Select the option that lets you enter a key you already have (this one). Enter the key and if it is compatible with the version you are renewing this key will supersede the expiring key. One caution: wait till the old one is about to expire before plugging in the key so you don't lose your remaining subscription!

IF you followed the activation directions this will be installed as a separate product subscription and you will need to do the following:

**NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you may need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices).

Installation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Premium very easily and without problems. I registered the product in my existing Norton account to activate 10 devices I could install. The download went smoothly and installation on my Windows 7 desktop was faster than with older CD based Norton products and similar to Norton Security with Backup. I did have to restart my computer.

I found it interesting that the installation branding and the control panel branding is still Norton Security with Backup reinforcing my perception of a simple evolution and mostly branding changes.

The controls in the GUI are simple and clear coming from Norton Security with Backup.  There are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. There is a small gear icon for settings on the main screen of the GUI and many controls are hidden in there.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is continues to be ""noisy"" than pre-2015 versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. It has the same light impact on PC performance as the previous version.  This is a very good thing! The initial full scan came up clean which is no surprise ince I had last year's version installed before this one.

Application Compatibility Problems:

Unlike last year's version I have had no application compatibility problems. Last year's version has issues with VirtualBox. Good news!

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is better than before, but not all that much. It has two features: anti-theft and cloud backup. It does not include any virus protection. The Anti-Theft features include:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 6 a quarter mile away!! Also letting it run GPS in the background significantly reduced my battery life.
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number. If the phone is locked it can't be answered...
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

It has cloud backup (doesn't Apple offer this too?) to backup your contacts and share them.

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:
If you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed and want this to be a renewal, DON'T FOLLOW THE ACTIVATION DIRECTIONS!

If you have gone through norton.com/setup, be sure to remove your device from the Norton control panel and device before installing the new version. I could not find a way to move a device from an old subscription to a new one unless I renewed through the Norton site at a higher price. That's annoying

Because it's a great product for home users, having to reinstall if you buy a new subscription (vs renewing) and the IOS app remains quite limited I'm giving Norton Security Premium 4 stars.

It's clear that Adobe wants to force users to move to CC so they can make a monthly rental fee from you than buying the license.

This is evident from the fact that installation of Windows 7 Professional is trouble-free, and the OS is attractive, easy to figure out, and easy to configure.  It has quickly become a cliche' that Windows 7 is what Vista should have been, but it is also true.  In my installation all of my hardware peripherals (3 printers, a fax, a scanner, and numerous external hard disk drives) installed instantly and easily.  Only one of my printers required me to log onto Hewlett-Packard's website, and right there was a Windows 7 64 bit driver waiting for me.  This is one day after Windows 7 was released to the public -- Microsoft clearly worked closely with hardware developers to ensure that everything was ready to go.  Installation of all hardware went without a hiccup.  In fact, most times when you plug a device into a USB port, Win 7 automatically finds the necessary drivers and simply installs the device.

One caveat -- XP users must do a ""clean install"" from XP to Win 7.  This essentially means that if you skipped Vista (as many did) you will have to install Windows 7 and then reinstall your programs.  I did this, and it was about a two hour exercise getting everything set up the way I wanted again after installing Windows 7 64 bit.

LOOK AND FEEL.

The ""look and feel"" of Windows 7 is better than either Vista or Windows XP.  Unlike Vista, users of XP will have no difficulty finding the screens and menus they are looking for.  The new taskbar in Windows 7 is very sharp.  The user can ""pin"" any program to the taskbar for easy access.  When a program is running, the user can hover the mouse cursor over the program icon, and a mini snapshot of the actual program appears, to show what is going on with the program.  Right click on an icon on the taskbar and it will show you what files have been recently used or are open.  The new so-called ""aero"" styling of Windows 7 is very pleasant to work with.  One nice little feature is a little box at the right bottom screen--hover the mouse over it and the desktop appears without having to minimize all the open programs.

Performance wise, it is not clear that Windows 7 is wildly faster than Vista or XP.  Most users will probably think it is simply because computers are in the midst of an upgrade cycle, with more and more users using more DRAM and faster processors.  And, of course, the issue of 64 bit is emerging.

64 BIT

Windows 7 will likely lead the charge to 64 Bit software.  Windows 7 gives the option of either 32 bit or 64 bit installation, and most users are expected to opt for 64 bit.  They should.  This will not immediately impact most users, but it opens the door for much better performance in the times to come.  64 bit software running on a 64 Bit OS can access far more memory than 32 bit, which was limited to 4 GB of DRAM.  Those of us who manipulate large digital photographs, or use other processes that involve handling large amounts of data, will notice extreme performance improvements once true 64 bit programs are available.  Now that a 64 bit OS is in place, and the accompanying hardware support (fast CPUs, cheap DRAM) is available, 64 bit computing will become common; very likely within a very short time.  As always, once the capability exists, we will find new uses for them.  Digital photographers such as myself have been looking forward to 64 bit applications for a long time.

In the meantime, I have found that every single one of my 32 bit programs runs just fine in Windows 7 64 bit.  Supposedly some legacy programs have difficulties, but none of mine did.

CONCLUSION

After running Windows 7/64 for a couple of weeks, I have found essentially nothing negative about it.  It is snappier than XP, which was starting to get long in the tooth, and seems to have eliminated some of the irritants of Vista.  Most importantly, I am certain that almost all users will find that their hardware works fine on Windows 7, which was not the case with Vista.  Overall, Windows 7 is clearly a major upgrade from Vista and XP and is what Vista was supposed to be.",A home run by Microsoft -- Finally!,1257120000,52,

It simply plugs in and you are done. It uses a cellular signal to broadcast it's location, speed, braking, etc. It does a good job at that.

So why have I knocked a few stars off? Accuracy, I used this solely for a period of 2 weeks, while it was running I had Google Maps with another tracking app open on my phone and monitored my speed real time and over 50% of the reports of speeding were inaccurate when traveling in residential and rural areas, most of the time the speed limit of the road was not marked correctly within the map so it reported a false positive. The device got it right every time on the interstate, but on local roads it consistently said I was speeding when I wasn't, and there was a variance of 10mph in many cases.  Additionally when looking at the ""route replay"" feature on the app my tracks did NOT match the roads on those rural roads, in a few cases I was driving between 2 roads, in a few other cases it had me on the next road over, the accuracy for me was NOT reliable. Perhaps I got a bad unit to test.

This IS useful to get data on your braking and driving, but after my use of this I would highly recommend you NOT use this as the judgement of whether you punish your teen, fire an employee, etc. It's simply not as accurate as it should be in my test scenarios, and I state again, I did these tests solely monitoring my own driving, I was not observing anyone else's driving and then took their word for the results, this was done carefully in different controlled scenarios.","It's a good concept, but 50% of the time I used it in rural and residential areas it was wrong.",1470700800,16,

No grammar, no lessons, etc. Just immerse the student in the language the way a baby is immersed. To be honest, I wasn't aware of that philosophy when I decided to try this out.
The technique is certainly interesting. They do a good job of showing you pictures many times and making you pronounce the word. This package comes with a mic and headphone, although I only used the mic. But when you speak back, the software tells you how well you pronounced the word. That's pretty neat. But occasionally it can get annoying if you think you've pronounced the word correctly and it still says you haven't!

TurboTax imported the data and then ... each time we went back to the summary screen, it showed different numbers. We had to keep exiting and restarting to get back to the correct numbers. Not cool.

This year we are using TurboTax Premier. You already know that they tried an ill-advised change where they removed Schedule C and D from the version that always had them, claiming they ""changed our TurboTax products this year to deliver only the best, guided experience based on your specific tax situation."" You knew this was utter baloney, as they had to spend a good bit of time and money to do the work of extracting existing functions and make them ""optional purchases"" instead. Thankfully your revolt paid off and the genius who came up with that idea is hopefully languishing in a pit of tar and feathers. It's interesting because they had the notion that regular people just don't have investment income.

So, all that aside ... so far, all we can say is it looks pretty much the same. It now includes questions to see if you're penalized for not getting Obamacare. It has that very helpful module for figuring out your charitable deductions. It has that same interview format you may know and, er, love. It makes doing your own taxes less frightening, what with their calculation guarantee and their now included access to tax experts by phone. You can also now import your investments, mortgage info and W-2s from  over one million companies, including the federal government, which is also a time saver.

So, all the hullabaloo about their greedy grab aside, I have to admit it's still a pretty helpful piece of software, when it works.

However, there are still areas where it could improve. Some of the questions are not clear, and some of the consequences of your answers are not clear. One thing they really, really need to add is the ability to drill down and show you how this or that number was derived. Trying to figure out how they came up with some mysterious number can be maddening, especially TurboTax keeps changing it like it did when we tried to do amended returns.

Another improvement would be a clearer explanation of what you're entering, such as the confusion that results if you try to adjust estimated taxes (the number you enter is an adjustment, plus or minus).

Another hiccup we had was in trying out scenarios. What would happen if we added a contribution of X dollars to an IRA? We entered the W2 and other income information, then went to deductions to try this out. We answered some questions. Was this repaying a withdrawal? Were there nondeductible contributions? etc. At the end, TurboTax just said we were not eligible for this deduction, with no explanation, and also that this might change once the return was completed. What??? What else needed to be done for it to be ""completed""? Why might it change? No further information was given. We went back and tried different answers to the questions (as far as they made sense) but got the same result. So here is another scenario where TurboTax mysteriously decides something with no explanation. There was no on-screen info about how to call an expert.

I'd give them 3 stars for adding the phone support (which I have not yet tried, since I will have to find out how to contact them) and general usefulness of the software. I may revise this as I enter more of the tax information that is still trickling in this year.","Greedy grab aside, it's still useful and adds value with phone support ... but still maddening at times",1422835200,,

It supported most any video type I threw at it from multiple camcorders, phones, etc.  The one place it failed were on some AVIs of 8mm films that were encoded with the Cineform codec.  I used my 14-day 1-use support request only to get a semi-english response that said ""sorry it doesn't work with Cineform"".  Beware that support is iffy with this product.  You only get 14 days from the point of install, and only 1 issue.  After that you have to pay.  I wouldn't pay for the support I received.

Realtime preview is ok, but it wants to render things a bit more than I expected.  Particularly with speeding up video, it has to render the scene completely before it'll show any sort of preview.  Rendering 1080 video from my camcorder took a long time, as does exporting to other formats.

One other annoying thing is that it automatically starts searching and importing media files whenever you start up.  Also, the export presets are plentiful, but you can't modify them.  Instead you have to select a custom format, then set it up to do what you want.  There's also no function to specify a specific output type, then specify a maximum size.  For Amazon reviews, you have a 100MB limit.  I couldn't just set output to 99MB and let it choose the bitrate, nor could I easily exclude audio or set it to mono without making a complete custom setting.  Further, when customizing an output format, it wouldn't update the estimated size, so in the end I just had to make changes and export, then hope it fell under the size I was looking for.

As for actual editing, I thought it did pretty well.  Every program has its own learning curve and this one is no different.  As with most programs it has more transitions and effects than I'll ever use.  I also like that this version comes with the live screen capture built in, as that is something I've used other programs for in the past.

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).

The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the ""theme"" chosen. Pretty unexciting.

As far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on ""File"" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.

Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.

Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating.

Robinson,"First of all, I must say that there is a generous amount of learning Spanish materials included with this software. There are3 40 core lessons that are named after situations that learners of the Spanish language are likely to encounter.  For example:

* Checking In
* in the hotel room
* making a long distance call
* at a restaurant
* asking for directions
* finding an address
* Introductions
* at a party
* making an appointment
* at the pharmacy
* at the doctor's office
* at the laundry
* at the gas station
* at the beauty parlor

All 40 of the lessons include the following sections: Vocabulary sections, Vocabulary exercises, Dialogs, Dialogs Exercises, Grammar, Grammar Exercises, and Interactive Conversation.

The software also features ""workshops"" where the student will have the chance to practice in five areas:
Grammar, Pronunciation, Vocabulary, Conversation, and Simulations

The software also has lots of games to help break the monotony of studying Spanish. I have not had a chance to play the games but they seem to consist of crossword puzzles and online games.

This software also includes a ""progress"" section so that you can measure how well you are learning how to speak Spanish.  But one of my favorite sections of the software was the ""tools"" section which allowed me to customize my lessons.  It even allowed me to set my ""minimum achievement level"" which I left at the default (70%). In this section, I was also able to select the lessons based on which was the most important to me to learn. Such as:

1. The Complete Program
2. Everyday Life
3. Business Spanish
4. Travel
5. Going Out
6. Shopping
7. Complete Customization

There was also a very detailed ""help"" section in the software. But I found the software so intuitive that I never had to use it.

My favorite section of the software was the ""media section"" that included short cultural videos and MP3  audio. The videos covered topics such as Mexican Traditions, Advise for Tourists, the National Museum and more. I highly recommend the Learn to Speak Spanish Deluxe  for any beginner student of the language or for anyone who needs to learn basic Spanish for an upcoming trip to a Spanish speaking country. However, if you are an intermediate student, you will not find this software enough of a challenge.

Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Rosetta Stone Spanish.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosetta-Stone-Spanish-Latin-America-Level-1-2-3-4-5-Set-with-Audio-Companion/dp/B00282UXC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosetta Stone  Spanish (Latin America) Level 1,2,3,4 & 5 Set with Audio Companion</a>&nbsp;is pretty good if you are a visual learner like me. My only complaints are that in  Rosetta Stone Spanish the Spanish is rather basic and the course is excessively expensive.

In order to speak Spanish fluently, you must also learn lots of new words.

The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I will use daily until I reach fluency.

I've been using the demo for about last month or so on my other computer, thinking that the final product would be different and polished, but it is not.  As I installed it, I realized that it's pretty much the same thing.  It did prompt me for 15 updates, so looks like if you are getting this now, get ready for a lot of these off the bat.  For some reason, I keep getting UAC popups pretty much for every action that I do.  I had to turn the UAC notifications off, but now I don't feel safe.  The whole installation took about half an hour(I picked the option to move as much of my old stuff as possible.)

Yes, you can go to your old desktop by pressing the WINDOWS key, but you will feel a bit lost without your trust old friend ""The Start Button.""  Of course you can still use your mouse to navigate, but a lot of actions require you to go to the edge of the screen and it could be tough to ""catch"" it.

Not everything about W8 I found is bad.  The Metro Interface is an eye-pleaser and with (hopefully) more apps on the way, I'll use it more in the future.  For now, Skype looks pretty good as an app.  System does boot faster and feels faster.

You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October. If you are updating from Leopard, Apple has continued to make it inexpensive for a family using more than one machine by pricing the upgrade at about $10.00 a machine (assuming you use all five). Not bad.

So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.

Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:

1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode

2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.

3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time

4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard

5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.

6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%

(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google ""Snow Leopard Performance"")

Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.

Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.

The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder.

*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****

A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:

1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.

2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.

3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.

4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.

A MAJOR complaint:

1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.

A Minor complaint:

1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.

*****End of update*****

Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!",More than meets the eye,1251417600,41,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UZLAFQPSL._SY88.jpg']

A few months ago, I bought a copy of Office 2010 Home and Student at Costco for cheap, and I was really, and pleasantly, surprised at how easy the ribbons interface turned out to be.  I soon became completely converted to the new interface.

If you're already using any version before 2007 and find it adequate for your needs, there's still little reason to upgrade. Even more so for the 2007 version users. For me, the biggest improvement is Excel 2010, which, in its 64-bit version, supports billions of rows and hundreds of millions of column. This makes 64-bit Excel an extremely powerful number cruncher.  In my quest to find a profitable stock trading system, I work with tons of tick data, and now I can ditch the expensive specialized software (which I have to pay for on a subscription basis) and use Excel instead. Excel also has all the functions I need for stock analysis, so it's perfect.

Of course, if all you need are Word, Excel and Powerpoint, the Home and Student edition costs just 100 bucks and lets you install on up to three (3) computers, which makes it a great deal.  But if you need Access or Outlook, then a more expensive package is needed.  If you do need the software, it's worth every penny, because you can be really productive, and you can probably use the software to make money, too, unlike, say, the $600 you spend on an iPhone or iPad which is just a toy (and apps cost you money faster than you realize).

I installed the professional version on my Toshiba laptop with an Intel i7 quad processor and 4GB of RAM. (I first uninstalled the 2007 trial version that had come with the laptop.) Installation went smoothly. The individual apps in the suite launch quickly, and I realy like the new Outlook (I was a big user of Outlook 2003). All my old Outlook files opened without any problem (as expected), and I think I'm now even more productive than before.

I'm in the middle of storing my tick data in Access and then reading them into Excel for number crunching.  I'm not good at Access, so that'll keep me busy for a few weeks to come.  Like I said, I'm excited at the prospect of finding a profitable trading system via Excel; at least, I'm now able to save hundreds of dollars each year, and be able to use a tool that's faster and easier to maintain than before.

Again, if you only need Word, Excel and Powerpoint (and OneNote), go with the Home and Student edition. You can even buy individual apps separately.

I, of course, uninstalled McAfee first, before trying to install Kaspersky, only to be told there was still something left on the PC by McAfee, that was blocking the installation of Kaspersky.  That sort of thing makes me cringe!  I then went to ""techincal assistance"" or whatever it was called, on the Kaspersky CD, and immediately saw a question about what to do if a third party security system was blocking installation. Clicking that in, I discovered there were tools for McAfee, Norton's, etc. to remove the problem file. Clicking in McAfee took me to the McAfee file, which I opened, and that started the removal process.

After then going back to installing Kaspersky, I got my old friend Error 1500. That has nothing to do with the Kaspersky software, and everything to do with my PC or Vista.  (For the solution to that error, please read my review of Corel Photo Album 7.) After fixing the Error 1500 problem, Kaspersky installed immediately.  I then had to update, since this version of the software is so old.  That went quickly also, thought I was hooked up to my sister's high speed router, and not my usual dial-up connection...so, I don't know how fast or slow the update would have been with dial-up. Next, I did a full scan, and Kaspersky found 4 infected files with something ""very dangerous"" in them.

Two weeks later, the daily updates for Kaspersky install very quickly, even on dial-up.  And they don't slow down my PC.  McAfee's updates slowed down my PC, and sometimes they were so long, I had to go hook up my laptop to my sister's high speed router to do them.  McAfee had a maintenance feature, though, and this version of Kaspersky does not; so, I'm going to have to remember to start doing maintenance PC stuff now.  Also, interestingly, Kaspersky does not have a firewall, although it does have spyware protection.  Thus, you must use your Windows firewall, which is fine with me...as long as I don't have to use Windows Defender!

The interface changed at 4 and is the same interface in 5, so I'm at least thankful that I don't have to learn a whole new interface again.

PROS

-I still think PaintShop is the best program around for non-pros who still care about their photos. In other words, it's more advanced than most amateur programs, without quite the same editing capabilities as PhotoShop-- but PhotoShop is much harder to learn.

-It does a good job with basic editing-- simple to crop, adjust brightness, fix blemishes, etc.

-Some great photo effects-- I'm really enjoying playing around with ""film and filters,"" Time Machine, and selective focus, but there are lots more to play with.

-If you don't own any good photo editing programs, you might as well start with X5.

-Great price for such a powerful piece of software.

CONS

-No printed manual

-Red eye removal, while still better than most programs of this type, still needs improvement-- you can generally tell that something's been ""red-eye-removed."" It's no better in version 5 than in version 4.

-Same with the ""One-Step Photo Fix"" command, which is useless. Everything comes out almost very high contrast with too-bright colors. Same as version 4.

-Glitchy. This is where it went from 4 stars to 3... When I open a new photo, it automatically brings it into ""edit"" mode. If I then try to go to ""adjust"" mode, my photo vanishes, never to be seen again. I swear. Even if I go back to ""edit"" mode, my photo is gone. I haven't figured out a fix for this yet. I'm using Windows 8 on a great new machine and will ask customer service what's up.

-When you use the FB ""share"" button, it automatically uploads it as public. If you want your photos to be private, you then have to go to Facebook and change their privacy settings. At that point, you might as well just upload directly from FB rather than from PaintShop.

I've used Roxio software on my PC for years so when I changed to Mac, Toast was a logical app for me to look at.  It's been the standard for years on the Mac.  While some Apple apps have the ability to write to CD/DVD, their capability is limited.  Toast is the most complete, do it all app for the Mac.

First, let's talk about what it can't do... copy commercial movie DVDs.  Toast will not copy DVDs that are copy protected (most commercial movie DVDs). While it may make a copy, it will be unplayable or unwatchable.

But, Toast does almost everything else you might want to do with making DVDs and CDs...  copying, making archive files (ISO, IMG, etc), authoring DVD (making menus,menu screens, adding backgrounds,etc).  It can also take videos and movies and optimize (compress) them for best performance on tablets and phones, upload them to social sites, and let you do light editing.  By light editing, I'm referring to taking clips and combining them.  For more comprehensive editing, you can use iMovie (free) or one of many commercial apps.  Toast also handles audio files.  It can read most file types and convert them if needed to other types.  It comes with a program that allows you to edit and clean up audio. While not as feature laden as some apps, it does most of the things you would need to do.

If you purchase this and are going to install it on a Mac running El Capitan (latest OS), my suggestion is not to use the DVD that came in the box.  The box I received had a slightly older version that has some issues with El Capitan.  Roxio allows you to download and install the app from their website. When you do that you get the latest version. It also makes installation on the newer MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs (no DVD drive) easy.

So far the software has performed well.  I only have 2 complaints... sometimes certain features are hard to find.  I wanted to save a DVD to an ISO file.  By default, Toasts save an image to it's own filetype.  It took me a while to find out how to save it to an ISO file.  It's not as intuitive as Roxio's PC software (Creator).  This was the case with a couple of things I tried to do.  I also had a problem once installing it.  I installed it when I first got it and everything went fine.  About a month later, I changed the drive in my Mac and reinstalled everything.  The only software that didn't work was Toast.  It activated and appeared to work, but would hang when I actually tried to write a file or DVD.  I uninstalled it and did a reinstall and it's been working fine... probably just an anomaly.  Toast does not have an uninstall option or program. However they have good instructions on their website.

Even with a few problems, I will continue to use Toast and see it as the best app of it's type for the Mac.",Roxio Toast - the standard for DVD/CD burning software on the Mac,1450396800,,

Buying antivirus software is one of the most dreaded computer-related task most people face  just reading the daily headlines reinforces that computer hacking is real and proper protection is necessary.  You want to make the right choice in buying antivirus software but there seem to be so many negative horror stories about antivirus software.  Heres why I ended up with Webroot.

The first thing I want to share is that I have been buying antivirus software for over 20 years, for business and home, and I am not married to any one brand. In fact, over time, I have bought and used nearly every brand sold.  And yes, some of them were true horror stories.

When WIN 10 came along I made the decision not to add any third-party protection at all to what is already part of the WIN 10 suite (Windows Defender).  While most independent experts agree that Defender isn't the best solution out there, they also agree that it is good enough for most people who use their computer for casual everyday use.  Defender has the huge benefit that it has almost no negative impact on computer speed or performance and it works totally in the background and never nags or bugs you (unless there is a reason to alert you to a problem). Another major benefit of Defender is that is updates itself (in the background) so you are always assured of being protected against the latest threats.

IF you want to add more protection to your computer but you like the positive benefits of Defender, Webroot is one of the best options out there.

SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. Unlike most software there isn't really an old or new version of Webroot.  As long as you are running one that is compatible with your computers operating system Webroot works like Defender in that it is really merely an interface to their online services where all the actual smarts are located.  That is why Webroot won't work unless you are online.  You don't have to worry about updating to a new version each year or doing periodic downloads because (as Webroot calls it) it is always up to date.

2. Because Webroot doesnt install a large number of files directly on to your computer, it utilizes very little of your computers resources, thus most people will probably never notice any difference in computer speed or performance.

3. When the term of your license runs out you don't have to buy a new disc and reinstall the program. Buying a new license just allows the software to continue to run for another year (or whatever the term of your license is).  There is good news and bad news in that. The makers of Webroot don't seem to have figured out how to reward existing customers who want to renew their license. Instead, when their offer is sent to you as your license is about to expire their special price is ridiculously high. I mean all they're doing is giving you permission to use their software for another year, you would think they would/could offer you a special price for you loyalty, but no.  Which forces people like me to simply buy a whole new disc from whoever has it on sale for the best price at the time. Fortunately my renewal time is around Black Friday each year and I am able to buy a whole new disc for peanuts.

4. People who review Webroot usually have mostly positive things to say (except for the license renewal issue discussed above) but too many of them mention how Webroot has a nag box that appears on your screen every time you turn your computer on. Not true, or at least not fully true.  Yes that will happen, but all you have to do is uncheck that feature in the advanced settings box and you will never see any messages from Webroot unless you have an intrusion alert (or your license is about to expire).  The fact that Webroot doesnt have nag boxes is one of the major reasons I prefer it over Brands X, Y and Z.

5. When you first install Webroot it does a quick scan and tells you your computer is safe. Dont believe it. The FIRST thing you should do is force a deep scan. Webroot makes doing that harder to find than most of their competitors. To do a deep scan, open you file manager (the screen that shows you your hard drives) and right-click on each available drive, starting with your boot drive (usually your C drive) and choose Scan with Webroot.  Then sit back, the deep scan will take a long time, depending on how full your drive is and how fast it accesses files it can take up to a couple of hours.  There will be a dialogue box with a progress bar, how many threats were detected, elapsed time, etc.  Its best not to do anything else (multitask) at the same time until the scan is completed.

BOTTOM LINE

This is the third consecutive year Ive made the conscious decision to choose Webroot over other brands of antivirus software.  In that time Ive never had a virus infect my computers, Ive never noticed a slowdown of my computers performance, Ive never been annoyed by needless advertising popups, and Ive been able to protect 3 devices for a full year for about five-cents a day.

Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill was the first game ever created in the series-and it shows. It is definitely the worst in the series, but it still is able to give quite a fun gaming experience.

Story-The story is that your Aunt Eloise (who is the librarian at a high school) has asked you to come help solve a murder. A boy was pushed down a flight of stairs, and it's your job to find out who did it. It's a very generic story, and it really isn't developed as much as it could have been.

Graphics-They aren't good at all compared to today's graphics, but in the '90s, they were awesome. The backgrounds are 3D, somewhat, but they are VERY grainy. Still, they are done quite well. The characters in this game are cartoon characters and are slightly disappointing visually.

Sound-The music is nice in the game and sets a mysterious mood over the game. The voice acting isn't really good at all, but the background sounds are very nicely done.

Gameplay-This is a first-person point-and-click game. You simply click arrows to determine your direction. This game is a little strange in the fact that at some locations you can look up or down slightly for no apparent reason, but otherwise, it's not too hard to figure out. The puzzles in the game are fairly easy and don't require too much thought. They are mostly just finding objects to interact with other objects later in the game. You can call your friends in order to get hints, but all they do is give you a hint before hanging up; in other words, unlike other games, you cannot have conversations with your friends on the phone. Probably the most annoying aspect of the game is that you have to continuously switch discs as you switch locations in the game, which can be quite annoying.

Fun-It was fun, but it really doesn't have replay value as the others in the series do. It's too boring. It wasn't scary at all, but you can die in the game. If you do, you press second chance and you go back to the scene right before you died.

Length-It seriously took me 3 hours to play and finish. And the constant disc changing factor probably took 20 minutes of that time. It's not long at all.

I recommend this game to fans who are waiting for the next game to come out, but only if you can get it cheap. It's fun, but it is short, and it is a one time thing.

My first experience with the Dragon software was probably about ten years ago.  At that early stage voice dictation was more of a novelty than a professional work flow.  Things have improved exponentially since, and this version impressed me with its accurate recognition (after training of course).

Before you get started the software needs to be ""trained"" to your voice.  And while the training process has improved, it will still take some time to get it accurately interpreting your voice.  Account for that during the installation process as it will take an hour or two to get everything tweaked and adjusted.  Is the accuracy perfect?  Definitely not, but it's pretty close.  I tend to be a fast talker but Dragon was able to keep up most of the time.  Corrections are easy too.

Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.

Just ONE Please...:
This item has licensing for just ONE Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) or Android device. If you ONLY have one device this is fine, but if you have even two you are much better getting the 5 device version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security/dp/B00MHZ6Z64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security</a>&nbsp;or 10 device&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;which should be enough for many families.

Whether you get the 1, 5 or 10 device license version it is the same product. Depending on the device there are differing feature sets. For example, IOS devices get no antivirus. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Windows Setup:
Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is hard to find in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me until I finally found it deep in the settings.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:
I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox was unable to start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). This virtual machine is critical to my business so I was happy to finally resolve this. This is the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.

NOTE: As of Late February Virtual Box seems to work fine again with the mainstream releases IF you disable Norton Security during installation.

How About Norton Security WITH Backup:
If you want an integrated on-line backup solution or have more than 5 devices, you might want to consider getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;it supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. The difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.

Mobile Support:
The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a over a mile away from its actual location!!
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number...
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty poor. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:
This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good overall but has some issues. It finds things other antivirus solutions on my Windows 7 Pro PC did not and does not seem to slow things down for me. I had one application with a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but buries the advanced controls deep in the settings.

Overall Norton Security should be a good tradeoff for most home users.

The ONE device license is not a bargain. These days, who has just one device?

The software itself is a great product for most people. If you have more than 1 device get the 5 device version or the 10 device version if more than 5 or you want backup too.

Because of the minor issues and relatively poor value compared to the multi-device Norton Security versions I'm giving Norton Security for 1 device just 3 stars.

Hope this helps someone.","Expensive, Next Gen Norton, Catches MALWARE Others Missed, Very Limited IOS App",1416700800,,

Cons: After using this a couple times I found that it increased my computer's ""boot up"" time to over 2 minutes longer than it was.  Most spy-ware or scanning devices have the same problem, so I don't see anything here that makes it stand out from any other software. I have to turn ""Intelligard"" off completely to do any web surfing.  I didn't pay for DSL so I could have my browser slowed to a crawl by the PC tools program.

There is also no easy way to uninstall it!  It won't show up on my list of programs on the control panel, nor are there any instructions in the help files on how to get rid of it.  So, in a way, this PC Tools program has become like the things it is supposed to be protecting my computer from!  It takes up memory and I can't get rid of it.

Pros: It's easy to use, and gives you options as to what you might want to delete versus not.  It describes the risk level and type of risk, even offers to save a ""go back"" point/version in case you decide you deleted something you shouldn't have, and need to ""go back.""  Keeps a history file so you can see later what was removed.

I liked the option of having it automatically download and install updates without my having to affirm window after window in order to do so.  I also like that I can use it on up to three computers at home.

It didn't hog up a ton of memory on my hard drive.  It found several things that Norton and McAfee missed.  I had tried ""ad-aware"" but that program only caused more problems than it helped- (buggy, slow, incomplete coverage, etc.)

If you are an advanced Mac user, you probably won't need this product. Go with a dedicated and strong anti-virus instead. Most of Trend Smart Surfing's features are better provided elsewhere, such as at the hardware router/firewall level, which you can configure to provide stronger protection across your entire home network. With a good router/firewall, all your networked devices are centrally protected and can be managed at a single point of entry (through the router's web admin interface), instead of having to be installed and configured one computer at a time when you go with a software protector. This product can work in tandem with a well-configured router/firewall, but if you already have website filtering rules on your router and other security features enabled, Smart Surfing becomes redundant.

Problems:
---------

There is no separate admin password for this software, so if you intend to use this to protect your kids, you may wish to think twice. The password is linked to the Mac's system password. If your kids have the password, they can turn this off. Worse still is that this software provides step-by-step instructions when it blocks a site on how to turn OFF the blocking, instead of a simple ""Access Denied"" message.

As for the malicious website blocking/phishing protection, I never encountered it being triggered, except for pop-ups from one ad network ([...]). I tried a variety of ""normal"" sites as well as some adult ones and warez serial number sites. Nothing. Modern email providers such as Yahoo and Google automatically filter out spam and other malicious emails, so I could not test the anti-phishing feature. I did not have any phishing sites to try out. Google has also been providing a phishing block for a while now.

As for virus protection, it is unclear if this product is an anti-virus/virus scanner. I believe it is not. The description is vague about this, perhaps intentionally: ""Defends against viruses, worms, Trojan horse programs, and other everyday security threats."" File scanning appears to be very slow.

Conclusion:
-----------

For casual users, this product is probably ok, but there is no substitute for safe web usage habits and awareness of personal data security. It does not take a lot to be informed about how to stay safe, and there is no better remedy than knowledge. Know what phishing scams, spoof emails, and malicious attachments/links look like. When in doubt, do not click any links or attachments in emails or IM's, even if they are from people you know. Usernames and emails can be easily compromised or spoofed. If you have children, lock them down at the router level and set up filtering rules there.

The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).

The Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.

In its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.

When you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's ""search"" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy ""Virtual Notecards"". Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.

The new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.

Perhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.

Regrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.

Speaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.

The Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.

The Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.

The Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community.

The Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the ""Personal Brain"" to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.

The Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, ""how to"" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.

Ironically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).

Still, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.

The current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.

The Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.

Some minor gripes:

The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?

Despite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.

But that's it. Don't think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannica's Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now. It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate). For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom.

With the demise of Microsoft's Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference.

Just seemed like a lot of work and money for something that naturally would go to the other person should something happen (or so I thought).

Then we had a child and our priorities changed. What would happen to her if we both should die? Who would take care of her? Would she automatically acquire our assets? These, and many other questions, flooded my mind.

So I did some research, and what I found surprised me (quoted from BabyCenter):

1) ""If you die without a valid will, state laws require that your property be divided according to a fairly inflexible formula. In most states your spouse, if you have one, would receive only about one-third to one-half of your estate. The rest would be earmarked for your children.""

2) ""In some states a state-appointed administrator (who charges fees for the service) would control your children's money until each child turned 18. And even if the courts decided that your spouse could hold the funds earmarked for your children in trust, he or she would have to supply the court with an accounting of how the money is used each year.""

3) ""If you and your partner both died without a will, the state courts and social services department would appoint someone to raise your children. And that person might have very different ideas about parenting than you do.""

This more than gave me pause for concern. I couldn't wait any longer. I needed a will. But did I really want to talk to a lawyer?

That's when I came across Quicken WillMaker Plus 2012. As a TurboTax user, I found that WillMaker Plus worked similarly, with a wizard prompting one question at a time while offering advice. It wasn't too painful, but it did beg some questions I never thought about: such as who's going to take care of our pets? Do I want an executor? Who do I want to pull my plug should I become a vegetable? For that matter, do I want the plug pulled? Where do I want to be buried? Cremated?

After more positively motivating questions and thoughts, I finally finished. Next I created one for my wife (you can combine your assets with your spouse, but not your medical, so I just made two fully separate Wills). She had named different individuals in some cases for decision making anyway.

From there you print it out, have two witness or a notary sign them, and then make sure your executor (or lawyer or whoever) has access to it.

But as a long time user of Dragon, the updates aren't exactly mind blowing.  The Dragon toolbar, the better integration with apps, etc. is all fine and good but it's just slight.  The only compelling reason I've found is that the Windows 8 computer seems to work better somewhat.  But if you're using Dragon 12 on Windows 8 fine then you probably aren't using the features that you'd notice.

If you're totally new to Dragon NaturallySpeaking, it's an excellent piece of software that will translate your words into text.  The newest versions even allow mouse control.  (I know that 12 also did this.)  So you can go totally hands-free.  Just find a quiet space to work, configure it to your voice and away you go without using your hands at all.  I do find that it's easier to do without others in the room and I have not had great experiences trying the software on the bus/train/coffee shop.  Plus talking to your computer does tend to make others stare at you.  But at home or in an office it's great.  I've also been able to record to a recorder and then input into Dragon, but it's less successful than live voice into Dragon.  I've tried a few recorders and it always suffers from ambient sound noise.  A laptop just seems to work better for me than recorders.

I've used this software for dozens of setups for those with disabilities and injuries.  It's amazing how productive you can be without the use of your hands.  A very, very small investment to save your wrists.  And you really don't have to tweak this version much at all to get it to recognize your voice.  I really love it.  One key is to use an accurate microphone.  I use the Sennheiser ME 3-EW headset EW microphone http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-ME-3-EW-headset-microphone/dp/B002FOFW52/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1410457352&sr=8-16&keywords=dragon+microphone right now and it's great.  But there are cheaper alternatives that appear to be just as good.

Basically Dragon is very similar to Adobe Acrobat Pro in that it's a wonderful application that works.  But it's not one that you really need to upgrade every year.  If you aren't using Dragon now and want hands-free computing then this is what you need.  I will say that I've always found the Premium version to be worth the extra investment, no matter what version I got.  The Home versions are just too limited IMHO.

No software can do the hard work for you of training your brain to recognize sounds, training your tongue to make them, and learning an entirely new set of vocabulary. But Rosetta Stone tries to make this process fun, intuitive, and simple. When you are trying to do something as difficult as learning another language, you don't need other difficulties thrown in your path. Attending a traditional class--driving, reading books, studying flash cards, interacting with other people who know the language just as poorly as you do--in my opinion introduces many more difficulties into the language learning process and is the cause of many people's failure to advance. If this is you, I recommend Rosetta Stone, which will allow you to advance beyond beginner level in a language in the comfort of your own home, using your own computer and the provided headset and microphone. When compared with the cost of taking a traditional course along with drive time and cost of books, Rosetta Stone's value becomes apparent.

Rosetta Stone is fun. At times, it can feel like a video game. The program does a good job of continuously challenging both your vocabulary and your tongue (as you have to pronounce the words more or less accurately) without being so difficult as to be dishearteningly discouraging.

Rosetta Stone immediately immerses the learner in the world of the language trying to make you forget your mother tongue (in my case English) as much as possible as you learn. This is, as far as I can tell, the best way to make oneself truly fluent. It is the way that I learned Spanish (total immersion), and in my opinion Rosetta Stone does as good of a job of that in a computer setting as I could imagine using today's technology.

I recommend purchasing levels 1, 2, & 3 together in a set so that you can advance far enough to actually begin intelligent conversations with native speakers. Rosetta Stone will only be able to advance you to a point, getting you out of beginner status. But to move on from there to fluent, will most definitely require surrounding yourself with people who speak the target language. But I am aware of no better value than Rosetta Stone to make that transition into another culture and language possible. I am looking forward to taking the next step.

I do have  word of caution from my experience regarding Windows Vista 64-bit software and Rosetta Stone's technical support. I was able to ""successfully"" install the software but unable to load any of the language modules into the software. After multiple calls (3+ hours) to technical support with a wide range of suggestions, I was finally told that Rosetta Stone is not supported on Vista 64 bit. This is somewhat frustrating and will likely be an issue more many purchasers of newer computers. I have read in reviews and blogs that some have been able to make it work, but I was unable to. I ended up having to install it on a secondary (and older) computer system. This was an inconvenience and something that I personally feel is an inexcusable oversight for high-end software. For lack of 64-bit support and the slowness of technical support to identify this issue, I have dropped my rating of the software from 5 stars to 4 stars.",Excellent Value & Way to Learn a Language; Warning About 64-Bit Windows Vista,1239840000,3,

Both ""my other half"" and I have used Rosetta Stone in the past. We both constructed a foundation for Japanese using these products (and then reinforced it with an intermediate college class). Likewise, as a professor, I was able to test the Rosetta Stone English series. I was astonished at how very intuitive the software was (and the manner in which it integrated the best approaches to ESL that I knew). Therefore, when we spotted this new reading product, we were very hopeful.

As always, Rosetta Stone's years of expertise are evident in this reading package. Like all Rosetta Stone software, the experience never feels like ""work"" for the little ones. And, while the price seems a little heavy, do know that the there are fifty individual exercise and a vast array of activities. All are age appropriate, child-friendly, and rendered in lovely detail. Every single aspect of this program (which you may find your child referring to as a ""game"" ... which is ideal!) encourages literacy BUT in a truly exciting, delightful manner.

We encountered no bugs. This has clearly been closely beta-tested.

Finally, we also love that this software encourages the positive, educational use of technology. Denying children technology isn't pragmatic ... it leaves them at a significant disadvantage when they begin formal schooling. Therefore, this offers yet one more outstanding experience for young ones.

Everything about this software is carefully created, family friendly, and deeply educational. Do not hesitate to invest this new Rosetta Stone reading package.",The Quality You Have Grown to Expect in Rosetta Stone ...,1416441600,3,

Bess and George's Aunt Bet have chucked their life in Phoenix and bought Shadow Ranch. Now a phantom horse is appearing at night, heralding major accidents. Just before Nancy arrives, for example, Bess's uncle is bit by a rattlesnake and rushed to the hospital. What's going on here?

Suspects include cook Shorty Thurmond, store owner Mary Yazzie, and ranch hands Tex and Dave.

Fun fact - Mary Yazzie's character was named Mary Deer in the book. I don't know why they changed it.

By this point in the series, I was looking for something meatier than yet another tale of buried treasure and phantom animals.

The story is just too dang engaging to be ignored, though. Plus there are horses. Horses count for a lot in my book.

Puzzles: A -

Puzzles included everything from baking a cake to solving a little metal maze. The maze drove me insane.

One puzzle in particular made me roll my eyes because the way you find the solution is utterly dumb. You're looking for a really old piece of information, and Bess and George, stuck at the airport, happen to find a book that contains exactly what you need to know. And by old, I mean like a hundred years old. It was so contrived. Then again, I couldn't think of anything better, either.

Gameplay: A +

The new game interface features a wider screen and an inventory you have to open to access. I thought the wide screen was great but the extra clicking irritated me, because if you may miss the little button to close it or change pages. You get used to it, though.

Western life comes alive at Shadow Ranch, where you repair the chicken coop, perform daily tasks and always take care of your horse when you get back to the stable or Tex will have something to say to you!

Other fun in the game includes invesitgating a ghost town, learning to use a lariat (lasso) and completing a barrel race in under ten seconds.

You know how I said that DDI has everything but romance? Shadow Ranch has romance in spades. It's divine.

Time Changes: This one takes place in three days. When you complete the tasks for a certain day, it will automatically change to night.

Voice Acting: A

Raspy-voiced grump Tex sounds a lot like grumpy Red Knott from GDML (same voice actor) but it was nice to hear him again, like a phone call from an old friend. Many of the voice actors hear have appeared in other games, so it's a treat for a long-time fan. Superlative delivery, as always.

I faithfully owned every version of Money Microsoft produced and then they did an end of life on there software so I switched to Quicken. Well then I got a mac and went to quicken for mac and it was nice. I used Quicken 2007 for mac for several years and finally Quicken came out with what they called ""Quicken Essentials"" which was just a useless program. They stripped out most the useful features, etc. So I downgraded back to Quicken 2007 as my primary finance tool and in parallel started playing with iBank. iBank is NOT as ""pretty"" as Quicken 2007 was which is sort of sad to say. But the software does everything I need it to do. Then when Apple announced OSX Lion and Quicken announced Quicken 2007 would not work well that just sealed the deal. I left quicken 2007 and have been using iBank 4. I've used iBank for probably 3 months now off and on and the last 2 weeks daily as my primary tool. It was a slow transition  as I wanted to get used to it slowly before I upgraded to Lion.

What I like is it works. It's simple and the web connect download of transactions is super fast. Quicken used to take a long time to download my transactions, iBank is a meere matter of seconds.

iBank also has the one feature most other software is missing, the cash flow forecast. A vital tool with how I do my budgets.

iBank is NOT the most polished piece of software I've ever used. But given the limited finance software on the mac it really is the best. Plus if you use the add-on iphone app and sync your data to it, you have one more way to keep track of your money. The app is a few bucks in the app store but it is worth it.

I'm happy with this, I wish they would fix some graphic issues, make the forecast chart look better, but that's really the only complaint I have and that's minor.

If you need finance software I recommend you download a trial version of this software from the developers website at iggsoftware and then if you like it enough to buy it, get it here on amazon as it is cheaper then buying it straight from the developer or the apple app store.","Is it the ultimate solution?
