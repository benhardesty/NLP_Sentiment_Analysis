While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.

I can also tell you, however, that Premier probably isn't worth it for the vast majority of people, even if they have investments. The basic version will still allow you to fill out capital gains sheets. The only thing this really gives you is the ability to better handle rental property and gives you tools to value and maximize deductions. If you have a home business that doesn't have employees (and thus no payroll taxes) you can also get by with Deluxe, instead of Home Business. They don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with Premier and Home Business. It's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. They can't actually remove the ability for you to file your required personal taxes and so all versions have all the forms available. The main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.

My recommendation is that you save some money and start with Deluxe or Basic. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns. My guess is that you won't ever have to, however.","Very good software, but you probably should consider buying Deluxe and upgrade only if neccesary",1451433600,255.0,

Well, for the money it is a good basic tool to help you learn Spanish vocabulary.  I have worked with Rosetta Stone language software and don't think this is as structured of courses, but for the price, who can complain.  This software teaches you the vocabulary and phrases.  I did not find the advance conversation lessons to helpful, as I think the samples were talking to quickly---especially if you are someone just learning the language, you need it to be SLOW.

However, AutoCAD is a beefy program and is not something you can just hop into and get some small projects done. I would recommend this if you are going to be doing some heavy work with it, and not for a hobby unless you are really into making technical drawings and designs.

So, I am more of a technical guy and like programs that don't try to turn everything into some happy friendly wizard. So, I found parts of AutoCAD LT 2011 to be very awesome because they were right there for you to use, but not in the way or annoying. However, I kind of found the awkward MS Office-like menu at the top to be a bit odd. I am not really fond of that style yet, and kind of prefer the old fashioned less ""friendly"" raw menu systems. However, it appears that AutoCAD is going to push this new system through, so even though you should be able to go back to the old style, it gives me the feeling that you better get used to it now because future versions will only feature this cheesy new ""ribbon"" menu system. I would prefer the traditional menu structure be always available, and the default.

The software itself is very in-depth. If you are professionally drawing out plans, then this will be a very useful tool. If you are familiar with AutoCAD software, then you should be able to use it without much more than some annoying menu changes that you will have to get used to. If you are new to this software, or have only used alternative programs, you will likely want to pick up a book and look for some tutorials online. It is a hefty piece of software, but learning how to use it will be very beneficial. I had to knock off a star because of the menu though.

I spent at least 40 minutes training it the first session, then I did additional trainings and it never was quite right. The commands seemed hard to implement on the fly. I figured that version 11--and the Home version at that--wouldn't be that much improvement.

I was so wrong. It feels like a completely different process than my first try. I installed the program, clicked on a few settings, and did a quick medium difficulty reading (JFK's Inaugural Speech) to train the software.

I did 1500 words in half the time it takes me to type. I had to fix a couple blatant mistakes; I left a couple small errors to fix later (my typing usually has more errors).

Having used Corel's software in the past, I looked forward to trying VideoStudio Pro X6.

I've never edited video before and I've also never had a video camera before. I am very proficient with technology and computers, as my career is in IT. Based on past experience with other Corel products, I expected VideoStudio Pro X6 to be a bit more intuitive than it has been so far. Again, I am a complete novice at video editing, so perhaps this is part of a learning curve for me. Until I've had more time to learn and experiment, I'm giving the software a neutral rating while I tell you what I have experienced already.

The install went very smoothly. I put it on my laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate with 16 GB of Ram and an i7 processor. Launching the software is also smooth and the software doesn't take long to load on my PC.

Corel presents you with a mini help window when you first launch the software. The `Home' tab has information and links to helpful items, including a link to check for software updates. The `Learn' tab has helpful training videos. The `Do More' tab has a number of downloadable add-ons, many of which are free. And the last tab is for `Messages'.

There are also very thorough user guides you can download from their website. Normally, I find most software easy to figure out and refer to such manuals for extra tips and information I couldn't figure out on my own. It is apparent I will need to go through this one page by page to learn how to use this software. It would be nice if they had some tutorials that took you through various tasks step by step. There may be such but I haven't found them yet if there are.

So far, I've been able to get video clips into a project, although that took quite a bit of time for me to learn. The import function I found in the `Capture' area does not work as I had expected it to. Now that I have a video clip in the software to work with, I'm working on learning how to edit it and in what ways it can be modified.

As I said before, I am granting it a neutral 3-star rating for now. I had expected this software to be more intuitive - I've had no trouble learning Corel's photo editing software. Once I've worked with the software a bit more, I will adjust my rating however it is warranted and add the new experiences to my review.

Microsoft decided to no longer include Windows Media Center as part of Windows 8.

If you are updating from Windows XP, I recommend that you find a Windows 7 Upgrade package rather than install Windows 8.1 on your computer.

The all in one approach will make some power users and early adapters happy, but an every day user who just wants to run multiple applications in actual windows (instead of awkward full-screen apps), including MS Office, email, and dozens of other programs will be much happier with Windows 7.

Windows 8.1 is a bit friendlier than Windows 8, but it is still an operating system that gives the user an awkward desktop interface instead of a classic start menu and takes away the valuable feature of Windows Media Center only to charge you an additional 99 dollars to get it back by buying Windows 8 Pro Pack.

UPDATED INFORMATION: Below are quotes from a CNET review of Windows 8.1 concerning the tiles, the start button and the classic Windows 7 interface as well as their observation about Windows 7 vs Windows 8.1:

""The split between the touch-friendly tiles and throwback desktop mode is still awkward, and the OS is hard to use without a touch screen. While welcome, the new Start button doesn't behave like the classic version...""

""What you're left with is an OS that still feels like an awkward compromise between the traditional ""desktop"" Windows and the touch-centric, tablet-optimized future that looks and feels exactly like Windows Phone.""

""If you have a legacy Windows 7 system and haven't taken the Windows 8 plunge yet, there's still no reason to.""

Full review is at [...]

If Microsoft were to restore the option for the classic start menu and include Windows Media Center as part of the operating system, I would be inclined to recommend Windows 8.1 as an operating system that I would use.  However, in its current state, I must agree with CNET that if you have a legacy Windows 7 system and haven't taken the Windows 8 plunge yet, there is still no compelling reason to do so based on the changes in Windows 8.1.

UPDATE December 3, 2013:  As of November 30th, here is the breakdown of Microsoft operating systems in use:

*Windows 7  46.64 percent of pc's
*Windows XP  31.22 percent of pc's
*Windows 8  6.66 percent of pc's
*Windows Vista  3.57 percent of pc's
*Windows 8.1  2.64 percent of pc's

Windows 8.1 is faster and has some improved security features over Windows 7. However, as you can see, even Windows Vista has a larger installed share of the market than Windows 8.1 as of November 30, 2013.  Windows customers are waiting for Microsoft to give them a choice of whether they want to use the tablet (tiled) interface or a fully functioning desktop O/S complete with a start menu as an option.

Although Windows 8.1 made some improvements and I could tolerate it (however awkward it might be), I am staying with Windows 7 because it already includes a friendly desktop with Start Menu and Windows Media Center for recording live tv.  Why should customers lose functionality or incur additional expenses with Windows 8?

The rejection of Windows 8 and 8.1 has gotten so bad that sources say Microsoft is finally talking about bringing back the start menu in Windows 8.2.  See ""Microsoft may finally bring back full Start menu with Windows 8.2""

[...]

Computer manufacturers have become so disgusted with the whole Windows 8 and 8.1 mess that they are now talking about selling computers that run both Windows 8 and Android. (Note: this can't be good news for Microsoft!) See ""PC makers plan rebellion against Windows at 2014 CES, analysts say.""

[...]

My predictions are that we will also see an end to Windows RT.  There will be a desktop Windows 8.(something) and a Windows 8 Phone.  One or the other is going to end up on Microsoft tablets.

I experience zero problems entering and completing my taxes.  You should choose carefully to insure you have the correct software.  Last year, there was a considerable problem for those who discovered that they needed a more expensive tax preparation software..  Regardless, choose carefully.
Pros:
-You can go step by step to make sure you have all of you deductions, credits, or payments covered and correct, or you can select the forms you wish to use.
-One of the best features that information can be pulled from previous year's filing if done on TurboTax.  It is nice to simply check the transferred info this years end make any corrections.  You also don't have to retype the info that you use year after year. It is a good reminder for items that you entered last year and found that you will need documents.
-If you have the info from the previous year's Turbo Tax, you can compare how you did last year with this year.  It gave me a history of how my earnings stacked up with this years earnings among other things.
-If you miss something, there will be indicators to let you know where to go to make corrections or to enter missed info.
-You can stop at anytime and go back to where you were or to go to another place when you reopen.
-Does all the calculations for you and then has a review in which you will have an indication of what you need to check.
-Easy to use and to file taxes.
-There is an indicator to give you an idea if your return could have an audit.  It's not in concrete but does give valuable information.
-I have used this software since it was MacIntax.  I like it and found it to be a very effective tool when going through the tax process.
Cons:
-The ""ItsDeductabel"" doesn't have a lot of items to choose from and I found that a number of the items given to a charity were not listed.  This has been a problem for a long time.  There are not instructions on how to enter the info and continue to use the entry.  Maybe I missed it, but I knew what to do from past software.
-There is no audit help unless you pay an additional $49.99 which is close to what I paid for the software.
-Many times though the filing process there were notifications about the audit program.  It got tedious.
-Safety concerns are addressed but more personal information is required.  Some would consider this problematic.

I considered a different over-all score because some of the concerns I have still linger, like ItsDedutable.  Additionally, it does seem there are more sections are eliminated and a new charge for the item or a different more expensive level of Turbo Tax is required.  .
Considering the pros and cons, I will definitely buy TurboTax again as long as they do not eliminate the forms I need.

The old dates for updates and failed update file were not present in the version I downloaded.

All in all, this package is the gold standard for computer based will creation. It walks you through all the steps required to create a will, as well as document for health care directives, final arrangements and a basic letter to survivors. Of course, the documents are not of much use without getting notarized. Thankfully this is usually pretty simple (and cheap), and only involves going to a notary public with the documents, ID and 2 witnesses. You then all sign in front of the notary, then you can pick where to store it.

Storing the will you created is important - do not store it in a safe deposit box as it may be impossible to access after death. If you have an attorney, some may store it for you for a reasonable fee. There are also online services that do this. This package does come with a one year living trust, but only with one year of access to it. If all else fails, purchase a water and fire proof safe, and store it there. Make sure the important people noted in your will know where to find it in case of your death.

All in all, this package is well worth the money (now it works well) - it includes the online living trust (for 1 year), an online downloadable version of the Nolo basic law guide, the legal answers book for families (in the box, 222 pages) and updates to the software for one year. Like most Quicken products, this product will become obsolete on 12/31, which means you may need to buy a new version next year if you didn't finish this one on time.

Bottom line - if you don't have the money to get an attorney to make your will, and you don't have any overly complex situations (like major investments, multiple properties or complex distributions of your wealth), this package will suit all your needs - as long as you put a bit of effort into it as well.",Now updated to fix bugs - this package will serve all of your living will requirements - as long as you put some effort into it.,1424563200,12.0,

Being a gamer and an artist, I wanted a good performance rig festooned with removable storage ports and cable jacks. So I picked up an HP Media Center and discovered Windows Vista.

Vista Home Premium is to Windows XP as XP was to the Windows 9x series. In other words, I think it's a leap: one of Microsoft's most radical changes in interface, capability, and security that I've experienced. And I've laid my hands on almost every Windows OS since 1992.

Enough so that I find Vista to be superfluous despite its changes. XP users in particular need not apply (an upgrade that is, yuck yuck!).  But for anybody who's looking to finally replace that trusty old copy of 98 Second Edition, or who wants to jump on the multiprocessor, dual video card, high-def graphic experience, then this is the system for you. Just beware--here there be bugs and compatibility issues.

->DOWN TO DETAILS<-

Despite all my talk about big leaps, there is nothing that Vista does that XP users can't do without. Home Premium bundles a number of apps `n' applets that XP must apply separately, but nevertheless is able to apply. Otherwise, the remaining differences are pretty looking, but pretty useless.

>Aeroplane and Horsepower

Such as a new ""glass"" interface called Aero. Everything about it, including the cute sidebar, the marble Start button, and fancy-pants window switching, windows thumbnail, and windows sizing effects--looks better than the ""Fisher Price"" XP. Or any previous version of Windows, for that matter. Vista runs simple effects, such as color-coding file names to indicate a compressed file. And more complex effects: hover the mouse pointer over a program in the taskbar, and a cute little thumbnail screenshot pops up; while hitting the ""switch window"" button in the quick launch box will stack full size pics of your open programs to sort through.

This interface is one of the shallow leaps from XP. It doesn't have much utility but it sure looks like it needs hardware to run. Except Aero ran just fine on my low-range, low powered graphics card installed by the factory: an NVIDIA OEM 7500 LE. And I have confirmed that it will run, if a bit sluggishly, on a single gig of RAM with a modest dual-core processor. Vista also comes preloaded with Direct X 10, which itself is supposed to be a revolution in graphics processing. Since I have no DX10 programs other than Vista, I can't tell you whether this matters or not.

>Stability

What might matter to the performance minded user: stability. I've only used Vista for a couple of months, but I have suffered no OS crashes or freezes. Unlike XP which, while the most stable Windows of its time, still bugged out on me at least once a month. Individual programs still crash or fail to respond--notably AOL and Word 2007. Also, closing a program sometimes triggers a ""Stopped Working"" error message, but I detect no actual harm and I can load such a program right back up. So far Vista has taken every peripheral, drive, and PC card I've thrown at it. On a down note, VHP is so big that a Norton virus scan or disk defrag takes roughly twice as long as it did in XP.

Update 15 AUG 2007: After installing my PSU and graphic card, I noticed system hangs at startup. These seem to be resolved after a recent update. Also, the aforementioned app crashes have been resolved by updates.

Now, in performance, I include the improved power options. Three pre-set states exist: from high-performance/low-savings, to a balanced system, to energy efficiency but low performance. Additionally, the low-power states of previous Windows have been combined in a newish ""Sleep"" mode. According to my documentation, putting the computer into Sleep mode is actually preferable to shutting down the system every night, presumably because Vista runs a number of maintenance programs when I am not looking. These power settings integrate with my monitor's own energy program, incidentally.

>Security

Speaking of management, Vista includes User Account Controls, which basically asks your permission every...single...time...you attempt to install a program, uninstall a program, or run any sort of program which significantly affects the performance of Windows. As an XP veteran myself, I just turn this annoying feature off, since there is currently no scalability to this control (that is, I can't order it what to watch and what to ignore). Vista also has a detailed file sharing security system, to the extent that even an Administrator account can be denied permission to move that Metallica MP3 from your Download folder to your KigAzz Musik folder. No, really, it is that buggy and intrusive.

>Bells n Whistles

Vista also comes preloaded with its own firewall, calendars, news tickers, and system monitors that XP users can separately plug in. Annoyingly, Vista itself has no CPU temperature widget--I have to go into my BIOS for that.

What I think is more useful are all the inherent, if generic, multimedia applications. Vista Home Premium supports HD DVD and HDTV. And users can access their media, including music and video files as well as television, through a Windows Media Center interface. VHP includes generic video capture capability, generic movie editing, generic DVD home movie burning, generic picture gallery, and of course, those old stalwarts, Paint and Sound Recorder (Note that the capabilities of Sound Recorder have been greatly reduced, to the point that in premium it can only record in .wma format and with no onboard editing or sound effect capability). The interface itself is reorganized to include more recognition for gamers. All of your games can be found in a dedicated tab within the Start menu.

Speaking of gamers, Vista is supposed to support games in other ways as well. There's the new Games for Windows protocol, which I really don't know much about, in addition to the graphics support. DX10, incidentally, includes a number of back-compatible Direct3D APIs to support XP-era programs. Games like *Oblivion* run like a dream, while the infamous audio stutter bug of *Half-Life 2* is actually worse than on my XP rig.

Keep in mind also that many new hardware devices still support XP. My new NIVIDA 8600 GTS, for example, includes DX9.0c and supports such systems, even though it is a DX10 card.

->SEND OUT THE BUGS<-

Unfortunately, none of this seems to be enough for *Max Payne* and *Max Payne 2*, which I have been unable to get going on VHP. And that leads me to the compatibility issues. The Windows Upgrade Advisor utility isn't entirely accurate about what software will run well in Vista. I had to replace all of my Norton Software, and I was disgusted to discover that the 2007 edition of SystemWorks still wasn't Vista compatible! And yet, my ancient copy of Adobe Photoshop LE 5.0 functions well enough. My old Canon Zoombrowser has some graphic issues with the buttons, but the pictures themselves appear just fine.

Not so fine are some media limitations. Home Premium includes Windows Media Player 11. This program will write album tags to newly ripped .WAV files. However, old .WAV files cannot be tagged, and will be permanently lumped together under the ""Unknown Album"" section. Because officially, WMP 11 does not support metadata for WAV, just .wma and MP3. Even though it can write in .WAV format. That's just stupid.

Plus, I hate the fact that burning a CD in WMP continues to automatically insert a pause between tracks. Apparently, Bill Gates has never heard a music album that segues, such as almost everything ever published by Frank Zappa and Trent Reznor.

VHP also has some bug issues. As confirmed on the Microsoft support site, wakening the computer from a low-power state causes digital audio drivers to malfunction. In my case, it fills my speakers with static. Three Windows Updates, including the newest one posted on 10 July 2007, have not solved this problem. I found two solutions on my own:

*I can reboot, which is annoying whenever I need to get back on the computer after an absence, such as sleeping, eating, and otherwise living my life.

*Or I can stop using digital audio altogether. Specifically by running analog cables from the speaker outputs of my computer to the multichannel inputs of my receiver, and then telling my computer's sound manager to run speaker audio as the default device. Since *Half-Life 2* only supports analog surround sound anyways, this is no real loss. Except I think it is stupid that a game will happily use stereo cables to support my 5.1 setup, but refuses to use my digital cable for anything except stereo!

->THE BOTTOM LINE<-

Vista is ideal for some and excessive for others.

XP with SP2 is still a current and capable OS, with a third service pack on the way. Microsoft will continue mainstream support until about 2009. So after spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on XP compatible software, you might as well get your money's worth and keep using it. Especially since Vista's successor is already in the works, XP users can safely wait a couple more years.

This is true even for security-minded users. The new account restrictions are appropriate for an actual network that can be accessed by multiple people. You will still need a third party anti-virus and spyware program. For everybody else, XP with Service Pack 2 and regular updates will protect your Jenna Jameson pics and household budgets just fine.

Likewise, those who are serious about media will not need Vista's limited programs. You `ll be looking for more capable products from third party vendors, such as Nero, Paint Shop Pro, or Final Cut. Bleeding-edge gamers and graphic artists will likely appreciate the increased graphics capability, especially since a handful of DX10 games are due this fall, but like physics cards, I wouldn't consider this a must-have tech until 2008.

However, those who are buying their first computer, or who need to replace a much older OS, will benefit from the change in just about every respect: from stability to out-of-the-box capability. You will lose support for some old programs, especially those written before 2002, but those probably need to be replaced anyways. Vista also requires considerably more memory and hard drive space, so those running an older OS are probably in a position to require a hardware upgrade as well.

Finally, Vista Home Premium is ideal for those who want to get their 21st Century Geek on, especially when coupled with a multimedia, high-framerate, high-def death rig. Rrrr! I'm a truck! (Sorry, I just had to throw in a Wildman Fisher reference).

My first exposure to PowerDirector itself was version 10 and I was pleasantly surprised with the program. Version 11 makes some improvements over version 10. My review will focus mainly on version 11 independently.

Video editing and production software from most vendors works the same as music editing and production software packages. A timeline view allows the user to drag and drop content onto it and there is a plethora of special effects and transitions that can be applied to each element to make transitions easier and smoother. Users comfortable with the likes of Sony Acid or Cakewalk will feel right at home with this method of working.

PowerDirector provides a nice media manager that gives an excellent thumbnail view of all of the available content, and what comes with the package is a very good library of different types of content. The Media Room contains the actual media available immediately (though more can be imported without too much effort). The Effects Room contains a number of motion and blur effects that can be easily applied to visual elements on the timeline. The PiP (Picture in Picture) Room contains several animation elements, mostly drawing effects. The Particle Room contains a couple of motion-type effects that involve multiple embedded objects. The Title Room is for all things text and text effects. The Transition Room contains transition effects that apply to visual elements and made the change between two elements a lot smoother and/or more interesting. The Audio Mixing Room is a simple equalizer and sound balancer for audio elements. The Voice-Over Recording Room allows for direct recording into the production either through a microphone or from the sound card.

PowerDirector provides the ability to capture input from connected devices such as a webcam or a video recorder. The interface to these devices is very straightforward and simple - there's a record button that turns recording on and off, and there is the ability to change the location of captured content and resolution/bitrate settings.

PowerDirector is able to create media in a number of formats, both audio and video. Supported formats include AVI, MPEG-2, AVC, WMV, MPEG-4, MOV, and MKV files. I was unable to find MP3 file output which is a mild disappointment.

My son likes to make stop-motion videos with Legos, and for this task PowerDirector is well-suited. We have been able to import all of his photos at once (usually over 500 individual pictures) put them all on the timeline, change the display duration and create an initial cut at a video in less than 10 minutes. Cyberlink claims to have fast rendering speeds, and PowerDirector 11 seems to live up to those claims in our workings.

The Ultimate version differs from the Ultra (base) version in that it includes additional content packs and filters. These are nice-to-have additions but are certainly not required to be productive.

Comparing versions 10 and 11, while there is a speed difference and there is some minor tweaks in the interface to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing, I am not sure that there's a compelling reason to upgrade to version 11 if you already have version 10. The main considerations are the speed improvements and the content, and the content does not seem to have changed too much so it comes down to speed. If the optimizations that make version 11 faster than version 10 are crucial, then it's worth pondering the upgrade. Try the trial version first before committing to see if this is worthwhile.

I like PowerDirector. It's a powerful and easy-to-use video production application that does a nice job of allowing a user to assemble a video quickly. The interface is mostly intuitive and the inner workings are efficient. This is a good package at a very reasonable asking price.","Solid, Intuitive Video Production Software",1357603200,,

** CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE 10/29/09 **
It seems that a lot of upgraders have been complaining about the upgrade process, especially from XP. Most of us expected to be able to format our hard disks and be prompted for either the XP disc or product key. Alas, this is not the case. The upgrade is much more complicated than it should be and some workarounds have been discovered

Method A (simplest)
If you already have an older version of Windows on the hard drive, finish the Custom Install,  without entering the product key.  After installation, go to your System Properties and click the link to activate Windows.  Enter your product key and it should activate.  This has worked for me twice.

Method B (hardest)
If Method A doesn't work, try the registry hack.
1. Finish the custom install without entering the product key then click Start and type regedit.exe into the ""Search programs and files"" box.
2. In the registry, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/.  In the pane on the right, you'll see an entry for MediaBootInstall.  Double-click on it and change the value from ""1"" to ""0"" and click OK.
3. Close regedit and go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories then right-click on Command Prompt and select ""Run as administrator.""  You'll get a UAC alert, click Yes.
4. At the command prompt, type: slmgr /rearm and hit Enter.  Reboot.
5. Now try to activate.  If it fails, make sure there are no pending Windows Updates to install.  If there is, install them, reboot and start over from Step 4.

Method C (most time consuming)
Perform the Custom Install and skip the product key. Once completed, run the upgrade again from within Windows 7 but this time, enter the Windows 7 upgrade key and then activate Windows.
** END UPDATE **

I had been running the Windows 7 release candidate for 3 months and the full version 2 weeks before official release date.  The experience convinced me to finally upgrade my Windows XP systems to 7.  This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.

PERFORMANCE & STABILITY
One of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.

64-BIT
I am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.

DESKTOP
At first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have ""pinned"" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.

LIBRARIES
Windows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.

NETWORKING
Even as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.

SECURITY
Security in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender.  Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton/dp/B002L7BR20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton</a>.  User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions.  Coming from XP however, it is still annoying.  Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives.  Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt.

POWER MANAGEMENT
Power management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.

WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER
I've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.

WINDOWS XP MODE
For applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode. Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.  XP Mode is available in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Professional/dp/B002DHGM50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Professional</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Ultimate/dp/B002DHLV8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;editions.

RECOMMENDATION
If you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading.  Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements.  For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice.  If you decide on Windows 7 Home Premium and need to upgrade more than one PC, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Upgrade-Family-Pack/dp/B002MV2MG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack</a>, which is an excellent deal.  I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional.  I suggest a clean install for best results.  If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.

- Stability is poor.  The system frequently blue screens (crashes) or, more commonly, hangs.  It's not a hardware problem, because both systems experienced these issues, and neither system has any issues running XP.  Vista Media Center slowly degrades over time (one of the computers is my living room DVR) until it is unusable without a hourly reboot (seriously!)
- Speed - I play a lot of games, and Vista is consistently and significantly slower on every single game I've tried.  The difference is significant, even WITH the very latest ""Vista Certified"" video and sound drivers.  Then, there are games that crash on Vista, but have no issues on XP.  You can say ""Well, they were tested to work with XP"", and you'd be right, but I'd rather be running an OS that games were tested with.  And the DirectX 10 effects, which only Vista supports, are very ho-hum - they're not worth the performance hit, in my opinion.  For an example, check out the Crysis DirectX 9 vs. DirectX 10 comparisons on the net.
- Hardware support - this really is not Microsoft's fault, but it is still an issue.  Many hardware manufacturers quietly refusing to release drivers for their existing hardware, in an effort to force people to buy new hardware for Vista support.  That's totally not Microsoft's fault - but make sure your devices are Vista compatible, BEFORE you buy Vista.  Microsoft has a  good compatibility guide on their website for this.  Scanners, printers, music players, phones, and wireless network gear are the gadgets with the worst Vista driver support, as are notebooks not specifically ""designed for Vista"".

I'm not saying you should NOT buy Vista, but if you do, be prepared for the problems you will encounter.  It might be better for a business user who is buying all new Vista compatible hardware.","Stability, speed, hardware support are poor",1218240000,3.0,

SketchBook Pro successfully combines power and simplicity into one package, such that even a weak artist can be productive and successful.

I ran into a problem when installing the application - the installer crashed, giving some odd internal error and number. I tried again immediately and the second try went without a hitch. I assume it is a configuration issue with my system as I have occasional strange issues when installing software.

When first launched, the application asks if you have your serial number and key handy. If you are new to SketchBook Pro, I encourage you NOT to enter them just yet but instead specify that you want a 15-day trial. The reason is that you get presented a quick pictoral tour of the feature set when you run in trial mode (which is really just a time-limited demo mode with everything enabled), which is a nice introduction. Afterward, registration information can be entered through the help menu.

Being new to SketchBook Pro myself, I was startled by the sparse interface when opening a new canvas. There was little on the screen other than the main menu up top and the lagoon in the lower left. Most drawing applications clutter the screen with an assortment of toolbars, palettes, wizards and other things that just get in the way. Autodesk keep their application simple instead, putting the essentials out there and leaving everything else off the screen until it's really needed.

Most elements of the application are available in radial menus, accessible either through clicking on icons on the lagoon or right-clicking on the canvas. All menu items have help tips to guide along the way so you know what option you're choosing. Radial menus can be a surprise to those who have never been exposed to them, but once used to them they are very powerful and easy to use.

Plunging into the various options available, I immediately discovered a couple of things I have never before used in drawing applications. First, I discovered the symmetry options, which makes creating mirror images easy. Using the axis, I was able to draw a crude figure of a person in about 10 seconds without even expending any real thought. Even more productive for me, though, was the ruler, especially in combination with the layering tool. The ruler is a slight misnomer, as it is actually more of a straight-edge against which to draw straight lines.

Another interesting surprise was the help system. When I launched the help system, rather than bring up a compiled help file, my default web browser launched and I was presented with one of the best help systems I have seen. The help is easy on the eyes and very straightforward to use. There is sufficient detail with pictures to address almost any conceivable question that might arise.

SketchBook Pro is very fast and very responsive on my system. I am running Vista with 3GB of ram and a dual-core 2.1G Intel processor, and there is only the slightest hint of hesitation on rare occasion.

Having never played with SketchBook Pro before and being a poor artist, I was shocked that I could create viable results in minutes.

Most retail offerings are overpriced, difficult to install, and confusing to maintain.  And then the cherry on top is that they typically bog down your computer's performance while letting the bad stuff through anyway.

But PC Tools Internet Security 2009 has turned me around on this topic.  It installed easily on my Windows XP (sp3) workstation after I had removed my prior security suite (begone forever, Norton 360!), including automatically retrieving all of the latest updates.  Registration was as simple as providing the product key and my email address - immensely less obtrusive than the Norton runaround.

The dashboard is easy to read, visually separating its protection against spyware, viruses, spam and intrusion (i.e. firewall) into different portions of the screen.  Globally useful information such as the most recent scan date and how many days are left on your subscription are placed in immediate view - no digging required.  Click any of the protection panes and you get detailed information including helpful links for setting runtime options and viewing historical results.  It's all very user-friendly and intuitive.

PC Tools really shines during routine use.  Aside from the times when it was running an update, the software's footprint was very manageable, both in terms of CPU and memory usage.  So no more slowdowns during browsing.  And it manages to provide this protection without cluttering up your browser with any branded toolbar nonsense - imagine that, Norton!

Its schedule, thresholds and notifications are all simple to customize so that you get the level of protection that you want without going overboard with non-stop messages and warnings.  Their IntelliGuard feature is aimed at ensuring ongoing protection while not overloading the average user with technical minutiae.  Let's face it - the average Internet user doesn't know (or even want to know) hot to properly configure his or her firewall.  IntelliGuard does a good job of doing it for the user, sparing a lot of the confusion which can actually lead to loopholes in security.

Its scans seem to be very thorough - it immediately picked up lots of resident malware and other nonsense that Norton had quietly let live on my PC for who knows how long.  This version also touts a new ""Behavior Guard"" feature that supposedly catches potential threats based on monitoring suspect activity in the OS of your computer.  Put another way, a virus doesn't have to become ""known"" and added to everyone's update list for you to be protected from it.  How well does it work?  Well, that's difficult for the layperson to assess, but I can tell you that a month in, I'm yet to have any virus or malware-related problems and I feel much more confident than I ever did with any other retail suite.  I'll certainly update this review if anything bad happens under PC Tools' watch, however.

The PC Tools Internet Security suite comes bundled with licenses for one year of protection for three computers, so it's also a good value compared to the retail competition.

In fact, I cannot tell that there is a single improvement over prior editions.  I think Intuit is milking this product for profit rather than investing in it.

For example, for corporations, the Form 1120 defaults to assuming that someone owns 20% or more of the firm, forcing the listing of such people on a form G.  As in years past, you must switch to forms mode, uncheck the box (never offered in the interview) that says someone owns more than 20% of the firm, and then manually delete the G.

The most infuriating thing about the 1120 is that as of yesterday, March 13, you could neither print nor e-file the return - which is due on March 15 (!) - because the TurboTax forms were out of date.  Yet, the iRS released the final 1120 forms on March 1.  How could it possibly take a vastly capitalized corporation like Intuit more than a day to make whatever minor adjustments were in the final forms?  TurboTax did update itself today, March 14, to allow for filing.  Infuriatingly last-minute nonsense.

When e-filing the 1120 today, now that the forms are available, I chose ACH debit (as opposed to EFTPS) to pay the tax due.  On the confirmation screen, TurboTax confirmed that I selected EFTPS (not) with an edit button to change it - clicking the Edit button took me back to the screen showing ACH and the bank routing/account numbers/etc.  Just one of a dozen or more glitchy buggy things.

A cosmetic bug, but one that is disconcerting, is a screen under Federal Review that just says ""This is Heading Text / This is a Subheading""  (screenshot posted with product images above).  Clicking the Federal Review tab again gets the correct page, but, really.

For trusts filing 1041, expenses allocated to income are still not allocated, by default, to interest and dividends (etc) by pro-ration, as is done by most tax preparers, not is there a question or checkbox in the interview to allow for that.  As in years past, all expenses are subtracted against interest, fully, first, then dividends/other income.  You have to switch to forms mode and find the checkbox to manually check to do the allocation as desired.  K-1 allocations are also not complete, with Foreign Tax credit not properly allocated to the beneficiary.

These are just a few of the issues in this clunky, never-improved, Intuit cash-cow.

Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill was the first game ever created in the series-and it shows. It is definitely the worst in the series, but it still is able to give quite a fun gaming experience.

Story-The story is that your Aunt Eloise (who is the librarian at a high school) has asked you to come help solve a murder. A boy was pushed down a flight of stairs, and it's your job to find out who did it. It's a very generic story, and it really isn't developed as much as it could have been.

Graphics-They aren't good at all compared to today's graphics, but in the '90s, they were awesome. The backgrounds are 3D, somewhat, but they are VERY grainy. Still, they are done quite well. The characters in this game are cartoon characters and are slightly disappointing visually.

Sound-The music is nice in the game and sets a mysterious mood over the game. The voice acting isn't really good at all, but the background sounds are very nicely done.

Gameplay-This is a first-person point-and-click game. You simply click arrows to determine your direction. This game is a little strange in the fact that at some locations you can look up or down slightly for no apparent reason, but otherwise, it's not too hard to figure out. The puzzles in the game are fairly easy and don't require too much thought. They are mostly just finding objects to interact with other objects later in the game. You can call your friends in order to get hints, but all they do is give you a hint before hanging up; in other words, unlike other games, you cannot have conversations with your friends on the phone. Probably the most annoying aspect of the game is that you have to continuously switch discs as you switch locations in the game, which can be quite annoying.

Fun-It was fun, but it really doesn't have replay value as the others in the series do. It's too boring. It wasn't scary at all, but you can die in the game. If you do, you press second chance and you go back to the scene right before you died.

Length-It seriously took me 3 hours to play and finish. And the constant disc changing factor probably took 20 minutes of that time. It's not long at all.

I recommend this game to fans who are waiting for the next game to come out, but only if you can get it cheap. It's fun, but it is short, and it is a one time thing.

The device instantly sends info to your smart phone concerning where the car has driven and at what time, whether or not the driver was speeding and by how many miles over the limit, how much gas is in the tank, whether the battery is functioning properly, if the device has been removed, etc. You can also follow your car's movements real time.

This is brilliant! Not only does it let you, the parent and car owner, keep tabs on your car, it lets the driver see his/her ""report card"" and helps them become better drivers (hopefully.) It would also be excellent for when deadbeat relatives want to borrow your car ""to run to the convenience store""...

It would make it very simple to track a car that has been stolen, too. This is something I really like since I live in a large city and actually had my car stolen some years ago. I hope I never need it for this purpose but I'm glad it's there.

The service costs $19.99/mo and you can start and stop service as needed with no penalties because there is no contract.

In the past, I've used Adobe Flash and Windows Movie Maker to make my trailers. Both have their pluses and minuses. Flash, for example, is expensive and comes with a high learning curve, whereas Windows Movie Maker is free (on the Windows OS), but extremely limiting.

Some authors (and publishers) create simple slide transitions with static imagery accompanied by background music. I, personally, find these types of trailers a bit dull, and not all that professional. The more ""movie-like"" a book trailer can be the better chance it has of gaining interest.

Like Flash, Anime Studio uses both a timeline and layers, which gives you the ability to create detailed motions: such as a character walking with clouds floating in the background. The bone structure in AS (Anime Studio) allows for easy character movements, such as lifting an arm and bending an elbow at the same time. This actually works easier than it does in Flash. I also like how there is a library of pre-made body parts, such as eyes (with different expressions) and mouths that animate automatically based on the words spoken in your audio (you can also change the pitch of your voice to sound more cartoon'ish-which you can record directly in the program). This is a major time saver. There are also wizards that help you to create your own custom characters without much effort (though I wish there was an easy way to create backgrounds too). Another great feature is that you can directly (from AS) upload your animations to Facebook and YouTube.

That said, as an Adobe designer (for over ten years), I found the tools and shortcuts in Anime Studio different enough to make simple tasks somewhat difficult. My thought was to design my vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator, and then import them into AS. This isn't possible in Anime Studio Debut, but it is in the Pro version, which provides the ability to use Adobe for some things and AS for others.

If you are considering the Debut version instead of Pro, consider these limitations: a 2 minute animation maximum, limit of 3000 frames, no more than 2 audio tracks, only 1 video track, no 3D support, a 788 x 768 maximum export size, among a plethora of other limitations and missing features. I strongly suggest visiting the SmithMicro website and viewing their comparison chart if you are considering the Debut version over the Pro.

I'd rather see QBs volunteer the name of the account and the new, added name so I could just get on with it.

I keep my account names last name comma first name style. I would imagine that everyone would if you have a lot of account names.

It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.  I highly recommend the product.

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version.  It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document.  Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!
One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.
As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

An interface that sucks being your only option across desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, and gaming console. The key words aren't, in deference to the Windows 8 fanboys, ""only option"". The real fighting words are ""that sucks.""
Some people do not feel that way, but then again they think every trend is a good one-and I saw some trends during my time in school that have me ready to deliver TKOs to innocent objects when I think back on them, and the same is true with Windows 8.
As it was with Vista, and they share important qualities. They were ever more refined implementations of a certain highly distasteful vision of computing. One that Steve Jobs did both infinitely better and equally horrid at doing simultaneously given the appropriate tools.
For this to work, it has to work better than s***. Which, despite a Start butt on, as opposed to what you get with Windows 7, is NOT the case. It's flat, colorless, atrocious, and despite all that I would be willing to put up with it if I could get the right PC to run it on.
The key is on it you spend all your time in the Metro UI and don't play music since the default Windows Metro music playing application is more limited in function than a hood ornament on a fancy vintage car-and also only venturing to the desktop when you need to change a desktop only located setting, and using free apps as much as you can.
(If I am going to pay money for apps, Apple will get my money because they're full-featured desktop applications with their only disadvantage being they're distributed like apps.)
I don't want 16-color display on a monitor supporting millions of colors, and that's why I compromised and went for 7. I gave up on the third-generation Core i3, gave up on integrated Bluetooth, but don't have Vista 2.0 or 2.1 related headaches either in the user interface or in the background processes carrying out intense extracurricular activities.
Instead I have Vista 1.1, which has a halfway tolerable amount of extracurricular activities and a UI that makes Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows 8 Pro or even Enterprise look like bloated unruly pigs.
It's not that Windows 8 sucks, it's that the vision that caused it to come to pass sucks, and not even in theory but merely in practice.
Oddly enough, I do like Metro on an Xbox-and don't give me the crap about how Windows 8 turns your computer into an Xbox. Because you have top-flight for the era graphics hardware in a gaming console and you often have graphics that are crap when it comes to games in a PC because they're different devices. With different target markets when comparing low-end PCs to gaming consoles.
And it also works well on the Windows RT Microsoft Surface (the Surface Pro has full PC power, and so that comparison falls flat, as it does with all the other permutations of laptops and desktops), but on phones, laptops, desktops, and full PC or even Atom ULCPC tablet systems Metro does not work-you want Windows 7 and Microsoft won't allow it because they want to increase the level of Vistafication and force you to accept it or push you off the Internet.
I'm about to go off the Internet before I'll adopt Vista 2.0 in the guise of the Windows 8 family, but then again I want to confirm what I have been reading. (But budget restrictions will likely nix it.)",The fanboys and haters are both right! Just not completely.,1384992000,3.0,

Also, file compression decreases the time required to transfer the data and allows you to email more data if your email service limits the size of attachments.

WinZip has been around since 1991, but it is not the only compression utility available.  Other popular compression utilities include 7-Zip, WinRAR and MagicRAR.  All of the  compression utilities can handle ZIP, the most commonly-used compression format, along with a number of other popular formats such as 7z, RAR, TAR, and GZIP.  WinZip does not compress into CAB, RAR, TAR, 7Z, or LHA/LZH.

Performance
The speed with which WinZip 18 compresses files depends on your processor.  Toms Hardware benchmarked several different compression programs using different processors and found that the choice of processor could half the time required for compression.  You can speed up the compression even further by choosing the OpenCL under preferences.  WinZip 18 claims to be the fastest version yet, but I haven't noticed great increases in speed as compared to WinZip 17 on my Core i7 machine.

File Formats
WinZip 18 can compress into six file formats including: Zip, BZ2, ZipX, PPMD, LZMA and WavPack. WinZip can not compress into CAB, RAR, TAR, 7Z, or LHA/LZH.  However, it can extract files from 13 formats including ZIP, CAB, RAR, GZ, ISO, TAR, TGZ, IMG, ZipX, BZ2, PPMD, 7Z and LZMA. This is very useful if you share compressed data with people who use other compression formats.

Zip to the Cloud
WinZip works not just with local files but also with data stored o the most popular cloud sites.  WinZip 18 supports Box, CloudMe, Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive and the newly added SugarSync as well as ZipSend, WinZips sharing service.  WinZip 18 can retrieve files from the cloud or send data to the cloud in compressed form saving space and the time to log into your account.

Installation
I downloaded the latest version from the internet with the intention of then entering my license code from the product box I received.  During installation, I was asked if I wanted to add a toolbar to my browser and to improve WinZip by sending WinZip your usage data and the default option is to send the data.  I didn't want to do either and WinZip never bothered me about these things again.  So be careful when you install the product that you don't get third-party tools that you don't want or need.  Especially since I have gone back to find out more about the program to make WinZip better and I can find the settings turn this on or off.

Once WinZip was installed, I needed to enter my license code and then validate it online.  Here is where I had trouble because I kept getting errors.  I Googled the error and it turns out this is a common installation problem in Windows 7 64 bit.  It turns out that The Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista operating systems have security rules and User Account Control settings that restrict writing data to certain protected files and folders.  So, Windows was preventing the validation.  I tried following the workaround offered on the WinZip website which required me to delete a folder from my computer, but this turned out to be useless.  However, I could complete the installation by simply right clicking on the icon WinZip put on my desktop and running the program as an administrator.  Note that this method will not work if you don't have administrative rights on your computer.

Express Add Ons
One of the new features of WinZip 18 is the ability to add Express Add Ons.  These are programs for Windows Explorer, for Photos, for Outlook and for Sharepoint.  However, be aware that with the exception of the Add On for Windows Explorer, you have to pay an additional fee for the Add Ons.

The Add ON for Windows Explorer is free with the WinZip 18 license.  The Add On provides fast access to the key features in WinZip: compression, encryption, file conversion and watermarking, sharing via social media or email and uploading to a cloud service. All these options are present in a single window and achieving the task involves just a few clicks.  The benefit is that you don't have to launch the main WinZip program when using the Add On.

Summary
Overall, WinZip is a very good file compression utility with a lot of features that allow you to do more with the files you compress.  The ability to upload and to view files on the Cloud through the program are nice features.  I found the default options for adding AVG and performance enhancers to be annoying during installation, but since then there have been no other annoyances.",Very good compression software.

I would not consider this to be a product on the level of Adobe Premiere. Granted, that should be something of a no-brainer, but it helps to have proper expectations. As reasonably-robust video-editing software at a fair price, Nero 2014 works well. The Blu-Ray viewer works wonderfully, saving the need to purchase other stand-alone software. The burning process has, in my experience, worked flawlessly. I don't have any coasters, but I can't say I've burned more than a handful. The video-editing software is lacking, but when I compare it to Apple offerings such as iMovie, I find it's up to the task of creating basic home movies.

The Suite is fairly robust, covering all the basic needs of this decidedly amateur video-editor. I have no doubt someone with most extensive experience in this field would find Nero 2104 to be a limitation, but for the ""average Joe"" looking to spend something less than a fortune, Nero continues to deliver.

nb I would not purchase this software at full retail, but the current price of 50 seems to be exactly right.

EDIT: I recently had to reinstall Windows, so I had to go through the Nero install process a second time. This time I was reminded that Nero attempts to install adware twice on your computer. While some might consider this beneficial, I am entirely opposed to such efforts when the software was paid-for rather than free. An unobservant user would be stuck with both the AVG toolbar and Nero's own ad software.

While there are many free and shareware options available, they aren't always compatible with many systems. 7-Zip, a popular option was used by my company. I had to stop using it because everyone I sent zip files to could not open or read anything compressed with 7-Zip even though many had the program installed on their computers. We never had this problem using WinZip. It is a standard that does work well with virtually any program. I didn't see a large amount of difference between version 17 as opposed to version 18. It is still fast and efficient. I do love the integration with the cloud services. WinZip will zip to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive (formerly Skydrive from Microsoft), Box, SugarSync and CloudMe. It will also zip to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. It also will encrypt your files for protection. The Cloud navigation has been improved, though it was always easy for me to access my Cloud zips before. You can also send links to you zip files in the Cloud if you need to share them. I also love the fact that you can create PDF files from WinZip and add watermarks. That is a great option if you don't have a PDF creator available. You can also create self-extracting zip files for those who don't have a zip program. It handles the usual RAR, 7-Zip, BZ2 and many others. When extracting encrypted files WinZip does auto wipe the temporary files for protection One new feature are the WinZip Express Add-Ons. The new Add-Ons are available for Windows Explorer (in Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows 8 has replaced Explorer with OneDrive), photos, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft SharePoint (Enterprise option for work) and photos. As is normal for Corel, only the Add-On for Explorer is free to registered users of WinZip 18. The other options are $12.95 with a discount for registered users of $9.95 at the time of this writing. Although I find WinZip to be the best service for zipping, compressing and encrypting files that I have used, Corel charges for everything now, upgrades to Pro, extra charges for the Add-Ons. I am certain these were separated because inclusion would have made the program more costly and everyone does not need as many features. WinZip has also ballooned to include a wide variety of services besides the base product and you will hear about those after you register your email address (required). It is still the best overall for regular consumers and the easiest to use that works with nearly everything.

It seems every time that I sit down to use my Mac, which never causes me problems, I get the call from her to come over and try to repair an issue with her PC. The basic problem has been that it constantly freezes up, it's always running slowly and about 50% of the time when she tries to open a window, all she sees is the spinning wheel.

I have been looking for a NON-Adobe product that does more to enhance my photographs than the free program I currently have. This promised great potential, since it is supposed to allow you to layer images, substitute faces, etc.; however, I did not find it lived up to my expectations.

My first clue that this was not the product for me came with its installation. One the one hand, I was impressed that this program came with a CD which I can keep as a back-up, or provided a link to allow me to download a digital version. It also has QR code for users to scan to link them to aps for their Android, iOS and Windows versions for other devices. But then I found out this is an ""all or nothing"" software. I like programs that let me determine what features I want installed on my computer. CyberLink doesn't let you do this. You get everything written onto your hard drive, and you can't disable anything. Not only that, but you get periodical pop-ups that nag you to add this or that for a price.

Like everything else these days, this program wants you to put everything in the Cloud. Not happening! That's a security risk I don't want. My stuff is mine, and I want it to stay that way--particularly creative work. Thankfully, this program gives you the option, but doesn't mandate saving images in the Cloud.

My biggest problem was importing pictures to be able to edit them. In the free version of Picassa (my current photo-editing program), all you do is double-click on a PDF or other image file, and it opens it for viewing (I set it as my default viewer, so it would do this). Then I click a button in the viewing pane that says, ""Edit in Picassa."" Bam! It's there, and I can start playing with it immediately. With PhotoDirector, you have to click File, then Import, and then go through this long rig-a-marrow to bring a photo into the program to edit. With Picassa, once you open a folder and start working on one picture, you can systematically scroll through all the files in that folder and modify them one-by-one. I tried this in PhotoDirector, but never figured out how to make it work.

Making the changes is not as easy or ""intuitive"" as some users made it sound. In most cases, you have to do a lot of clicking, tweaking, checking, etc., to get the enhancement you want. I really hate the crop part, in particular, because it consistently wants to retain the original aspect of the photo, even when you click that you want something else. You can do some fun stuff with people's bodies and faces, but I am not into caricatures as much as correctly representing people. The layering and background modification would be super useful for a graphic artist, but that's not my thing either. If I want to build a great-looking graphic, I find it's a whole lot easier to do it in Publisher.

My biggest beef with this program is how it saves stuff. With Picassa, you get your picture, change it, and then save it directly to the original location. You can either do a simple Control-S or click Save; or to rename and create a new file, do a Save As and put it wherever you please. To delete a file, you just right click and tell the computer to delete it, or drag it to your trash can. With PhotoDirector, it doesn't automatically save a single file to your original folder; you have to tell the program you want it there, and it saves multiple files at once--kind of like when you build an html file. If you want to delete something that has been through PhotoDirect, you have to close the program, or it won't let it go. If you are doing a whole folder of images at once, this gets to be a super time-consuming pain! It also changes the dates on your modified photos, so you don't have a record of when you originally took the picture and then modified it; you just have a set of dates logging the photo as having been created and modified on the day that PhotoDirect had it in its clutches. When you go back some other time to put photos in chronological order to create album pages, as I like to do, this makes your task really hard.

While this program has some cool features for the person with a lot of time on their hands and a truckload of creative energy, it is not for me. I like something quick, simple and direct, that doesn't make me jump through a lot of hoops to get what I want done. I want to control what goes onto my computer, and I don't want a constant barrage of ads to entice me to upgrade to a more expensive package or add features.

Occasionally they have made disastrous mistakes, and although the underlying program still does its job, the additions or subtractions sometimes get to be appalling. Some update changes were made about 4 to 5 months back (at the very least) which has resulted in an update capability that works something like iTunes. Norton Internet security has basically operated at its optimum with Internet Explorer; this is rather  unfortunate since there are several browsers which are perfectly good, but I'm not NIS compatible.
  The majority of exploits, malware, and virii that afflict Internet Explorer, usually turn out to be self-imposed problems (someone clicked on yes to load an add-in or a toolbar, when they should've clicked no), or the most common source of those selfsame problems come from advertising servers that go to safe pages, and you have no control over the exploit that is going
to be loaded, but Norton catches the issue. A new browser, currently titled AVIATOR, is now out, and once it has a Windows version, it will obviate at least some of the tasks that Norton Internet security has been doing. I  will not comment on AVIATOR, except to say that I would suggest you check it out. Since the constant updating of the core of NIS has been instituted so that it has ""always up-to-date"" engines/programs (not just the standard signature and heuristic updates) I have had way too many technical issues on multiple Windows platforms. It's annoying, and potentially of big problem, but since I need to use Internet Explorer, I need to use NIS.
  The one part that had worked very well up until NIS 2012, was the page login for individual websites: the big change in NIS 2013 was to make the so-called ""vault"" database located in the cloud. Personally, I preferred the local PC to have my database for individual websites, but now I am forced to use the cloud. This issue for me is basically the dealbreaker, since they offer no alternative to a cloud location of the vault , and so once I can satisfactorily find and implement a local webpage login (it looks like KEEPASS will be the choice) I will go for the most immediate Internet security suite that is on a par with Norton Internet security, and in many respects (as far as I have tested) much better. The other two things that you need to have running to either compensate for the new and definitely not improved Norton Internet security, is switch on shadow copy if you have a Windows system, and run Norton Utilities regularly. I definitely regret giving Norton/Symantec a bad review, but the product at this point is not something I can safely recommend if you want to have good security.

UPDATE 3_30_14: I have to give some credit where credit is due. One of my laptops yesterday was affected by an unusual download, or an access through a web page. It was basically close to inoperable. I tried to run the utilities I could run and nothing worked except for  Norton Power Eraser. I was not in the habit of using this for a while and it ran a Rootkit scan and a registry scan, and it fixed ALL of the basic problems that had the Laptop crippled. I have Norton still running with all the heuristics and checked it afterwards. This was an amazing fix and it was quick.

This makes it very flexible in that you can capture footage from just about any device that might be used in your home:  phones, camcorders, GoPros, etc.  Then you can watch your results on an equally impressive array of devices aimed at fitting everyone's needs - if the kids want to watch on their Xbox, no problem; if you want to share with Grandma via Facebook, fine; if your team posts their highlight clips to YouTube or Vimeo, you can do that.  This flexibility is a threshold requirement these days and Pinnacle Studio is definitely up to speed.

The editing process is simple but powerful.  I've used several different home editing suites and always come back to Pinnacle due to the simplicity of the on-screen interface and controls.  I'm able to make great-looking videos that get lots of ""wow - how did you do that?"" comments without having to fumble around indefinitely figuring out how to do this transition or drop in that graphic.  That, coupled with its affordability make it a great choice for anyone looking to quickly make family movies, team highlight reels, etc.

What's the difference and why is it important? Allow me to explain:

A subscription is like a lease. You pay a set amount of money either monthly or for one year and gain access to something (an apartment, a piece of software) and may use it for the agreed upon amount of time. Once the lease (or the subscription) is terminated, you LOSE your right to use said item. That might be fine for apartments, but much less so for software. You are beholden to the company that created the software forever. If they decide to STOP making the software, you lose your data, and even more importantly, your ability to access and use your previously collected data. Or at least you might, and that's a huge risk for something like accounting data. You might be stuck manually entering years worth of data by hand from printed reports (assuming you have them all).

When you purchase something, you have several protected rights. One is the right to use what you purchased however you like and for as long as you like (fair use). You also have the right to sell that thing to someone else (First Sale doctrine). With a subscription you have neither of those things, and the lease or subscription holder can take your ability to use the software away from you any time they like. Perhaps they won't, but its an undeniable factor that must be taken into account.

All that said, SAGE and QUICKBOOKS use the same model, so you're not really going to have much choice but to have a subscription if you want a professional accounting software. That's sad, but true.

Then came along McAfee and we had some competition.  Now there are a multitude of options out there and I have had some experience with just about all of themand to be honest I still think Norton is the best.

Reasons for that: I feel Norton still spends the most resources on updating and fighting new threats compared to others.  I have interacted with them before on a particular virus problem and they were very good and very professional.  And I believe they take very seriously all the threats that are out in the world.

360 is Nortons kind of all in one product, meaning it focuses on everything from viruses in downloads, scams in email, outside intrusions into your personal network.  The software really does try to offer a 360 degree protection for your machine.

This is a one user, three license product, meaning it is intended for one person to use on perhaps three different machines.  You basically sign up for your Norton account and you can now download the software on to three separate machines.  One desktop, two laptops; or two desktops and one laptop, you get the picture.  You can move the licenses if you need to but it is a bit of a hassle.  As uninstalling Norton is never easy.

The two biggest negative things I have to say about Norton is that, one, it is a resource hog.  You really need a somewhat up to date computer.  Anything too old or two slow and this software can cause things to come to a crawl on your computer.  You won't have any viruses, but your computer will run pretty darn slow.

The other thing I don't like is the control scheme, Norton can be really easy to use, if you let Norton do what it wants, but if you are a power user, and you like to change a lot of settings and really control what Norton does and when it does it, it is harder rather than easy.  I wish Norton would have two different interfaces.  One for regular users, and perhaps one for power users that allows easy changing or settings.

It has that very helpful module for figuring out your charitable deductions. It has that same interview format you may know and, er, love. It makes doing your own taxes less frightening, what with their calculation guarantee and their now included access to tax experts by phone. You can also now import your investments, mortgage info and W-2s from  over one million companies, including the federal government, which is also a time saver.

So, all the hullabaloo about their greedy grab aside, I have to admit it's still a pretty helpful piece of software, when it works.

However, there are still areas where it could improve. Some of the questions are not clear, and some of the consequences of your answers are not clear. One thing they really, really need to add is the ability to drill down and show you how this or that number was derived. Trying to figure out how they came up with some mysterious number can be maddening, especially TurboTax keeps changing it like it did when we tried to do amended returns.

Another improvement would be a clearer explanation of what you're entering, such as the confusion that results if you try to adjust estimated taxes (the number you enter is an adjustment, plus or minus).

Another hiccup we had was in trying out scenarios. What would happen if we added a contribution of X dollars to an IRA? We entered the W2 and other income information, then went to deductions to try this out. We answered some questions. Was this repaying a withdrawal? Were there nondeductible contributions? etc. At the end, TurboTax just said we were not eligible for this deduction, with no explanation, and also that this might change once the return was completed. What??? What else needed to be done for it to be ""completed""? Why might it change? No further information was given. We went back and tried different answers to the questions (as far as they made sense) but got the same result. So here is another scenario where TurboTax mysteriously decides something with no explanation. There was no on-screen info about how to call an expert.

I'd give them 3 stars for adding the phone support (which I have not yet tried, since I will have to find out how to contact them) and general usefulness of the software. I may revise this as I enter more of the tax information that is still trickling in this year.","Greedy grab aside, it's still useful and adds value with phone support ... but still maddening at times",1422835200,,

I found 2012 a complete rethinking of the much older version that I had been using for a number of years. Now the 2014 is an update rather than an upgrade. If you have another version of Family Tree Maker on your computer installing this one means you have two versions on your computer.

I uninstalled 2014 from the netbook and installed it on a new laptop with Windows 8.1.  It went on easily with the program immediately updating itself and also downloading and installing at least twice in the last month.  You do need to install the program entirely to your computer. You cannot run it by putting the disc in the CD/DVD drive. Do make sure you have a substantial amount of memory available on your hard drive.

I can't tell a great deal of difference between the 2012 version and this version. However, there was a paper manual included, which is a miracle.  It's a handy size and easy to read and follow if you have some basic knowledge of the program.

I own a small graphics company, small publishing company and I write for a living. I upgraded recently to a 64-bit 8-core unit that I built with the help of a software tech engineer. I've never purchased a ""brand name"" computer except years ago when CPM was the hot language of desktops. When DOS came along I started building my own. Each new upgrade is always a challenge since software makers are using more and more space to write less efficient software. That is, they dump the parts of software that are really useful and replace them with ""cute"" stuff that takes one, two, three or more mouse clicks to get to or uncover or work with than it did before -- and it always takes up much more space. Win 7 is an example of an upgrade that I refer to as a downgrade. I have been using XP Pro Professional 32 bit for a long time. I tried to install XP Pro 64 bit but it was totally chaotic, so I had to move into Win 7. I purchased my copy at Amazon. Frankly, I'd prefer to return it as ""broken,"" since I think it's a piece of junk. Apparently those who design today's working software (OS and other software) don't actually use it to make a living. In other words, they aren't self-employed and they don't find themselves relying upon a software to be efficient (time is money made or lost, depending on the amount of time a project takes). Certainly, those who designed everything after XP aren't using what they design to make a living . . .they just design stuff that looks cutesy. Take the icons in Win7. No more lists without large icons next to them and we can't make them smaller. No more Windows Explorer, either. Oh, they say they have it, but they don't. What  they have in place of WinExp is a piece of junk that probably works on an iPhone but not at all well on a desktop. I have this brand new high speed, 32 gigabyte RAM computer and it's SLOWER than the one I'm writing this review on. Yes, I have reverted to my 4 gigabyte RAM, 2-core, XP Pro computer when writing or cruising the Net or doing low space requirement work with graphics. On top of Win 7 being inefficient, Adobe has decided to change their software as well. I'm using CS6 on the Cloud with Win 7 and it's taking longer to get things done than with my older CS2 in XP. An example: Adobe dumped their extract from Photoshop and replaced with something that's, Yup, ""cute."" It doesn't extract well at all, though, so I have to keep this CS2 in this computer and do all that work here (Win 7 doesn't like CS2). Win 7 64 bit also demands a high price for replacing all software from the 32 bit, so even though they tell you that you can use the compatibility mode, it's a lie. Yes, you can install into it, but it runs at the same speed as your older computer whether it's 2-core or 4 or 8 core. Compatibility simply means yes, you can install here and using the (86) mode you can run it.

Bottom line is, there's way too much to list here that doesn't prove efficient once Win 7 is installed. I should have written every single major bump in the road down, but I didn't. I just packed up the computer and placed it into my wife's office and said, ""You now have the world's fastest email computer."" So, we have four computers here. Hers with Win 7 and all the rest with XP. Too many programs would not install and we lost the use of three peripherals including one printer, and two scanners.

So, we'll keep on working with old nuts and bolts on three computers and hope that someday, somebody will design fast, efficient, non touch screen OS software that really works and works with all our software.

I would highly recommend you go through the tutorial that comes with the software (it takes about an hour), as it gives you a high level introduction of how to use it.

There is a slight learning curve of what you have to do when you're adding chapters, text within the chapter, etc. and if you're like me you have to go to the online forum where your question has probably been answered.  However, its all pretty straight forward and you can edit / switch stuff around to your hearts content.  One of the many useful features is the ability to store your research material / notes / trash files electronically for reference (but they won't translate over to your final eBook): thats very handy as you're going back to your document either to finish it, refine it, or as in my case updating for a new edition of a reference guide.

After going through the tutorial, compiling an existing book that was originally in Microsoft Word didn't take that long at all.  What I particularly liked was the automatic generation of a linkable table of contents for Kindle-compiled books, but what I wish it had was a way to hyperlink to other pages / sections of your eBook.

If you're considering using this for compiling a Kindle-related book, you will need to install the free Kindle Gen software from Amazon.  It takes all of 15 seconds or so to convert a text into the Kindle format, ready for uploading to Amazons platform online.

At just $40 for the download here on Amazon (as well as from the Literature and Latte website), this will save you a heck of a lot of time.  If you are a self-published author and want to compile your books into the Kindle format on your own vs. hiring someone, Id highly recommend trying the free 30 day trial period before purchasing a license to see if this is for you.

I think it depends on what type of user you are.

If you want to do some fun, different effects easily to your pictures, honestly, Pixelmator isn't for you.  Yes, it can do a lot of manipulation, but there is a learning curve, and to really make it fly you're going to invest hours in learning all its ins and outs.  Casual users would be better off sticking with online free or low-cost manipulators like [...] (my favorite!).

What if you say you really want to get into advanced photo-manipulation and do all kinds of spectacular stuff?  Well then you might want to invest in something high end like Photoshop or a little lower like Aperture.  If you don't have any money you can get GIMP, which is a very powerful program but a little cumbersome to use, for free.

So Pixelmator is stuck in the middle, between the free, easy, less powerful online programs and the very difficult, very powerful, very expensive programs like Photoshop.  If you want more power than what you can get from online editors and have some time to invest to learn the program, Pixelmator would be a good choice.  BUT.... I think most casual users would actually do better to stick with online editors, and most power users will want something with more horsepower like Aperture or Photoshop.

It's not that I've had significant problems with PDVD14 -- not at all. It installed easily and it runs just fine. True, I haven't been able to access my 10GB of ""free"" (no additional charge for one year) ""Cyberlink Cloud"" online storage for reasons that appear to have something to do with the way I set up my account, but pretty much everything else seems to work.

My mistake was not in choosing a product that wasn't up to my needs, but rather in choosing a product that performs some functions I don't need, some functions I don't even understand, and some functions that were already performed perfectly well by other products that I wasn't looking to replace. For example, I don't need any of the nifty 3D-related features because I don't have any 3D TVs or monitors. I had never even heard of 4K UltraHD before I read the description of this product. Nor had I heard of DLNA (the Digital Living Network Alliance) or their plans for making it easier to share video (and other stuff???) across cell phones, tablets, computers, TVs, toasters, and blenders. I frankly don't understand yet whether this functionality does me any good, not least because PDVD14 doesn't make it clear when this would benefit you or talk about what sorts of planning you need to do in order to make it work.

However, ""This program does more stuff than I need it to"" is not a serious complaint. The reason I gave the program 3 stars instead of 4 or 5, however, is that by packing all of these diverse functions into a single program with a single hierarchical left-hand-side menu, they've created an overbearing, unfocused, and confusing piece of software. It's big and it's ugly (admittedly a polished, Windows 8-like kind of ugly, not a low-budget, no sense of aesthetics whatsoever kind of ugly) and it probably should have been broken down into a set of smaller, more focused applications. Rather than designing a program that says to users, ""Hey, let's make your audiovisual experience as cool as possible, and here's how we're going to do it,"" Cyberlink designed a program that says ""Here's a whole bunch of cool functions. Have fun."" If you know exactly what you're doing, you probably will have fun. For the rest of us ... not so much.

As an aside, for me the coolest thing about PDVD14 is the PowerDVD Remote app for Android (and iOS, I think) that allows you to control your PDVD14-powered computer with a phone or tablet. It gives you a pointer and even a keyboard. It's a little awkward to use, but for those without a well-constructed Home Theater PC setup, it's a very nice perk.

Bottom line: PowerDVD 14 Ultra is not a bad product. There's no reason to avoid it. The question is whether or not you need Cyberlink's top-of-the-line playback product. If you want the version with all the bells and whistles and you have money to burn, go for it.

OpenOffice not doing a good enough job for what you need? Are you put off by Office 2013, which doesn't offer three product keys for your trouble? Are you even more put off with Microsoft turning Office into Software as a Service with Office 365?

Well, you're going to have to accept some compromises, namely the hated Ribbon and not having all the Office apps. But there are Z number of people who have late Windows XP/early Windows Vista era PCs that are perfect for secondary production running Windows 7 from a retail upgrade disk-and when you do the clean install upgrade for Windows, which you will eventually have to do due to Windows rot, you are going to need Office and you may never get up the budget to where you want to invest in Office 2010 or later for such a low-end often barely Aero-capable PC, so this is perfect as long as you temper your expectations.

With properly set expectations and a legal copy of Office 2007 Home and Student, you can now get down to how it works.

It works by running basic Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote tasks  It's not going to wow you like a new version of Office, but a common thread I've read in hundreds of reviews for various versions and editions of Office is why do they break what works in the previous version when they release a new version? Well, by buying an older version, there are no surprises as regards what Office can and can't do, because it's been around for however many years it's been since the date the version in question (Office 2007 Home and Student, which is 7 years as of when I write this) was made.

What can it actually do? Well, Word's fully featured (as long as you're using it for home or student use.) Excel is fully featured as regards the base program (again, the same caveat applies.) PowerPoint will get your presentations done, although you'll miss some of the customizations of later versions. OneNote is fully featured, and it along with PowerPoint have the caveat that they're for home or student use. The only thing that really lacks in Home and Student versus let's say Ultimate (which I use for troubleshooting through over-engineering), is the Microsoft Office Tools-you can't expect fancy things like Business Contact Manager and the accompanying copy of SQL Server 2005 Express.

In case you're wondering, I'm reviewing this for my aunt and uncle, who sat there and bought a PC in May of 2009 and thanks to a certain ability I have to troubleshoot combined with them buying retail Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade through the Best Buy fulfillment of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option that was current at the time along with retail Office 2007 Home and Student that they beat out of HP's customer (dis)service-albeit with having to pay for it, I get to (and thoroughly enjoy) troubleshooting their PC whenever it is having an issue because I'm on a mission to keep them off of the crack Windows that is Windows 8/RT/8.1/RT 8.1/Windows Phone 8X/Windows Phone 8.1x and I thoroughly enjoy every time I can fix their PC that uses this software.

Office 2007 Home and Student was a change for them at first from the WordPerfect Office suite they were using on their old XP computer, a Dell Dimension 2400 (They replaced it with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 7750+ 4GB RAM 500GB HD HP Pavilion Slimline S5120Y. But then again so was Vista and then 7-they didn't have too much trouble with Vista, but Windows 7 Home Premium combined with this version of Office makes them able to do everything they would ever want to do with Office and a PC. When that changes, they will upgrade-and so far it's not changing.

I just think that Office 2007 (whether lowly Home and Student or mighty Ultimate or something in between like Professional) didn't deserve the reputation it got as regards the Ribbon. People were (and some still are) so angry about the Ribbon that they don't like Office because of the Ribbon. I know I am not as qualified as some people to speak due to my aversion to command line interfaces, whether of the old school DOS/Unix variety or whether of the newfangled Windows PowerShell variety, but I know this for a fact:

Once I properly configured their PC with Windows 7 Home Premium Retail Upgrade on a clean install and reimported their programs, files, and settings, they were using it productively as could be until a virus hit that forced them to pay someone way too much to repair their computer.

I hate to discount those who have had negative experiences with Office 2007, because I don't like most change-especially not the licensing restrictions growing ever tighter since 2000, but I haven't had any problems with the Ribbon either.

So with the Ribbon discounted for us and our family, we can now move on to infinitely more pressing matters. Which is how does Office (specifically 2007 Home and Student) perform in real world tasks? Well, it doesn't make you have to renew the usage rights to it every year, it supports the .docx/.xlsx/.pptx trio, and it has a user interface that aside from being different is actually usable (if you can figure out what each button on each section of the ribbon is for, which ToolTips really help with that and they're on by default).

In summation, for the reasons outlined above, Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student is worth the money if you can get a legal copy. I recommend it as long as it's needs match up well with what you need out of (specifically Microsoft) Office,

UPGRADE

As an upgrade from Vista Home Premium, it was seemless. I first used Windows 7 Adviser (download available free from Microsoft) to see which version of Windows 7 is right for me. One cannot upgrade willy nilly from any version of Windows to any version of Windows 7. Then, I used Windows Easy Transfer to migrate my data to an external hard drive. I don't think I needed Easy Transfer for the upgrade from Vista, but it came in useful later, when I had to do a clean install.

Upgrading went very smoothly. I retained all my software and settings. I really loved how easy it was.

WINDOWS EASY TRANSFER

It may interest some of you to know sysprep will not work on a computer with an OEM version of Vista with a paid upgrade to Windows 7. I could not even perform a Windows repair with the full version disk. Nope. Once I changed out my motherboard and CPU, I had to use this full version to do a clean install, after which I ran Windows Easy Transfer. Windows Easy Transfer did not restore all my software or even my email settings, but I did give me back my wallpaper.

CLEAN INSTALL

I had to do a few clean installs: the first time after upgrading my motherboard and CPU, the second time after upgrading my hard drive (cloning the old drive failed and my disk backup image did not work). I know, I should have done it all at once.

The first clean install was flawless. The second clean install was fraught with problems. Windows would not let me repair nor do a clean install. ""On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT disks."" Lots of googling to solve this problem, and I did not find anything like what I finally did: I went to the ""advanced"" screen of the Windows setup screen and deleted all the partitions. That worked.

WINDOWS 7 VS. WINDOWS 8 AND VISTA

Compared to Vista, Windows 7 is very familiar. It feels stable. I haven't had it lock up or anything. I like the taskbar on the bottom of the screen. I like being able to see small screenshots of my work by hovering over the icons there. I like anchoring my most used software there.

We do have Windows 8 at home and I chose not to upgrade to that. Windows 8 is very cluttered and clunky. Everything takes far too many clicks, like taking a roundabout route just to turn off the machine. I consider Windows 8 a downgrade.

The traditional size is not made any more, which is bad enough, but to find that these new Hallmark cards do not even have the Hallmark logo embedded on the back flap of the envelope was a disappointment.  This makes it so there is no compelling reason to buy the Hallmark card stock rather than card stock made by your printer manufacturer.  Supposedly, papers made by the printer manufacturer are made to work specifically with that brand ink so why bother to buy the Hallmark paper?  I did notice that the cards seem to go through the HP printer easier with fewer roller marks.  To me though, this is just a matter of two negatives cancelling each other out.  One, the Hallmark paper feels to me to be a bit thinner and the second negative is that HP printer design would leave any roller marks at all on photo card paper made by HP.

Yes, I know others had issues related to what schedules they needed, whether they used the 2013 version and the balky response from Intuit.  No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing).

Three comments about this events:
(1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues.
(2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count).
(3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me.

And, I'm happy to report, it worked great.

I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages.

After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand.

I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment.

No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined.

I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it.

However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit).

What I really like is the large number of video input formats it supports, since I use a large variety of digital cameras and camcorders.

It's also possible that some of my first impressions may change overtime in which case I am going to come back to this review and update it.

WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR (and what not)

I am likely to keep using PowerDVD on my laptop to:

- Watch DVDs discs
- Watch Blu-ray discs
- Watch movies and videos off our media servers (DLNA)

The following features, while present, are either of no interest to me or don't work as I would expect them to work and I will not use:

- Anything 'online'
-- the Youtube player accessed through a browser is superior
-- the 'Movies' feature found under 'Media Library' is just advertising and trailers spam and I don't need that, thank you very much

- Any of the badly implemented or redundant features
-- PowerDVD remote apps, or at least the one available for Android can't find the main PowerDVD I installed on my laptop (Windows 7, 64-bit)
-- PowerDVD mobile apps, or at least the one available for Android can't find the main PowerDVD I installed on my laptop (Windows 7, 64-bit)
-- anything having to do with 'photos' because there are much better apps
-- anything having to do with 'music' because there are much better apps
-- 'Playlists' because they are awkwardly implemented and it's difficult to add items in bulk and/or import existing

- Any of the gee-whiz features such as:
-- the ability to render normal video as 3D video
-- super-high resolution support that's not likely to be available on a monitor connected to my laptop in the foreseeable future

MY EXPERIENCE

The software was easy to install and it installed relatively quickly. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to keep it on the computer where the initial installation took place so I tried to install while offline. After I entered the key, the program told me that it was fine that I will be able to use it without online validation for 30 days (nice). Sadly, as soon as I started the program while online, the program 'validated' itself so I can't move it elsewhere unless I talk to 'customer support', or so the customer support person told me.

Speaking of which, getting tech support does not seem to be that easy. I couldn't get that far through the site's Byzantine menu trees but it appears that any support beyond the most basic topics (installation or, in my case, transfer to another PC) requires the customer to pay some more if a human technician is needed. The alternative is exploring that 'free' FAQ sections which, in my case, didn't have the information I was seeking and appears to be too generic to be worth much.

Once installed - and I am happy to report that no spyware or carpware was forced upon my laptop - the program ran well, it never crashed while playing a disc or a file and was responsive to controls for the features that actually worked (see my notes above concerning the 'remote' and 'mobile' apps.

Playing movies is the main and in most cases the only reason one would buy PowerDVD and it plays movies and home videos well. The program supports about a million file formats and adds some nice features that can enhance the viewing experience:

- there is a set of 'TrueTheater' controls concerning the video and audio quality meant to improve the quality of non-HD content
- it's easy to zoom if you prefer to have more of your screen to be filled
- there is volume control
- has a 3D button that will instantly turn any movie into something you can watch with 3D glasses (a gimmick you'll get tired of after 30 seconds but it's there nevertheless)
- ability to set languages, subtitles and bookmarks

Overall, movie and video playing is near-flawless if the app can actually get to the source.

PowerDVD will play anything off:

- your computer's integrated optical drive, whether it's a DVD or a Blu-ray drive
- an external optical drive
- your computer internal HDD or any external HDD
- a network drive that your computer connects to
- a DLNA server if it can find it

Of course, bandwidth can become an issue when accessing remote sources. I had no issues playing DVD-quality movies off a DLNA server accessed over Wi-Fi or Blu-ray quality media off an external USB 3.0 HDD. Worth to note that it sometimes required a rescan to discover some of my DLNA servers and at least one of them (our PS3) was never detected even though other apps do see it.

Attempting to use PowerDVD for anything other than 'video' was part of my experience but I quickly realized that, as much as the developers tried to expand into other types of media, this version of their product did not persuade me to take advantage of those features, not when it's so easy to get to YouTube from a browser window and there are superior interfaces for photo viewing and organizing.

MY RATING

PowerDVD gets high marks for its ability to play movies and videos and play them well from practically any source and in almost any known format. Some of the 'frills', especially its ability to interact with the 'remote' and 'mobile' Android apps did not work for me but mine could be a special case. Sadly, I will probably never know because getting the PowerDVD 'mobile' or 'remote' to run was not worth paying CyberLink's tech support for actually supporting their app.

I am not likely to ever use PowerDVD to play or organize or interact in any way with the 'other' types of media because there are vastly better alternatives out there. I wish I could say that it was 'nice' that PowerDVD supports 'photos' and allows me to watch YouTube but the truth is that I don't care and I never will.

I didn't like and I don't appreciate CyberLink's customer support scheme. Once users pay for the product (and, yes, the license does state that the product is never 'yours' and the money you gave them only grants you the privilege to access and use CyberLync's property at their discretion) they should expect some decent level of support without being asked to pay more. Support should be about dealing with the product issues and shortcomings, not running a customer nickel and diming profit center.

These being said, my rating subtracts 1 star for disappointing 'support' and another 0.5 star for the unneeded features that add bulk to the software and unnecessarily complicate the program's controls and menu trees. Another 0.25 star is subtracted for the not so flawless DLNA support and for the Android apps not working, coming down to  the grand total of 3.25 stars, fairly rounded down to 3.",Movies and video player,1373155200,40.0,

I did contact them, and we exchanged a few emails back and forth, and I even called them once, but to no avail. They do not have any idea why Quicken behaves like I described, and how to fix it. When I called I had to wait about 5 minutes, and then we talked for about half an hour, but with no results. At some point the representative said she cannot hear me, and I hung up.

1. I have a Merrill Lynch account and I can never understand what goes in the taxes and what doesn't. Well, Turbo Tax went online and collected my account information and put everything in for me... WOW

2. It has a built in program to help you figure out deductions on contributions of material things, that was a big help.

3. They have an optional small fee if you want to have an accountant check everything after Turbo Tax is done, if just to make you feel better.

All in all, it was a lot easier to fill out than I expected. I had NO idea what was tax deductible and what wasn't or what section the deductions went into.

If you don't think the M&M thing is funny for any reason, give this a pass. Not everyone has to see and like every movie.

Personally, I thought the special effects were very good, except for those that were intentionally cheesy to match the TV show, in good fun.

The desert scenes were a real treat, with various objects from Earth (and elsewhere) sticking up out of the sand in various spots. I had a lot of fun just trying to spot all the odd objects scattered about those scenes.

The characters have different relationships than the old show. Holly is ""all grown up"", and very pleasingly so.

And someone bemoaned the character development? They should pay attention. Will's character goes from being a disgraced scientist on a self destructive eating binge to a successful, self confident scientist, his theories validated, who can tell Matt Lauer to ""Suck it"" and get away with it.

I've been a simple Quicken user for more than 10 years, upgrading along the way as Quicken updates yearly.  Updates are clearly just a way to ""milk"" users for more money but we're used to this, like Norton antivirus subscriptions.  But, when I update Norton, my computer still works okay.  I usually kept updating Quicken even though I didn't really need it.  If you get too far behind, the risks and learning curves just get higher.  I only use Quicken as a checkbook and for Bill Pay.  It has been flawless in paying bills so I'm happy about that.  What Quicken does is to release a new and buggy version every year, just before the end of the year.  After about 9 months, the bugs are worked and on the 10th month, they release a new version and here we go again.  I've learned over the years not to upgrade at the earliest opportunity because of bugs and because the upgrade gets cheaper later.  I saw the 2012 upgrade offered in 2011 but I waited. Then, in February 2012, I downloaded TurboTax from Amazon.  This went smoothly.  Amazon then sent me a killer low price Quicken 2012 offer.  Due to stupidity and greed on my part, I took the bait.  I have downloaded a number of s/w programs from Amazon and they have gone smoothly and installed without problems, including Quicken 2012 (not all prior Quicken versions installed without errors).  But, when I ran Q12, I found that I could no longer update my Wells Fargo checking account transactions.  Even though I am a simple (and now studid) user, I need the downloads to help me determine when I will run out of money in my checking account.  I try to not keep any more money there than I have to because very little interest is paid.  I had read about problems with downloads earlier but thought maybe they had been fixed or would not affect me.  So, here I am, what do I do?  I couldn't just ""restore"" my Q2011 version because the download and install didn't save the configuration before the new install (the TurboTax download and install DID save the current configuration).  So, I can't go back to my tried and true Q11 without some risk of losing my data.  I did research on the internet and via help but no solutions.  This is like buying a new car, driving it home, and then having to change the timing belt (by yourself) before you can drive it again.  Wells Fargo, and other banks, offer Bill Pay and it's free or at a nominal charge (6.95 for me versus 9.95 for Quicken).  So, I'm just a little ways away from dumping Quicken for good.  I can understand that new s/w features may have problems but I can't understand how simple things, like downloading transactions, can get broken.  Fortunately, Bill Pay seems to still be working.  It you're smarter than me, at least save your current configuration before installing Q12.

Re-edited 2/13/12 to add the following:  Received a comment on this post from a Quicken support person that I could always ""go back to Q11"".  So, I uninstalled Q12 and re-installed Q11. But YOU CAN'T GO BACKWARDS this way because Q12 REFORMATS your data file.  When I tried to restore the data file in the re-installed Q11, an error message says ""QUICKEN can't read this file""!!!  So, I had to uninstall Q11 and re-install Q12 so I could at least read my data and pay bills.  If Quicken had simply created a Windows Backup file before installing Q12, I would hope that a reversion via Windows Restore would work.  I just don't like taking chances with my data and auto pays and financial records by doing multiple installs and uninstalls.  My solution is to ""eat"" my copy of Q12 and switch to Wells Fargo Bill Pay.  It's free for me ($6.95/mo for some)and I don't have to pay for yearly Quicken bombs and $9.95/mo for Bill Pay.

Just like with the other software available from Family Tree, this software helps you build a tree, create reports, integrate with Ancestry.com, and otherwise learn more about yourself and the individuals with whom you share a common ancestry.

This version of Family Tree takes some time to install, so you might be best off just walking away from the computer for a while as it loads. If you already have an Ancestry.com account, it will take some time to import the data. About 15 minutes worked for me, and my family tree has about 8,000 members. At this point, everything is set- you just use the report tab to run reports and utilize all that the software has to offer.

For those who do not have an Ancestry.com account at present, it is easy to start building a tree. You just enter your personal information along with that of your spouse, plus parents, grandparents, etc. The software will then work its magic and start looking for matches in the database. It provides hints to review and research further, if necessary, to make sure that the hint for that person is correct.

Like other Family Tree Software, this version comes with a free membership to Ancestry.com. In this instance, the free trial is for three months, but I should caution that with this version, you have to enter a credit card number to activate the free offer. This means, of course, that you have to remember to deactivate before the end of the trial, otherwise your credit card will get charged. This is less than ideal, I admit, but it is a common way of doing business nowadays with online services.

Discovering more about ones ancestry can be fascinating and Family Tree Deluxe is a good product for this purpose.

I've been using the 2011 version and I don't see a lot of changes, but I do find that integrating data from the searches is going much smoother.

Then I buy a new version with 3-6 months of Ancestry.com access and then do some more updating.

If that's your plan, decide how much time you want to spend.  If you are just getting started the six month subscription is nice, though three months is a good chunk of time.  The book that comes with this would be helpful for a beginner.  It might even help me if I read it, but that's not going to happen.

Now if you are a serious researcher and expect to keep the online subscription going for years, there isn't a lot of savings to be had by buying this, but you do save a few dollars over the web price.

In fact for years I would just buy ""last year's"" software because I could get web access for 3-6 months for about $20.

YouTube has a wealth of intro/beginner/intermediate/advanced video tutorials for helping one setup, run, and learn about the program.

The software is best for a small business or company that needs reliable accounting software, but doesn't have a full-time or devoted accountant/financial advisor. Familiarity with basic accounting information/behaviors is useful for new users, but you'll find Googling/Wikipedia to be your friend -- I have little accounting/financial background and taught myself how to use the program without much trouble. It's been invaluable for generating financial documents, like invoices, and has given my small at-home business a much more professional 'polish' to financial correspondence and documentation.

I installed this on both PC and Mac platforms.  Installation was easy on a Mac, but I ran into problems on the PC side.  On a Vista PC, it appeared to install but wouldn't run.  I've seen this on Vista, so I knew the solution was to ""Explore"" the CD and right click on the Setup program and choose ""Run as Administrator"" (even though I'm logged in as administrator). This is a Vista problem, not Roxio.  Installation on an XP laptop worked great.

Running it:
You pick your video source and the device format to output it to.  The output formats are iPod, iPhone, and iTV.  Since I wanted it for the new iTouch iPod, I choose iPhone (same video specs and format as the iTouch).  If you view the video on your PC, it won't look good because it's downsampled for the small screen of the iPods.  On the iPod, it will be very good.

The time to make the conversion will depend on your computer.  I tried it on a 90 minute movie. My G5 Mac took about the same time as viewing the video (91 minutes).  On my Duo Core 2 PC, it took about 3/4 of the viewing time to render it (62 minutes).  On my Pentium 4, it took 1 1/2 times the viewing time (136 minutes).

In some cases I am very fortunate, as some lines of my genealogy records so far go back almost 1,000 years.  In other cases because one side of my family recently emigrated (or more accurately, most are still in Iran), I have very little reliable information going back even 50 years.  So I can have both the puzzle and the satisfaction of a ton of information, and I need a lot of good research tools as well as a great way to organize my work.

I've used Ancestry.com before, without additional software, and the difference between the website and Family Tree Maker's GUI is substantial.  It's much faster and easier to work with this software.  I found the included documentation easy to use.  Importing pictures and documents was also easy, which was awesome as I have two very extensive word documents from two relatives that are now preserved for my family to enjoy.  I ran through a bit of the tutorial and found it well made, but the software was intuitive enough that I really didn't need it.  Exporting appears to be very straightforward as well.

For that matter, I put a lot of time into this software and have already exhausted my free month.  In that time I did not encounter any glitches.  Solid software.

Another point about Ancestry.com is that I don't really need a persistent subscription.  I'll get on this kick once in a while, usually just after the holidays, and then I'll go a year or more without having time for it.  This software gives me the best of both worlds as I retain my work and can even update my digital family tree, as well as share it with family when they visit, but I only have to pay for Ancestry.com on months where I'm going to be using it.  All my work is stored locally on my computer.

The different editions primarily pertain to the duration of the included membership.  I have the Essentials edition, which is the one I'd recommend as the best practical value, even though the Platinum costs less per month of Ancestry.com use.  And Ancetry.com is the real deal and will be of tremendous use to most people who are researching their family history.

The family tree viewing is dynamic and intelligently conveys relationship information in a variety of ways, especially for very detailed family trees in the Pedigree mode.  For me this had the effect of making it much more fun to include a lot more information and more relatives on my tree (and actually all of them).  The other effect is that people actually enjoy seeing my family tree, because it is actually easily presented on screen.

These include a System Tuner module that includes a Registry cleanup scanner, Startup Manager, Privacy Manager, a Remote File Lock service that protects important documents remotes by password protected backup, A Trend Micro Toolbar that includes a WiFi detector, keyboard encryption protector to thwart keylogging attempts has also been added. New for 2009 TM also includes a phishing page rating button, A Dashboard to track security threats encountered by the software and a Security Suite protector for your mobile smartphone!

This is the third of four programs (each offering something more) offered by Norton to protect computers. There is Norton Antivirus, Norton Internet Security, Norton 360 and Norton 360 Multi-Deivice.  Norton 360 Multi-Device allows you to add protection to smart phones and tablets as well as computers. Norton also has a line of mobile and tablet security.

Once you purchase this you get a one year subscription. After the year is up you can either buy another year of service from Norton or buy the product from a third party like Amazon. In my case I was given the opportunity to review this for free through the Vine program so jumped at the chance to do so.

One of the nice features with Norton is that once installed it will always update to the latest version of the software you purchased. As a result of this there is no pressure to try the new and improved version because you are getting the newest version of the software you purchased.

When you press the Norton icon you get a screen that has security, identity, backup and tuneup options.  Each option gives you a number of choices such as when to run scans or updates or how to manage identity protection. It is easy to use and ideal for people who are not computer experts.

Norton Safe Search will also appear when I search the Internet.  There is a search box and if you go through it Norton will let you know if a site is safe or not.

One of the things I like about Norton is there is 24 hour live free technical support available for issues with installation or product use in general. I had an issue this year that may have been virus related and I called technical support. The agent addressed my concern and thankfully it was not a virus issue.

Over the past year I have had a couple of warnings that a virus had been blocked.  I have yet to have a virus problem in the years I have been using Norton products.

When you buy a Norton product you get 365 days of updates to keep your computer protected from the latest spyware and virus threats.  I had four months of my subscription left and a Norton agent was able to add that to the year that came with this product.

When I first started using Norton many years ago I would use additional programs for added protection against spyware. I just use Norton now.

Norton was easy to install and is intuitive to use. The main screen is setup to be aesthetically pleasing, with a series of bubbles that you can choose from to drill down to more advanced functions. Unlike other virus programs I have used in the past, it does not become intrusive, causing windows to pop up during routine browsing or software installation. Advanced users will want to make use of the customization, in order to remain protected, yet keep Norton from overstepping its bounds. Norton can take care of threats on its own, or it can be set to ask the user what to do when a security risk is found.

One of the most useful features of 360 is that it can be used to easily set up a backup system. Backing up is an important task that many users overlook, so having an automatic tool takes all the thought out of the process. Norton will help you select which files you want to back up (pictures, video, financial files, documents), how big those files are, how often you want to back up, and the destination of the backup system.

I've owned several Macs running OS X, including the late 2008 aluminum MacBook. Thanks to Boot Camp, I was able to run Windows on my Mac, and when the opportunity to try the Windows 7 Release Candidate came up, I decided to use my Boot Camp partition for just that.

It ran great. I was impressed. After a few months, I found myself spending more time in the Windows 7 partition than in the OS X partition. I finally decided to swap around my partition sizes, and gave Windows 7 the larger chunk of my hard drive, while OS X was re-installed fresh and left unused on a tiny partition. I didn't miss OS X, which is interesting because I've spent many years defending OS X, and countering PC users when they bashed Macs. Still, I was a Mac user. I had Mac hardware. I was certain it was a good value anyway.

Some online friends proved me wrong on that count, too. They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too. I couldn't deny it: I was clinging to my Mac out of brand loyalty, and with Windows 7 on the horizon (and the RC working so well) I could see no reason why I shouldn't switch to PC.

So I did. I sold my aluminum MacBook and picked up an ASUS gaming PC. I removed Windows Vista from the ASUS and installed the Windows 7 RC as my primary operating system, and was pretty happy with it. It ran smoothly and without incident for many months while I waited for the retail release of Windows 7.

Just yesterday I got my copy of Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade, and I have to say that installation went well. I was up & running in less than an hour, and had my previous Windows Backup restored to my new OS within another 40 minutes. I did have to spend a little time re-downloading some things like Firefox and Thunderbird, but those things are to be expected with a fresh install. The cool thing is that Windows 7 remembered that the RC I was running was an ""upgrade"" from a legitimate Windows Vista installation, and so I wasn't bugged, prompted, or tasked with proving my ownership of Vista. It just *knew* and went ahead with the installation.

Once installed, activation was simple and took a few seconds online. You need not fear MS activation now, as they're a lot less touchy than they were when Windows XP first showed up.

So what do I like about Windows 7? On a really basic level, I like that I can play Direct X games, where the Mac was a little short in the gaming department. But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment. Sidebar gadgets are nice, too. Windows also did a good job ripping off the ""Sticky Notes"" application from the Mac, and I use that quite a bit.

The big negative for most people in switching to Windows 7 will be the lack of an email client. For me it's no big deal because I use Mozilla Thunderbird (free and open-source). For people used to Windows Mail or Outlook Express, you'll either have to switch clients, or make a purchase.

Best of all, Windows 7 is not a resource hog. I gained a lot of performance going from Vista (the original OS in my ASUS laptop) to Windows 7 RC, and the retail release is no different. Things work better, and Windows 7 takes advantage of my 4GB of RAM. It helps to be running 64-bit, though. It's a good thing Microsoft included both 64-bit and 32-bit DVDs in the case. No mail-in upgrades, here!

If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that. After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC.",Good Enough to Switch from Mac to PC,1256256000,41.0,

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).","Expensive, but worth it! painless and powerful",1099440000,,

CorelDraw would be an ideal solution for a small business or organization that does a fair amount of advertising-creation and publication design in-house. With one application (well-priced when compared to buying both Illustrator and InDesign), the content creator can achieve very professional results.

The app is also friendly to first-time users. It offers more than 80 customizable document templates that will be useful to newbies. While there is still a learning curve for new users, the app has an intuitive interface that will help get the user up and running relatively quickly.

The problem for CorelDraw is that Illustrator has become the default vector app in the design/pre-press community. Professionals should still start with Illustrator and Quark and/or InDesign -- they're the industry standards. While CorelDraw is very good, it would need to be awesome to unseat Illustrator, and that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

CorelDraw has new file formats that enable docs to be shared between CorelDraw and Adobe apps. This is handy, but also shows which format and apps are the most common -- Adobe's. If you're in a design situation where you're going to have to worry about your files working in Adobe formats, you should just go ahead and use Adobe products.

Another thing: Because the Adobe products are the standard, there are numerous training DVDs and books to purchase that can help you get the most out of your apps. With CorelDraw, not so much.

I feel bad for good apps like CorelDraw. I wish I could talk just about the app itself and not bring in a discussion about Adobe's competitive products, but given the way the design industry works -- or any technology-based industry, for that matter -- you always have to bring the front-running application into the mix.

That being said, if you're not a graphic designer or a pre-press operator but are instead a multitasking, Windows-based employee at a company or organization who has been put in charge of creating brochures, pamphlets and the like, CorelDraw will answer your needs very well. If you're someone who doesn't need to share files often with design colleagues, publishing clients or service bureaus (who are most likely using Adobe apps almost exclusively), then you have no worries.

BTW, if you're already using CoreDraw, it's worth the upgrade. The font-identifying tool alone makes it worth it, at least for me.",A great solution for non-professional designers,1219881600,4.0,

When installing the Power Director 13, Make sure you read the EULA, I cannot emphasize that enough.
The Power Director has Many editing tools, and the thought that springs to mind is maybe it has too many or too much in the way of tools; with some products you feel like saying, just focus on a few things that you do well, and do that or do those.

In the Install process, it asks ""do you want to install Smart Sound"", and this is a no brainer; quite a good add-on, and works well with other products.
I favour the use of Still photos, and making them ""pop"" for want of a better phrase, and there-in lies my learning curve. You can use video from the SAMSUNG memory cam which is really for basic Video. Some quite good video can be obtained from the Canon Eos T5, and then you just edit. If you have Photo shop, this can work some wonders , since a live shot with reminisces  of other times, or maybe some people who have passed, can be trasnitioned in as the person on the video talks. When you use this, Audio tracks work wonders; you can have a basic music track, and then if you have audio of the person who has passed, or other people talking about a person ( alive or passed ), then this product can transition the audio, and the images. So cool.

Make sure that you have plenty of memory, and if needs be, use a dedicated PC or , laptop or desktop, with at least 12 gig ( mine has 12 ) so that you can easily edit the large slab of content. If you have less than 12 gig of ram, use more virtual memory, and shut down unnecessary applications so you can grab all the available CPU and memory. I am not a fan of the Cloud option, so forget that, in my view. And use a second drive. If you have a SSD drive, use that for your virtual, especially if you can link that in with a USB 3 cable.

All in all this is a great editing set. Also, if you really feel like using the second disc with optional extras, be careful, since it chews up CPU and memory like crazy.
The capability is immense, but make sure you have the tools to use this great product . Some of the specs for memory and CPU on the box seem more than a tad optimistic, and I would say that easily you would need to double it. I have had problems at times with 12 Gig, and I was being careful. The 3 D options are neat. Also, use a Blue Screen or neutral colour backdrop for some elements you want to import, especially if you do a kind of interview scenario for the PIP ( picture in Picture) elements. If you read the guides and use your imagination, this tool, plus some great extras like Tascam portable audio recording ( 2 and 4 channel options) make for a ""skies the limit"" type of ability.

The install, though, took forever.  It was much, much slower than installing from a disc.  It picked up last year's return and entered the information quickly and correctly (last year I also used TurboTax).  Entry of this year's data was intuitive and alerted me to all possible issues.

Cons:  Expensive  (Amazon had the best price).  Very slow install- 60+ minutes.  I had a couple of unusual items that TurboTax would not let me easily enter regarding dependents.  It incorrectly gave an overestimate of the refund until the final check due to some tax credits it wanted to allow that I did not qualify for.

Pros:  Intuitive guide for entering your current year's information.  Comprehensive coverage of most tax situations. Direct link to ItsDeductible for entering and storing your charitable deductions.  Very easy to send your tax returns to the IRS and state.

I upgraded to 2012 last month, and have been using it daily to evaluate it against the previous year's release.  Since I am familiar with the Quickbooks software, I tried out some of the new features first.  I have several different accounts in my file, and 2012 includes the option to assign different accounts different functions.  I have found this extremely useful for integrating aspects of my personal account with my business account, and I think it will make things easier at tax time as well.  If you have multiple accounts, I think you will definitely enjoy this feature. Unfortunately, that is the only new feature I really could see a use for.  I found the others appeared to be thrown in for the sole purpose of being able to release a new version.

I expected the 2012 Mac version to be a mirror image of the Windows version, however there are noticeable differences and features missing. The most important to me, is that my financial institution for my personal accounts does not support it. While this would seemingly be a problem on behalf of the financial institution, when I compared the lists of support for the two systems, I noticed it is fairly significant.  Why not have an option for converting the file formats like my genealogy software has?  If there is such a thing, I could not find it anywhere.  The second thing I noticed is that several of the reports I frequently used in 2011 for Windows are completely missing in the Mac version.  I realize that there are many more X86 systems than Mac, but the lack of some of these features make Quickbooks for Mac 2012 seem more like an afterthought than a quality piece of software.

Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing.

The package notes the Parent's Choice award for version 20 on the back so we still thought we'd be okay.  It says it works for Windows 7 and it did install (although I needed to input my administrator password), but then we got a shock when we started the software.  Instead of getting the menu shown on the box to take a lesson, play games or whatever, our menu said only 'teacher' or 'student'.  Turns out the software was for a classroom.  The password required to set up the 'teacher' option, without which the 'student' option wouldn't work, was said to be in the administrative manual.  Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.

Since the package is opened, I can't take it back to the office supply store where it was purchased and will have to mail the software and receipt to the company (address in 1 pt font which requires a magnifying glass to read) and the refund will take 4 to 6 weeks.  I tried calling the number on the website and got a ridiculous phone menu run around.  After listening to the options and choosing the one that seemed to apply another recording said a representative couldn't help and to interface with the web instead.  Surely I'd just chosen the wrong option and called again choosing the other option, but got the same message.  Why would there even be a phone number to call if they aren't taking calls.  Very annoying.

I can't speak to the software we expected to receive because we didn't get it, but potential buyers should know that if you have a problem, there is no support.

I have also done remarkable graphics work from Corel PhotoPaint and CorelDraw for years too, often having rave comments from other graphic artists who assumed I had been using Photoshop or Illustrator.

I had lost track of WordPerfect for a while, but with the X6 package, am amazed at how superior this product is compared to the Office Products that I had been forced to use due to computer issues.  What a breath of fresh air to be using WordPerfect Office instead.  I was hoping to have some problems to warn about or pointers to give, but so far, it is pretty easy and problem free for me!

So far, I have not had any problems translating files from Corel to Microsoft file formats, nor have I had problems reading files sent to me from the newer Microsoft programs.

The Quattro Pro spreadsheet program was great too- easy to use and follow.

The templates are helpful and useful as well.  I have used several of them when I am in a hurry and don't know what else to do.

The help files are all searchable online now so it is easier to access instead of having to pull out a manual.  I will say that the search engine is not always the greatest so you might have to play around with words until you find what you want.

I am still working on exploring all of the program that I can, as it is really enjoyable to use and work with.

I will continue to update as I learn more about the program and if I run into any problems worth mentioning.

I am using this currently with Windows XP but plan on transferring it to my Windows 7 machine I am putting together soon and will update with my experiences there as well.

As with all of the Corel choices, the price point alone makes it amazing, but the ease of use and lack of problems I have had so far make it truly worth taking a look at.

My main complaint was that the date field would revert to the current date whenever I temporarily left the entry to do something else. Frequently I ended up with several incorrect dates and had to go back and fix them.  Also I should mention that I only use the check registry and no other features.  This annoyance has been mostly corrected. You can go to Find, for example, and then return to the entry and the entered date will still be there.  If you wander too far, the date may revert, but the main problem has been resolved.  So far as I am concerned, this would be the main reason to upgrade from the 2008 version.

I did not find the new features useful.  I cannot make the ""flag"" feature do anything, so I gave up on it.  Now I would like to make OCCASIONAL use of the Tag and Notes features, but to do that, I would have to make them  available.  The problem is that this would add two extra keystrokes when entering a check as the Amount column is at the end.  Quicken claims that you can arrange the register's columns anyway you like, but I found I could not move the Amount column to be next to the Category field so as to avoid the extra keystrokes.  You would think that fields that are not used for every entry would be placed after the Amount field which has to be filled in for every entry.  Of course one could theoretically hide Tag and Notes and call them up only when needed, but surely the information on them ought to be visible all the time so that one does not overlook it. In any event, it is much easier to stick a notation into the Memo field rather than call up two other fields from time to time.

In all fairness, I think the Attachment feature might be useful but I have not yet have had occasion to try it.
In conclusion, if you do not yet have a program for keeping track of your checks or finances, I would strongly recommend Quicken Deluxe 2011.  Over the many years I have used Quicken, it has undoubtedly saved me hundreds of dollars in duplicate contributions or extended subscriptions, and thousands of hours of time. But if you already have a version of Quicken that works on your computer, and which you like, you may not need to upgrade.","Annoyance removed, but still not perfect",1292889600,,

Coming from a more robust version of Norton's anti-virus software to this version has proved an easy transition though not one without hiccups.

--------------------
INSTALLATION:

I received the physical disk format, however, after installing the disk and starting the installation wizard the recommended method was internet download... go figure. So I went along with that route and very quickly >15min downloaded and proceeded installing my software. Strangely the first time I entered my authentication code Norton's site indicated that my code had been previously used. I tried the code again about 20 minutes later and it worked. I should mention that if you have any anti-virus software already installed you should go ahead and uninstall it anyway as Norton will prompt you to do so.

Note that you will be prompted to create an account Norton/Symantec during installation.

--------------------
USE:

The Internet Security user interface (UI) is very familiar to me. It is basically populated with some easy to identify tiles: 'Secure' (color coded to indicate threats on your machine; green = good; 'Scan Now' which brings up a sub-menu for all types of system security scans; 'Live Update' for downloading the latest security definitions and patches; 'Advanced' for configuration. The tiles also display pertinent information including CPU usage (monitoring for spikes which are an indicator of a potential rogue application) and even when the latest definitions were downloaded and installed. The UI is good, easy to navigate, and unobtrusive.

I have this software installed on 3 machines - my primary desktop that has a SSD, 4-disc RAID storage array, and a networked NAS; along with two laptops all running Windows 7. I've found that Norton has done a great job on each system. Scan times vary, however, on my 300Gb SSD a full scan takes approximately 40-minutes for reference.

As I was already and have continuously used anti-virus software I didn't find any surprises on my systems after running my initial post-installation scans.

--------------------
USAGE NOTES:

It's perhaps just my impression but it seems that software companies tend to treat their customers a bit poorly on licensing. Norton is no exception. This software is licensed to you, you don't ""own"" it rather than lease a window of operation. That's fine and something that we've all sort of become accustomed to, however, the major problem is that this software will stop operating completely once it's 365 day operating license (the day you activate the key) is up. Prior to 2010 (as far as I can remember) Norton software would at least keep functioning outside of the subscription period though obviously not getting new updates and definitions.

The bottom line, and this is true for a lot of software and particularly anti-virus software is that you're going to have a costly bill due every year whether from Norton, Trend Micro, McAfee or whatever security company. You can mitigate this somewhat by buying last years anti-virus product. As long as the activation code hasn't been used you should be good to go. Remember that your license period doesn't start on the calendar year but only after the key is activated.

--------------------
ISSUES:

I don't usually install a lot of extensions in my browser but for some reason went ahead with Norton's Internet Security extension. This was a mistake! I'm a Chrome user and noticed that my browser immediately become slower, and prone to frequent crashes that killed every open tab. I had nothing but issues with the browser extension so I do not recommend using it, especially if you're a Chrome user!

Norton delivers another solid release of their seminal anti-virus software. Performance is good, obtrusiveness is kept at a relative minimum. Be wary of renewing online through Norton as you'll always pay top-dollar. Recommended with caveats.",Norton Delivers Solid Software,1385337600,19.0,

They invest their all into a fine application - which this is - but the market is inherently limited to those who want to produce 3D renderings. There are many people who would love to do that, but it is a difficult undertaking.

 So the marketers claim it is an easy thing to do, that learning how to do it is simple. They laughed when I sat down to create a 3D rendering of a woodland nymph . . . and they were right.

 Creating 3D renderings isn't simple, though the folks who publish Poser try to make it easier with each new version. I own several of the earlier versions and, speaking generally, would give up in minutes.

 Poser 9 is an excellent product, but it has a fairly steep learning curve and possessing artistic talent is not optional, it is a requirement. They include a ton of content and the interface is usable. There are a couple of books about using Poser and picking up a used copy of one for an earlier version is a good investment.

 If you have the time, though, and the discipline to work through each step, you can master Poser 9.

 Personally, considering the low level of my skills, I prefer Reallusion iClone and Daz Studio: they're not necessarily as capable as Poser 9, but they are somewhat easier for novices to approach.

 But, as I said, if you can devote the time and energy to learning Poser 9 and practice, practice, practice, you can turn out truly exquisite work with this application. I just wish I could.

This and a whole lot more is available online utilizing the built in resources family tree taps into.

The really interesting thing is that since it is so widespread that others even distant relatives who have participated and did the leg work to build the tree can be imported into your own tree. The Platinum version includes a six month membership into Ancestry.com which is no small feat because that is about ninety dollars worth of membership. This deluxe version provides 3 months. Even if you bought family tree maker and used it for 6 months you could find just about all of the information that you would need. With the Platinum version the fact that another disc with the platinum version is included in the box to give to someone else, enables you to partake on the journey with another family member, although a second membership into Ancestry is not included.

In using it I found that just like any other application there is a slight learning curve. They included a thick book with it so this is not something you just sit down and become an expert at in an afternoon. That is a good thing because the deeper you want to get into it, the more complex the program becomes.

I always envied those families that we still all together. They had certain bonds that made it that way. For example even though flaw abound, they stuck together, never back sliding one another.

My Mom grew up with relatives galore; by the time I came into the picture it was splintered apart. Who offended who? The interesting thing is that I have a huge family out there. My grandmother's sister had 7 children; most of them live in the area I am sure. The older generation passed away, and maybe the offenses passed with them. I am not disrespecting the older generation, I love them, but I would like to see if this huge family can become a family again. It is a new time, and who hated who is irrelevant.

I have someone I know who has a huge family and once a year they rent out this park where they have an outside picnic, everyone brings a dish.

Instant Immersion makes the mistake (for me, anyway) of going through all the basics first - numbers, months, days, blah blah. Useful but boring. Pimsleur says the same phrase umpteen times. And so on. So this approach seems the best so far in terms of interest, and some of my comments will seem like nitpicking, but it could be better.

Rosetta starts with matching words to pictures, and includes hearing, speaking, reading, and writing. You can choose which of these activities to include, but you can't fine tune it to have just reading and no writing. You have the option of displaying simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, pinyin, or both. If you choose both, however, the pinyin is shown above the script in a font that's a little too small for easy reading on a 13.1"" or 14.1"" laptop screen. The title text at the top is also unclear, even on fullscreen, because it's antialiased, but that's not a huge problem, since it doesn't affect the lesson. Other than that, the interface is bright and pleasant and refreshingly different from the normal Windows dialogs.

The lessons available are limited to about half the full content until you activate the product, i.e. tie it to one PC. I've heard horror stories about transferring the activation, so be warned.

The picture/word matching thing seems to work for the most part, but there are sometimes problems. Is that a boy or a girl? What are they doing? Hard to say at first glance, since they use a couple of different pictures for the same word. Also feels strange to match ""he is not doing this""-type phrases to the pictures of someone ... er ... not doing it.

Because it's an immersion-type course, sometimes you have to figure out what's going on with little or no explanation - for example the different numeratives (""one tail of fish""). You aren't told why a bicycle is called what it is. But that's part of the immersive learning process.

The program defaults to moving along automatically. Problem is, there are pages where it should stop for you to review, but it doesn't - it moves along after a second or two. If you set it to manual, you have to advance by clicking on the button for the next lesson - from a tiny row of boxes at the bottom. That could've been designed better.

In general, response is slow - a couple of seconds to get to the next page, for instance. It's a little annoying because you're not sure if the program recognized your input, so ... get used to it, or get used to clicking twice just in case.

I've heard many actors simply butcher Mandarin in movies or on TV (Serenity *cough*). For those of you having trouble with the accent, may I suggest that you think of it in terms of singing the phrase, see if that helps.

Is it worth it? If you want to learn the language at your own pace, and the price is within your budget, I would say yes. I give it three stars because of the price and the room for improvement - and the activation requirement. Considering what you pay for it, you shouldn't be treated like a criminal or inconvenienced in that way.","Probably the best out there, but could still be improved",1221696000,11.0,

I, of course, uninstalled McAfee first, before trying to install Kaspersky, only to be told there was still something left on the PC by McAfee, that was blocking the installation of Kaspersky.  That sort of thing makes me cringe!  I then went to ""techincal assistance"" or whatever it was called, on the Kaspersky CD, and immediately saw a question about what to do if a third party security system was blocking installation. Clicking that in, I discovered there were tools for McAfee, Norton's, etc. to remove the problem file. Clicking in McAfee took me to the McAfee file, which I opened, and that started the removal process.

After then going back to installing Kaspersky, I got my old friend Error 1500. That has nothing to do with the Kaspersky software, and everything to do with my PC or Vista.  (For the solution to that error, please read my review of Corel Photo Album 7.) After fixing the Error 1500 problem, Kaspersky installed immediately.  I then had to update, since this version of the software is so old.  That went quickly also, thought I was hooked up to my sister's high speed router, and not my usual dial-up connection...so, I don't know how fast or slow the update would have been with dial-up. Next, I did a full scan, and Kaspersky found 4 infected files with something ""very dangerous"" in them.

Two weeks later, the daily updates for Kaspersky install very quickly, even on dial-up.  And they don't slow down my PC.  McAfee's updates slowed down my PC, and sometimes they were so long, I had to go hook up my laptop to my sister's high speed router to do them.  McAfee had a maintenance feature, though, and this version of Kaspersky does not; so, I'm going to have to remember to start doing maintenance PC stuff now.  Also, interestingly, Kaspersky does not have a firewall, although it does have spyware protection.  Thus, you must use your Windows firewall, which is fine with me...as long as I don't have to use Windows Defender!

These new features are fitting for the current economy and will appeal to buyers to view their shrinking net worths and help them get out of debt.  Genius marketing and product enhancement! ;-)

This review is for upgrading from Quicken 2011 to 2012.  In summary don't expect a lot of feature enhancement, and 2012 appears to be a (mostly) stable release.  I'm a long time Quicken user who upgrades annually.  I use Quicken extensively and my data file is 125Mb with accounts which have thousands of transactions, some dating back to 1993.  The upgrade and conversion from Quicken 2011 to 2012 was seamless.  All of my connections (mostly Direct Connect) to financial institutions worked as they did before.  There are some cosmetic enhancements to the user interface.  I noticed some but not significant performance improvements (I use Quicken on Windows 7 32-bit running on a mid-performance dual core laptop with 4GB of RAM).  Interfacing to financial institutions and downloading transactions appears to have some stability improvement.  There are still some bugs from prior versions which I have learned to work around.  Occasionally Quicken crashes or hangs-up; however, I have never lost transaction data in this version or prior versions.  I can't comment on the enhancements to budgeting and debt cutting tools as I don't use them.

The software is probably getting long in the tooth and requires significant changes to its core architecture.  Quicken was originally designed as a replacement for the checkbook and not managing thousands of investment transactions.  For instance a 401(k) account with an asset allocation among several funds and an employer match which makes purchases each pay period results in thousands of downloaded transactions over a few years.  In the portfolio view, Quicken is painfully slow when displaying an account with many transactions.

With a shift towards cloud computing and use of tablets/mobile devices (and Intuit's acquisition of mint.com), Intuit is unable to significantly invest in the architectural changes required for the existing desktop version of Quicken.

I found the product was cheaper on Amazon.com, so I bought it here with no ""discount"".

One major gotcha is the Quicken automatically scans your history for recurring payments and creates reminders for them.

On one DVD, you are getting essentially a textbook with a few extras that will be good for years to come. I think this is a good reference for several different types of mathematics that students will encounter from middle school through college, but in all honesty, I purchased it with my daughter in mind. She's currently taking Pre-Algebra in 6th grade and I wanted to give her a leg-up by offering a supplement at home that was not her textbook.

After playing with the software myself these are my impressions.

INTERFACE: How it Looks

This program is not overly appealing visually, but it's not terrible either. If you have the sound on, the voices (several are used depending upon where you are in the program) are a bit boring. Can anyone really fix that one though?  In parts of the program the makers use a space-age theme; in the Algebra Booster for example, there is a math game designed to help kids think algebraically while doing a Pac-Man type game. I played it and found it to be 'OK'.  My 11 year old wasn't overly impressed, but I think she was expecting it to play like her other video games. Bottom line: It really looks like something from 1999 versus 2009.

CONTENT:  What's on the DVD?

For each of the math subjects: Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I... through Calculus and Statistics, there are tabs at the top of the screen.

 ""Lessons"" has subcatagories of 'Basics' and 'Chapters'.  This is basically like a textbook or reference book that you can read when you need it.  Another tab, ""Challenge"" is a problem that in the end asks you questions, but I didn't find an answer to the question... just more questions.  I guess it's designed to help students think a bit deeper.  The third tab is ""Exercises"", which as you would imagine has questions relating to whatever subject inside a math type you are studying.  If you get the wrong answer, it tells you you're wrong, but since they are multiple choice, you never get an explanation, you just get to choose again.  You can view your score and get a report on which ones you got right and wrong to review.  ""Real Life"" is a story problem.  Using the current skill set to solve an every-day issue.  ""Animation"" is a short video illustrating the current skill. It's the company's attempt to 'cartoon up' the software. For visual learners this will be helpful, but the few I viewed were kind of stupid.

The DVD also has bonus applications:  Runes of Avalon and Calculus Ipod material.  I couldn't get the link for the ipod material to open on my computer despite having iTunes and an Ipod Touch, but the game, Runes of Avalon, did install and I played it. It's more a spacial recognition game versus a math game, but it looks good (better than the rest of the software) and the gameplay was smooth.

A strange addition to the package was a CD with animal screensavers on it. The animals look like they are licking your monitor clean. Cute, but seemed like it fell into the wrong box!

CONCLUSION: Would I buy it again? Was it what I was looking for in math-help software?

I got a heck of a deal on this one - under 10 dollars when the local warehouse store was still selling it for over thirty. If I'd paid more, I probably would be a bit irked, but for the money paid... I'm happy. I would buy it again and recommend it as a 'reference' source.

As for whether it was what I was looking for... yes and no. I expected explanations of the subjects listed. I got that and examples, just like a textbook would offer. What I didn't get was the ability to print off worksheets and answer sheets for practice. That would have been great! I found a few places online with free worksheets and some paid sites, but I had hopes that this would offer this and it didn't. Some more games would have been great too, as would the ability of the software to give feedback on a step-by-step basis, versus simply 'wrong' and then you figure it out.

This is a good math resource for any math students seeking a supplement to their current textbook, but it is not software that's filled with useful games and printable worksheets.

Unfortunately, any Internet user has to be aware of how these words can affect how safely they navigate the Internet today. They have become as normal a part of Internet culture as an email address or facebook membership. If you are careful, and I mean *really* careful, you can get away with using the Internet without a ""security"" product--or more likely these days, a suite of products. I know some who do this without issues, but they're all systems administrators with decades of security administration under their belts. Most however should not venture out into the wild unprotected.

Enter Kasperksy. I have used various other A/V (anti-virus) programs in the past--McAfee is the choice anti-malware at my work--and there are a few things I judge them by, starting with what I call the overhead factor. Because these programs run constantly, just how much CPU time and system memory do they require? Like a good butler, I judge these programs by how little I notice them until (hopefully not) I need them. Of course, there are other judging criteria such as the heavily important one of how effective it is in catching and eradicating malware, and then how easy is it to use and finally, what's the upkeep? Downloading updates, how often the virus signatures are updated, etc.

I'm happy to say that Kasperky AV 2009 scores quite highly in each of the above departments. The installation itself was simple although not quick. On my Vista 32-bit Ultimate PC, it took almost 25 minutes and one restart to get it installed. In addition, it took a few more minutes to install updates; in total, set aside about an hour to get it installed and fully operational. This is a bit long, as you may imagine.

Thereafter, but for one little problem [update below], Kaspersky ran without problems. It was quite straightforward to configure and the reports of its activities are easy to read. The memory and CPU overhead are minimal considering what it does which is categorized in three general areas: anti-malware, system security and online security. For anti-malware, we have files and memory security, email and IM security and web traffic security. System security covers what it calls ""proactive defense,"" which means it protects against the usual suspects (Trojans, worms, keylogger detection, hidden driver installation, OS kernel modifications--this is not a default however--and hidden object detection).

Setting all of these via the intuitive GUI is ... well, intuitive. There are some great real-time graphs of system and software activity which is all logged for later reference. Statistics are kept for a year while reports are kept, by default, for 30 days or 1GB whichever is less. It's all quite simple to manage.

The problem I spoke of before has to do with a pet peeve of mine and the reason I uninstalled McAfee from this very same computer. I fly online with Flight Simulator on a network known as VATSIM. Both McAfee and Kaspersky prevent normal operations of multiplayer function on VATSIM (and some others, I've heard) even though you have paused protection. I would like to be able to completely turn off anti-virus protection when I want and not have it actually continue to work regardless of setting.
[Update: Boy, was I wrong! Kaspersky does not interfere with VATSIM traffic. I'm not sure why it happened a time or two when I tried initially, but I've since discovered there are no issues whatever with running Kaspersky and VATSIM concurrently. This could have been because of the numerous updates to the software, but regardless, this bumps it up into the 4.5 star class.]

Apart from this, I judge Kaspersky A/V 2009 to be a top player in the field. I only wish the free update time period would be for more than one year for what it's worth, but that's a measure of how valuable I believe the software to be.

If you currently have Delorme 2007 or newer I would not advise upgrading because this version doesn't offer any needed enhancements that we use nor have I seen much of an update to road data.

I love having the Plus version over the regular version because having all that directory information at my fingertips can really make traveling a lot easier.  If the kids say they are hungry, you ask Street Atlas where the closest restaurant you love is on your route and it will spit out a list of options.  Then you can call ahead and set up reservations because Delorme gives you the phone numbers as well as the address to the restaurant.

I have used both Delorme and Microsofts mapping programs and I am much happier with Delorme due to the ease of use of GPS navigation.  Also, I have found that Delorme's routes are much more intuitive to road conditions and always seemed to get us to our destination faster than Microsoft.

From the initial installation, you will notice that your Mac is snappier - and if you look at the space on your hard drive, you'll see that installing Snow Leopard has freed up more than a few gigabytes of space.  As you go about your normal workflow, you'll start to stumble onto things that are just - well - better.  I'll give you one example.  I decided that I wanted to relocate my iTunes Library, but that I didn't want it to take an entire drive.  I have several 1TB externals, and one looked tempting.  But it was formatted with a single partition.  I did a brief search in the Mac help section and was delighted to find that I am no longer stuck with static partitioning on formatted drives. In the past, if I wanted to resize a partition, it was a complicated process, first backing up all data on the drive, then using disk utility to reformat and then partition the drive, and finally copying my data to the new partitions.  With Leopard, all that is consolidated into one step.  In disk utility, I can select the ""partition"" option, drag the size of my existing partition to release space on the drive (or type in a number to specify exactly how big I want the partition to be!)  Then create a new partition or partitions in the empty space - No loss of data, no reformatting, dead simple.  This is a powerful feature, which used to require third party software to accomplish.

I have not yet started using the video editing functionality.

My standard tools for this sort of work have been Adobe PhotoShop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator and some ftp tools. I found that everything which I have done with these more expensive tools was easy to do with CorelDraw Premium Suite X5. A couple of highlights include:

 - Corel Capture. I use screen shots all the time for user documentation, etc. The Corel Capture software that comes with this package offers some handy ways of capturing screen data, as well as content from other sources. It can capture other content such as video playing on part of your screen. It is a handy tool in general.

 - Corel Draw is their answer to Illustrator. Illustrator and I are not particularly close as I lack a skill that is key to its successful use - artistic talent. That being said, Corel has all of the tools that you would need to make the full range of vector drawings and art work you can do with Illustrator. I have a feeling that Adobe is always a year or two ahead in functionality, but Corel then works to add features pioneered by Adobe.

If you are a casual user of the various tool sets offered in these packages, Corel can save you a lot of money without sacrificing functionality.

I first encountered this while looking for good software for my coworkers to use to edit short web videos.  These are people, myself included, with regular office jobs who just need the ability to edit video one or two times a year and we keep one computer with graphics software for those occasional times when someone needs it.  We already has access to Adobe Primere, but it is far too busy an interface for someone who does not have a big amount of time to invest at the very beginning in learning how to use it,  In contrast, the Pinnacle Studio line of software has a good balance of having the tools to allow me to do lots of projects while still keeping the interface clean so that it is intuitive and easy to figure out how to do something.  If you want to do serious editing but haven't done much editing before, then this is a good product to get.  Most of the time when I know in my head what I want to do, it is easy to figure out how to do it or to search online and find instructions on how to do it,

Pinnacle makes three editing programs: Studio (in the 60 dollar range), Plus (in the 100 dollar range), and Ultimate (in the 130 dollar range).  The biggest difference is that Plus and Ultimate let you do screen capture as well as editing.  That's a nice feature.  Good basic scree casting software is a must for me.  Another difference that matters is that Ultimate has added features to clean up audio quality.  Other differences don't matter to me as a casual user.  For example, Plain old Studio not Ultimate not Plus only lets you work with 6 tracks at once, while Plus is 24 tracks and Ultimate is unlimited.  That limit doesn't bother me because I'm just doing short web videos and usually just deleting bloopers or doing a little audio clean up.  Pinnacle has a chart on their website comparing the software features.  The most compelling reason to get Ultimate is that that way if you google for instructions on how to do something in Pinnacle Studio, then those will definitely apply to something your product will do.

Overall this is a really great piece of software if you want to do some serious video editing but that is not your full time job.

The ""start menu"", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the ""start menu"" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, ""ME"" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. ""KODAK"". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro.

- It comes with lots of fun and practical built-in filters.
- You can crop, straighten, fix red eye, add text, convert to black and white or adjust colors/saturation

ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
- You can clone items
- Remove scratches  and unwanted objects
- Apply special effects like time warp (to make photos look old)
- Selective Focus
- Distortion

This software allows you to apply layers which gives you the freedom to experiment with different looks and still keep your original image until you are ready to merge them.

We own a small LLC, so each year we have to buy TT Business at nearly $100 and TT Deluxe @$60, which seems prohibitively expensive. We consider this parceling of the software for a two person LLC to be a rip-off.

But, this year we discovered another rip-off, when we learned that TT Deluxe is ""crippleware"" when it comes to calculating capital gains from buying and selling stocks. Like a lot of folks, we have an Ameritrade brokerage account, so we can buy and sell a few stocks, which we did this year. Ameritrade likes their customers and provides a great piece of software called GainsKeeper, to calculate the cost basis of each stock transaction.

Now, here's the rub: TT Deluxe is SUPPOSED TO import this data from your Ameritrade or other account. However, this feature does not work properly, ESPECIALLY if you bought a stock, say APPLE, in more than one lot. The import feature only pulls in the basics of the listing for each stock transaction, so you get to RE-ENTER all the data, from Ameritrade, FROM SCRATCH. WHAT A JOY!!!

Meanwhile, the software displays a sales pitch dialog encouraging you to spend another $30 to immediately upgrade to TT PREMIERE!!

What a ripoff! I can't believe how INTUIT is doing this to their customers! I would not have bought TT DELUXE if I knew (which I could not have known) that it would not import my stock purchases correctly. Worse, if you back up and EXPORT the data from Ameritrade in a TTF file, the software will IMPORT the file, but will not RECOGNIZE any of the stock transaction data, which indicates that INTUIT has CRIPPLED TT Deluxe intentionally.

As a former software validation analyst, I have to warn all TT DELUXE consumers that CRIPPLING a piece of software to reap more profits is a HORRIBLE BUSINESS MODEL and a real ripoff to consumers.

We ended up having to edit each and every single stock transaction, one-at-a-time, in order to complete our return. So, I went from being VERY SATISFIED with the software (as we did not find a lot of bugs this year so far, as has been the case in the past) to COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED.

Way to go INTUIT SALES & MARKETING! Next Year, we won't need TT Business or TT Deluxe, as we will have a simpler return and we will be buying H& R Block software instead. We don't tolerate being ripped off by CRIPPLEWARE!

Then I started the program and it loaded... and loaded.... and loaded.  It took several seconds for it to finally come up to a screen where I could do something.  While startup was very slow, I was satisfied with how the program ran from that point forward.  It appears that a lot of stuff has to load to get it started but when it is done it works fine.  The only problem I had with the program was that it hung on two occassions.  Unfortunately, it hung the system so bad that I could not even use control-alt-delete to get access to shut it down.  Nothing responded.  The second time it happened I pulled my USB drive out before powering it down and the system returned control to me!  I don't know the source of the problem but after some testing I could get it to hang consistently when the SanDisk USB drive with U3 was in the computer.  It did not do it with my Toshiba without U3.  So, maybe it is a U3 thing, maybe a SanDISK thing, or maybe the combination.

The first thing to note in the program is the very intuitive user interface.  The more advanced a program is the more cluttered the interface tends to become.  However, this Suite was fairly uncluttered given it's advanced abilities.  This is not to say there is no learning curve because there is one, but it was not as steep as I had expected.

This Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.

With strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.

The other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.

The Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.

In summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.","Great program, versatile, competitively priced",1213315200,2.0,

One of the biggest complaints that I read about Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security is the cost. For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, I'll use the rebates to do the same.

With Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.

Symantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as lon as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers I've managed: usually 5-7 at one time) I'll stick with Symantec. Nevertheless, despite these pitfalls, as long as I can keep upgrading for free and my systems remain virus-free, Norton is my source for internet security.

PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.

Pros:

Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.

Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)

The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.

Cons:

The sharpen slider in the Quickfix studio works in chunks rather than in a linear fashion - 0,50 etc.  You must type in a sharpen amount in the box next to the slider and then sharpen in a linear fashion - 28,29,30,31 etc.  Serif verified this bug in Sept 08.

People ask me all the time what they should use, and I want to be able to really give them an answer. While this wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. It did catch spyware on a computer that had had antivirus protection beforehand! The main issue is how slow the software is. I didn't notice it really slowing the computer, but the scans were very slow.

The good:
1. Found spyware right away--now it was just a shopping toolbar, but it found it outside of a scan and gave me the option to take care of it right away.
2. The install was easy.
3. I found nothing in the menus that were confusing. The menus are set out out pretty well. If you have to do something (like click on a plus symbol for more info), it's usually said on the screen what you have to do.
4. Things were setup about like I would want them right out of the box. There is a game mode and it turns off after 4 hours by default.

The bad:
1. Took forever to install. I installed it on 3 computers: an xp dual-core, a vista dual-core, and a brand new windows 7 machine. It took over 45 minutes each time! I don't even begin to know why it took so long to install, and the bar fills up multiple times so there really is no way to judge if you can leave it for 10 minutes or 2 hours or what.
2. Full system scans take forever. If you leave your computes on overnight or whatever this may not be an issue, but they just take hours!
3. For some reason manual update is hidden away in the menus.

So overall, if you want your antivirus and antispyware package in one, I think you do get better antispyware protection with webroot. But because of how slow the scans are, I still suggest Norton Antivirus 2011 over this. If you need antispyware protection, the free version of malwarebytes or superantispyware works great if you're willing to run manual scans and their pay versions aren't expensive if you want scheduled scans.

So far out of 2011 software I've tried I rate them:
1 Star:
Bitdefender 2011--the file-sharing it does was a deal-breaker for me (beyond continued issues from previous version)
3 Stars:
This
Kaspersky 2011--catches stuff, but not well designed
AVG free--works ok, not the best at catching everything, tries to install it's annoying toolbar
4 Stars:
Norton Antivirus 2011--not perfect, but works, fast, well designed
Microsoft Security Essentials--my preference for free. I do think that it's lightweight protection, but for value it's great.","Not bad, but slow",1290384000,,

Unfortunately, Intuit did its usual half-hearted, half-designed job with this feature, and it's quite disappointing:
1.  You can't sync investment accounts.  The old investing.quicken.com site is very limited, not worth using.  (For example, you can't see simple consolidated views of your investments, can't run basic reports. etc.)
2.  The sync from the desktop isn't automatic, and takes a long time.  If you're used to other online products that sync to the desktop (think Dropbox & Google Drive as two very popular examples, there are many others), you will find this clunky & old-tech.  Everytime you open Quicken, it will tell you you made changes, whether you did or not, and suggest that you sync.  This should be an automated, behind the scenes process, it's not hard.
3.  The alerts are rather dumb, and they're essentially hard-coded.  You can't create your own rules, and you can't even do a lot with the built-in rules (you can just pick some parameters from a limited list).  You can't delete them all either, if you consider them dumb and pointless.  Again, not hard to do a lot better.

There are no significant improvements in reporting, or in investment analysis.  If you look at the ""What's new in 2013"" page, you see mobile, alerts, and ""more flexible budgeting"", whatever that means.

There is a tweak to how accounts show up in the nav bar, where you can put some accounts in the ""Separate"" list, which means ""show but don't include with main set of accounts"".  This is mildly useful.  There's also a feature to mark an account ""closed"", also slightly useful -- in theory.  These account still show up in the list of accounts when you're doing a transfer between investment accounts!  Clearly someone forgot what the word ""closed"" might mean.

There are two versions of Family Tree Maker. The basic one and this deluxe one. The Deluxe version includes a 3-month subscription to Ancestry.com.  For those into ongoing research, Ancestry.com is the go-to place and that is probably the reason that the trial subscription is included. But since you need to enter a credit card when setting up your Ancestry.com account, you need to remember to cancel your subscription before the expiration date or it renews automatically. This also means that the Clock starts when you first subscribe. So it is best to wait until you have time to work on this project before starting your subscription.
I found that I became busy with other more important things  after signing on and , honestly I haven't used the software a lot since I got it.

4131,3.0,False,"11 12, 2009",A1QOK9LU90ACF7,B002ABMVD6,,Centriculous,"QUICK SUMMARY:  A richly-featured, low-cost program is a great introduction into animation, but the program doesn't do much to help new users learn the craft of 2-D animation.

I selected Anime Studio Debut mostly for my kids' sake (teen and pre-teen).  Since earlier this year, they've all enjoyed using a digital camera and Windows Movie Maker to create movies, especially Lego-based movies using Lego-built characters, vehicles and movie sets.  Anime Studio seemed like something they'd enjoy using.  Okay, and I'll admit I was intrigued, too.

In reality, I think the program offers a lot of value for the money, but the implementation for a ""Debut"" program -- one where no prior knowledge of animation is required or expected -- left a lot to be desired.  Although the makers offer a very thorough tutorial to help new users explore the program, I found it to be tiresome switching back-and-forth between the PDF-based, 41-page tutorial document and the actual program.  I prefer the more elegant way of learning a new program where the program itself uses wizards to hand-hold me through the learning process.  For instance, when I learned Sony Vegas Movie Studio earlier this year, its wizards got me using a program that is certainly no less complicated than Anime Studio, and perhaps is more so.  Whereas I continue to enjoy learning how to use Vegas, my enthusiasm for Anime Studio waned quickly.

My older, pre-teen daughter and I were both frustrated at the lack of context-sensitive help or menus in Anime Studio.  I like programs that let me right-click anywhere I happen to be, and a context-sensitive menu pops up with appropriate suggestions for what I'm doing at that moment.

I will credit Anime Studio Debut as being a ""fun"" program.  My pre-teen daughter especially has enjoyed manipulating the template characters that come with this program, giving herself and her siblings a lot to laugh at.  My daughter hasn't tried using the Users' Guide to learn the program -- her learning so far has been by trial-and-error.  If the authors of this program could see my daughter interacting with their program, they could see why a PDF Users' Guide tutorial isn't what's needed for this ""Debut"" program.

I am concerned that Anime Studio crashed a LOT while we've used the program on an otherwise stable Vista laptop computer.  If you install this program, I suggest monitoring the Reliability Monitor (in Vista and Windows 7) to see how reliable your computer currently is, and again how reliable it is after you've installed and begun using Anime Studio Debut.  (To find the Reliability Monitor, click the Start button, then type ""Reliability"" in the Start Search textbox to find the monitor).

SUMMARY:  I think Anime Studio Debut offers a lot of value for the money.  I've spent nearly as much money on stupid kids' games that weren't nearly so interesting to play with.  The functionality of this program is pretty deep.  Where the program comes up short is not on the functionality it has, but in how new users must go about learning how to use those functions.  For a ""Debut"" program, there is a lot that can be done to make learning Anime Studio Debut easier to do.","An arduous learning curve, it's suitable only for the highly motivated",1257984000,47.0,

But there is something about WordPerfect that draws me to it.  Admittedly the first computer I ever had came with WordPerfect and that is really what I learned to type on, but it is more then that.

The thing I find is that while WordPerfect and the other suite programs take a little bit more time to learn and understand, once you get the basic ideas ow how things are laid out, it is so much easier to to use WordPerfect, Quattro and Presentations.

Getting to the functions you want is easier, and more intuitive.  I don't find myself hunting through menus and boxes to find the changes I want to make.

Also the help functions are soooo much better.  When you do a help search on Microsoft, you basically get a web search for whatever words you entered, with WordPerfect you get actual useful answers and tutorials on how to do what you are trying to do.

Also with WordPerfect you have the option to save files directly to PDF (A Must have nowadays if you ask me) and you have a program called paperport that lets you scan in papers and convert them, a really nice program.

While I am still forced to do much of my work on Word, I find myself more and more using WordPerfect saving and then just converting the files to MS Word or excel.  A little extra work, but still easier then using the Microsoft products.

For an application of this price I would expect a little more thorough approach. I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait?

The easy editor does step you through the process and by adding the special effects you can have a very professional looking video. I also like the slide show option. I made several slide shows of book covers. The special effects, particularly the 3D give you very interesting effects. The one caution I have is to check how the special effects crop the pictures. My book covers have portrait orientation. The balloons option crops them as though they were landscape which made the book covers unreadable. However, there are plenty of other choices.

Much as I like the software and will keep using it, there were some problems. The manual is difficult to use. It reminds me of my camera manuals which take a bit of study. This is fine for the advanced effects, but I think an instructional video for beginners would be a help. There are excellent instructional videos for the advanced effects, particularly 3D, on the website.

The other problem I had is that the software locks up a lot. You can cure it by shutting down the computer but that gets frustrating after awhile. I also had trouble consistently loading my videos into the editor. To be fair, this may be due to the way my videos are stored. My camera is the Canon HR10, which stores the video on small discs. Sometimes I could load a file perfectly. The next time, the same file wouldn't load.

So, I recommend this software if you're serious about making great looking movies. If you just want to share the family video, it may be overkill. The problems can be overcome, and the videos I made came out looking great.","Great Creativity Potential, But . . .",1325030400,,

Each upgrade is not seamless, there's always something that doesn't match during the upgrade. Then you have to spend your valuable time to changes the unmatched records from the previous version to the upgrade. Now, Intuit is forcing the owner of Quicken 2006 to upgrade to 2009 by shouting down 2006 online features. That is an unethical tactic by any measurements.

Capture cards typically came bundled with software for capturing, editing and producing video in DVD and other formats. The most common ones at the time were Pinnacle Studio and Ulead Video Studio. Ulead is now part of Corel, and is sold as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-VideoStudio/dp/B00BFYEH8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel VideoStudio</a>. That product has evolved quite a bit, and is still a good choice. I reviewed it separately as part of Corel Photo Video Suite X6. Pinnacle evolved quite a bit too, and this version is a departure from previous versions. I never used version 16, but compared to version 15 and below, this version has a substantially different interface. Its old one was centered around the paradigm of the steps mentioned above, which was common for Video Studio and also for Cyberlink Power Director. Others such as Sony took a fresh approach, and this is a fresh approach for Pinnacle.

The new interface is cleaner and more powerful. I can now edit far more video tracks, rendering is much faster, and many features have been added. Unfortunately, while video editing software seemed to be the last software product around that still came with a hard copy manual, Corel has dropped it for both this and Video Studio. I suppose if you have a Kindle, you can get by with the PDF, but you most likely want your full computer screen for running the product itself. I found the PDF manual to be lacking, and some very simple things are not documented. Thus the learning curve was greater than I expected, even though once I learned it, it was easy to use.

The newest features are useful and practical, but there is also an increasing array of features that go far beyond what I'll ever need. In past versions, I often failed to see why I need hundreds of new transitions and more title backgrounds than I'd care to look at when I'll only use a handful, but if you are looking for a special title slide or want to have effects similar to the wipes, fades, pans, folds and spins of an over the top sports broadcast, you can do that too.

The product is still well suited for getting those old Digital8 or MiniDV tapes off the shelf and putting them on line, but it's even better suited to giving you the features necessary to work with your full HD videos and render things in any popular format or burn to a Blu-ray disc. It will also handle 3D videos. It won't handle subtitles the way Cyberlink will and you'd have to rely on standard titles for that. But the interface is much cleaner than something like Cyberlink's, which tries to upsell itself.

I've found it particularly useful when multiple video cameras are used at the same event and I wish to cut from one angle to another but have a cohesive video with no breaks in action or dialog. But the same editing capabilities come in handy even with lesser quality video, and my video review shows how I was able to salvage bits and pieces of videos to come up with something better.

Whether you merely want to take a collection of video clips and put them together, adding transitions and little more, or whether you want to edit multiple videos together with fancy titles rolling credits and Blu-Ray disc menus with a different moving background for each scene selection, you can do it with this product. The PLUS version of the product doesn't have all the features of the Ultimate version, so I suggest you check the feature comparison chart. I suspect that for most users, this will work fine, especially if you save your videos on your computer or want to watch them on line. If you want to burn things to Blu-Ray disc or want support for 4K ultra HD, the Ultimate version will be better for you.",Powerful but a lot to learn,1392854400,,

The Windows 10 ""Start"" menu is more like the one in Windows 8.1 (awful) than in Windows XP (terrific). It certainly is no improvement over Windows 7, which was barely useable and very ugly.

I upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking ""all apps,"" I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the ""all apps"" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove items which made the list, but not add back the missing stuff (except by a torturous series of edits using ""regedit,"" which Microsoft has hidden to discourage use of this very dangerous utility).

Microsoft is obsessed with the ""tiles"" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the ""all apps"" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the ""all apps"" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.). Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

Edge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.

Still, only one of my programs available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered. Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.

I suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others). If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.

UPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the ""programs"" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).

UPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who ""upgraded"" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.

UPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called ""Threshold Update""which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a ""service Pack,"" or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.

UPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called ""anniversary update"" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). For the past 11 months I installed and utilized ""Classic Shell,"" a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay have rendered the Classic Shell incompatible. Thus, those who preferred the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are stuck with the latest abomination.

The folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by the user  (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded programs). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless does not allow to be selected as the default security program.  And the ""no firewall"" doomsday message continues to appear.

Since installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed grudgingly to learn to live with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC), to somehow find my way through the cluttered and sometimes vague Settings menu, to locate and adjust to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction.

The below comments reflect Windows on a 64-bit system. Some of the problems (especially search) reflect Windows, not WP.

Good features of WP: Reveal codes. Much more control over tables than in MS-Word. Foreign character sets. Mathematical formulas still better than MS-Word, but the interface has gotten steadily worse over time. WP imports and exports MS-Word documents very well, but the reverse is not true.

Bad: Too many crashes. It doesn't remember your open files when crashes or if the system forces closure. Search didn't work until the latest Service Pack. I can't save user-defined page sizes with all of the attributes, but I have to reset each time. Over the years Corel has made the macro function worse. Not competitive with MS-Word on collaboration, such as ""comments"" and tracking changes.

The program runs okay, but seems a tad on the sluggish side, even on an i7 processor  with hyper-threading and 6 gig of ram.

This seems to be Cyberlink's answer to Adobe Lightroom, which I use extensively for all my NEF (RAW) photo processing, cataloging, and publishing. In that respect, I admit a fair amount of bias towards Lightroom as it is what I'm well versed in using and used to using on a daily basis. For someone who has never used Lightroom, Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultra is a viable alternative that is well worth consideration. It is very easy to use and you can get very similar end results using either one.

The only issues with Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultra I've run across is how it specifically handles NEF files from my D300 and D610. There is slightly more noticeable color banding than what Lightroom gives, and significantly more than what Nikon's own Capture NX-D software gives. I would also give the Nikon Capture NX-D software the edge in noise reduction.

Here's the thing though, this is a 3rd party software no matter what brand camera you use. In the case of Nikon DSLR's, any of the advanced in-camera settings you use such as Active D-Lighting, lens correction profiles, long-exposure noise reduction and so-forth are completely ignored by anything but Nikon's own proprietary software. You can emulate some of those things in post-processing, but not all of them.

When it comes to the world of personal finance software, we as the general public have very limited choices.  I've used Quicken since the DOS days and moved over to Money, then back to Quicken.  My most recent version was 2006.  I booted it up and it told me it was time to upgrade because they will stop supporting online downloads come 4/30/09.  Initially I was pretty hacked off...like a lot of others here.  Then I took a deep breath, and did the math.  I think my Deluxe version cost me about $20 somewhere (eBay perhaps??) so let's do the math together shall we?  $20/3 years is about $6.67 a year.  Holy Break The Bank Batman!!  Seriously people. Quit griping.  How about you not drink 2 Starbucks all year long and put it in your ""Upgrade Quicken"" jar.

This upgrade cost me $39 direct from Quicken and took 17 minutes to download.  So let's do the math for the next 3 years, shall we? $39/3 years is a wallet busting $13 a year!!  Skip your $5 footlong at Subway 3 times all year long and you can afford the upgrade...amazing isn't it?

The upgrade was flawless on my XP machine.  Double-clicked the start-up icon and away we went.  It found my previous version and un-installed it, installed the new version and ran for the first time.  It immediately found an update so I accepted it.  After the update, the program opened to the main screen.  All of my files imported flawlessly and I was downloading my newest transactions immediately thereafter.

One of the best improvements is how you can copy digital images into the register.  In my old version, I had to save the file to my desktop and then add it through a few clicks.  Now all I have to do is right click the image, click copy, open Quicken attachment and paste from clipboard.  Genius I tell you!

The interface has a very ""gel"" ""XP"" look to it.  I'm not a real big fan of that look, but I'm not going to rate it 1 or 2 stars because of it.

I'm unaware of the history/reason my software, which was released just a few months ago, is already replaced -- too many errors? recall? Not sure.

Anyway ... this is a decent piece of software, not great. I agree with a lot of the complaints on the Amazon reviews - no product support, virus protection lacks (lots of false positives), and reports are not terribly useful. There are also some problems registering the product - they *really* want you to buy a new box every time, for every computer, which always causes problems.

My big problem with Kaspersky is a hint of greed behind the product line -- anybody who puts excessive protections on their software, at the expense of consumer convenience, has profit (not functionality or customer satisfaction) as their #1 goal. This hunch is reinforced by their lack of support - after you buy it, they seem not to care if it works for you.

But my BIGGEST problem with this, is that anti-virus protection should be free. If Kaspersky really believes in investing energy into this product, they should make it free to consumers and charge for upgrades/advances applications (such as network and business accounts). The fact is, this is already the business model for the top rated antivirus softwares.

So here's my recommendation: Get a free antivirus. The best one right now, according to reviews of the experts, is Avast. I've never had problems with Avast (except that it wants to update too often, but it only takes a few seconds). I used to run AVG, and loved it, but the new version is too clunky, lots of crashes.

*Everybody* should be running a hosts file, which Kaspersky completely ignores. The best currently is ""hostsman"" (and yes, it's free too).

And for firewall, the most recent IT studies say that the Windows XP or Vista firewall works as well as any other. It's free, and chances are you already have it. If you're running Me, 2000, or earlier, try ZoneEdit (also free).

If you're running Vista, you may want to try some of their built-in safeguards. I tried Vista for a while, and went back to XP (too clunky). But if you're on Vista, it's got some pretty decent safeguards already, and may not work well with 3rd party software.

My bottom line is, the computer is a tool which I want to *work* when I turn it on, not spend time or energy cleaning up viruses or other crap, and I should have to spend a fortune protecting it. I haven't had a problem in 4 years (and the last trojan was because my brother-in-law disabled the hosts protection on my laptop to download a game).

I have been running Norton products for many years, and they all work seamlessly, and the latest versions are even more outstanding than the previous, so I figured that this would follow suit.

Not so, at least for me.

At first, I tried to backup my basic photos, but realized that 25 gB doesn't go very far when you have a decade of photos to save.  (I have 90 gB!)  So, I decided to back up my documents...

When I ran it, it conflicted with my Norton Antivirus, and I had to call Norton Customer Support.  They walked me through a process where I had to delete one of my computer's backup through the Antivirus program to make it work.  I was told that I could just re-add it later and run a complete back up...this computer is my boyfriend's, and doesn't have a tremendous amount of data, so I didn't worry about that...

They walked me through the process of setting up the back up, but even with their help, it didn't work.  The could not figure out what the problem was, either.  It shows that I have ""increased"" backup through the Norton 360, but it's not accessible.  Crazy.

Top that off--we cannot get the deleted computer back onto the system where it backs up his data.  The Antivirus is still there, but it refuses to complete a back up.  NO clue why.  Customer Service doesn't know, either.

This is the fix:

  Question

In some cases, if Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or Snapfire Plus was installed or is currently installed on the same computer system as Paint Shop Pro Photo X2, you may experience slow performance when saving files. This behavior may be related to issues with the database files used by all of these programs.
  Answer

The following two sets of instructions may resolve this behavior and allow for proper file saving speed.

Set #1

Do the following to delete the Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Database files. The program will recreate the files upon next launch. First Close Paint Shop Pro Photo X2  if is it running.
1.  Go to Start | Run, Type %temp% and click Ok. (on Vista, click Start button, then highlight Start Search. Type %temp% and then push enter on keyboard)
2.  On the Windows Explorer Tool bar, Click the Up Folder button. The Up Folder button looks like a folder with a green arrow pointing up. If you don't see it, Click View | Go to | Up one level.  (On Vista, click Organize | Layout | Menu bar. Once displayed, go to View | Go to | Up one level).
3.  (on Vista skip to step 4) On XP, Double click on the Application data folder. NOTE: The Application Data folder is a hidden folder. Make sure you have enabled viewing of Hidden files and folders to see this folder.  We have included instructions* below for enabling this view.
4.  Double-click on the Corel folder.
5.  Delete all files and folders in the Corel folder.

* To enable viewing hidden files and folders do the following:
1. Go to Tools | Folder Options.
2. Click on View tab.
3. In the large white area marked Advanced settings, check the ""Show Hidden Files and folders"" radio button.
4. Click OK to accept this setting. You should now see the Application data folder as described above.

Set #2

Do the following to delete the old Paint Shop Pro Photo XI Database files (this is a critical step).
1.  Go to Start | Run, (on Vista, click Start button, then highlight Start Search)
2  Type %appdata% and click Ok (on Vista, push Enter key on keyboard).
3.  Double-click on the Corel folder.
4.  Delete the following files.  If you do not see all of these files, delete all of these files that you do see.
  ImageDB.db
  LastDBFilter. PspCache
  LastDBTreeSel. PspCache
  thumbnails.db
5. . Delete the Paint Shop Pro Photo folder and then close this window.

NOTE: if you receive any prompts about not being able to delete specific files (being used by another program, etc), restart the computer, then try deleting the file again.

Try running Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 again after deleting all files from above procedure. Try saving a file and note if the behavior continues.

If this corrects the behavior, then we recommend no longer running Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or Snapfire Plus on this computer system. Instead we recommend using Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 and Corel MediaOne (this is the updated version of Snapfire Plus).",PSP X2 Was Slow to Load and Save - I found the fix,1256515200,6.0,

Story-Bess and George have arranged for you to vacation with one of George's friends, in a place called Snake Horse Harbor.  She owns a whale watching tour business, and when you arrive you find out that someone has vandalized her boat.  She sets to work repairing it as you question suspects to find out that a whale recently spotted in the water might be what has driven someone to wrecking Katie's boat.

Graphics-In this game, they were a little hazy, but that works perfectly with the story, as the island you are on is foggy year round.  The characters were pretty much the same as the last game.

Sound-The music is not that upbeat.  It's rather lazy music.  Pretty much makes you think you can just take your time with this mystery.  And you can.  Although you can die, it's usually from stupidity on your part and not because someone attacked you or something.

Gameplay-The third person point-and-click hasn't changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you don't have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.

Fun-Other than that, the game's puzzles are really quite fun in spite of their difficulty.  The mystery is fun, too, as everyone has a motive to have vandalized Katie's boat.

Length-The game lasted me a few weeks, but I think playing it straight through takes about 10 hours.

And, like other video rendering software, it is slow and clunky. It has, however, solved a problem for me that makes it worth using.

I recently tried to sync videos to my iPhone and found that many videos that played fine on my iPod would not transfer to the iPhone. These included a couple of movies I had transferred using Handbrake Lite and several QuickTime videos I had downloaded as part of an online course. The QT videos had been converted to iPod format using iTunes.

After doing some research online, I found this was a common problem because of slight variations in the encoding for iPod and iPhone video. Although some videos will play on both, others (including some converted through iTunes) will not.

The files converted by Crunch in standard iPhone format play in iTunes, and sync with both the iPod and the iPhone. I was able to successfully convert files that had previously played only in iTunes and on the iPod, and get them to work on the iPhone, too.

I tried this software on both a Windows XP PC and a Mac. Both worked well. The Mac interface is a bit cleaner and might be considered easier to use, although both are simple. The main advantage the PC version has is that in addition to a bar showing the progress of the file conversion, the percentage complete is displayed. It makes it easy to estimate the time remaining in the conversion.

While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.

Being a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:

Story: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.

Graphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.

Characters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.

Puzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.

Activities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.

Ending: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.

Total (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....

The product came along just as our 10 year old grandson was beginning to create a video of his own, and wanting to edit it.  What a great opportunity, I thought, to see just how easy it is to learn and use.  To be honest, it's a bit confusing because there was no instruction manual or even a help button that was apparently available, yet it says it has over 500 features.  I'm big on documentation, and this was lacking.

We decided to turn it over to Mr. Brilliant (the 10 year old), and he dove in an intuitively figured it out and seems to have mastered it, or at least used it quite productively.  So, asking him how it was, he just said he likes it.  From him, that's a big endorsement.  And literally, we could not pull anything else out of him about it - he was too busy using it.  Even later, he was ""too busy"" to discuss it, and just reiterated that he liked the program and it worked fine for him.

So, if a 10 year old (admittedly bright beyond his years) can figure it out easier than an adult with plenty of experience using a computer, perhaps that's a great endorsement.  I only hesitate to give it a 5-star rating because I simply haven't had a need (or the time) to personally sit down with it and try to plow through all its not-so-wonderfully documented ""500 features"" to do a really thorough assessment of it.  Unfortunately, there's a time factor involved with producing Vine reviews in order to stay active in the program, so I wanted to at least get something useful up on the product.  And quite honestly, the more I thought about it, the more it did seem significant that if a 10 year old boy could sit down with it and get it up and productively running to edit his own videos, it can't be a shabby product.  It just might have been nice if Cyberlink took care of us ""old folks"" that never had computers when we were kids (I started with punch cards and Fortran IV, back before floppy discs and monitors had even been thought of).  My first ""monitor"" was a TV hooked up to my high-tech Commodore VIC-20 computer, with its BASIC language, and a cassette tape recorder for storage.  Windows?

After voice training, you will run through very useful tutorial which has a series of lessons to help you learn the intricacies of the software.
I was very impressed on how quickly it typed what you said. In my testing and along with this review my accuracy was close to 98%. This percentage is much better than I would get if I were typing.

No grammar, no lessons, etc. Just immerse the student in the language the way a baby is immersed. To be honest, I wasn't aware of that philosophy when I decided to try this out.
The technique is certainly interesting. They do a good job of showing you pictures many times and making you pronounce the word. This package comes with a mic and headphone, although I only used the mic. But when you speak back, the software tells you how well you pronounced the word. That's pretty neat. But occasionally it can get annoying if you think you've pronounced the word correctly and it still says you haven't! For each word they also have a training session so that you can practice just the pronunciation of that word.
One other 'feature' that I didn't like was that they always take you through a review when you start a new session (after having previously finished a session and then closed the software). There is a way to disable that review, but they'll always remind you about it later on and mark it as remaining to do!
In all fairness, if the goal is to learn a language, this software does a good job of that. Just don't expect to learn it quick.

I started using it when it was an independent company and gave up on it when it was acquired by Avid, who (in my opinion) practically destroyed the application and provided simply awful customer support. Like many others, I abandoned Pinnacle. It was bought by Corel and I didn't have high hopes for it.

 Much to my surprise, Corel after years of flailing is making a concerted effort to rejuvenate their acquired product lines. PaintShop Pro which was on a downhill path is really a great program in its present iteration. I skipped sever iterations of Pinnacle Studio, but when offered the opportunity to evaluate Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate, I figured why not.

 Overall I think Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate is vastly improved since my past outing with the product. But I will be sticking with Cyberlink Director.

 The feature list is on the Amazon web page, but I suggest you also look at the Pinnacle Systems website as well. Pinnacle does not offer a trial download of Pinnacle Studio 19, but the manual is available. If you're a Cyberlink Director or Adobe Premiere Elements user considering a switch, I recommend downloading and perusing the manual before purchase.

 Ultimately it comes down to a users preferences. This is probably not a program for absolute beginners, but like Cyberlink Director and Adobe Premiere Elements, it is a good place to continue after using Windows MovieMaker.

 It installs easily, interfaces are a bit cluttered  which can be said of all its competitors as well  and has some features like 4K that few people will use right now. The New Blue Effects package is nice.

 In toto, Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate is a nice serviceable video editing suite. With all the choices in the market, though, I would advise careful consideration.

It has had a good run.  It still offers something to those who want to plan long road-trips in legs, I guess, but even that use is fading with more compact GPS systems.  The mapping system does what it says it does, so that's fine....

What bothers me is how poorly the GPS hardware works.  Upon first installation, I was right next to a window, and it could not pick up any satellites at all and asked if I had a clear view of the sky -- well, no, and unless you're driving in a convertible....

Finally, as a passenger in a mini-van, I was able to obtain ""constant-intermittent"" service.  ""Huh?"" you might well ask.  Well, at least every mile, the hardware would lose satellite tracking, reacquire it, and then squelch out in its chirpy/brittle voice (even my old GPS has 6 smooth voice-choices for English) that it was re-routing and tell me again and again and again what the next turn is.  That became extremely annoying after about 3 minutes, as it was impossible to have a conversation in the vehicle, even when the next turn is in 51 miles.

I tried the male-to-famale USB cord they included to enhance the signal.  It's 28"" long (not including the connectors).  This is just long enough to be too long to rest the receiver on your lap(top) and too short to tape it to the windshield or a window, which might actually be useful.  Another loser component.

There's no traffic notification system designed into this system, which is something even my 2-year-old Garmin has.  That feature saves me a LOT of time sitting in traffic, and I can't see going backwards to this MS offering.

Also, you can't just type in a destination while driving.  You have to set up a complete ""trip"" before-hand.  This is just silly.  What you must do is create and plan a ""trip"" to your destination from some place you recently passed, while driving (disclaimer....), from whence it will re-route your ""trip,"" just to make the unit function using the same approach it did years ago before the GPS component was introduced.

I mean, as an American, I've of course encountered words like ""grande"" and ""hombre,"" but I've had almost no Spanish instruction in my life. (I did have a semester of Spanish in sixth grade, but I am 99.9 percent sure the instructor didn't actually speak Spanish, and I certainly didn't learn anything. Plus, that was two decades ago.)

I'm still working on Level 1 of this program, because I'm the mom of a very busy toddler and I also don't want to go so fast that none of what I'm learning ""sticks."" But so far, I am absolutely in love with the Rosetta Stone program.

The software (which I run on a Macbook, with absolutely no problems) is very intuitive and easy to use. There's almost no English -- just pictures and Spanish words, phrases and sentences that you quickly come to associate with one another. For example, the software says, ""Es rojo"" and you select the picture of the red object, as opposed to the blue or green or yellow one. It's almost like being in Latin America and having a very patient Spanish-speaking friend point out everything you see, again and again and again, until you learn to associate the word and the concept or object.

This method works surprisingly well for verbs and other grammatical constructions, I've found. I was really amazed at how quickly I picked up things like subject/verb agreement just from the photos and from repetition.

There is definitely a lot of repetition. Some people may find this frustrating, especially if they pick up on something very quickly and then remember it well, but it's worked well for me. I tend to grasp a concept very fast and then forget it almost immediately. But working through this program slowly seems to really be pounding Spanish into my head.

The audio companions, while probably not strictly necessary, are nice. I listen to them while I'm driving. They're mostly of the ""listen and repeat"" variety -- at least the ones I've encountered so far are -- and it helps me to try to visualize what the speaker is talking about, as a way of refreshing what I've learned.",Absolutely awesome!,1219190400,7.0,

I am Japanese American myself but am ashamed to say pretty much the only Japanese I know is being able to order from a menu, or else the more impolite words like ""bakatare"" (stupid) or ""yakamashi"" (loudmouth) or ""monku"" (complaining.. hence the ""monkuboy"" moniker, haha). While my friends went to Japanese school on Saturday mornings I resisted and my parents never forced me so I learned nothing. However, I bet everyone who went forgot how to speak or understand it anyway so we all wound up at the same place.

Regarding this program: The box is impressively heavy. It installed without a hitch using the accurate instructions, though it did take a fairly long time. The headset installed without a hitch also - I use Windows XP and it recognized the device right away and the first test with the software was successful.  It is a rather flimsy headset so you have to treat it gently.  Also, make sure you turn down the volume on your PC before using it because the voices are LOUD.

The lessons are pleasant to take and the sessions last about half an hour which seems about right to digest things. Even though most of it is intuitive as far as what to do (repeat the phrase, match something to a picture, etc.), there is a help screen present and the guidebook that comes with the set is also helpful.

I find Japanese is harder to learn than say Spanish or French because there's hardly any similarity to English (except when they borrow English words, like ""juice"" becomes ""juisah"")in the words or structure. I think the full immersion method is good because it forces you to use the language. I expect to have a basic knowledge after I finish with everything and to be able to converse on a very elementary level.

However, no matter what method you use, it has to be practiced frequently, with a native speaker.  Just like my friends who went to J-School back then, if you don't use it you lose it. At least my parents speak some Japanese and I know a few other people who do so I can bludgeon them with my efforts but for those who don't have someone to practice with, it makes it difficult.

I know someone who has the Korean version of this and he likes it very much (and he has a Korean wife so he gets a lot of free help!).

Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.

Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.

Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time. Yes I can do this with a smart folder but I would like to have option not to since I don't always want to come back to the search later.

You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.

With this program, and Kaspersky's Internet Security, I have never had any computer/Internet interface problems.  But, you pay your money and you take your chances.

UPDATE 2/6/2012

After using this program for years I let it lapse for two months.  When my computer suddenly started taking more than 2 minutes to boot-up, I renewed my subscription ($9.99).  They downloade4d an update making it version 7.09.  The problem is it still takes me more than two minutes to boot.

Furthermore, other things I thought would be fixed was the section supposed to erase Invalid Registry Items.  It is presently identifying 82 items, and it indicates that they have been removed.  But when I check through ""More"" and ""Win-Reg"" in the program, all the items are still present.  Then when I try to delete these items, two more come up that were not included in the 82.  When I think I am erasing these items the screen shows the message that a back-up of these files has been made.  Okay, so I then have either erased them or placed them into some back-up file and have rid myself of them.  None is the case: The next time I run the program all 82 are still there.  I must ask: If the program tracks and identifies Invalid Registry Items why is it that I cannot get rid of them?  In the previous version I could get rid of this stuff by going through all these steps.

When I wrote the original Review I gave the program a CLASS 5 vote.  It is still possible that using this program is doing something beneficial.  Is it actually clearing off Temp Files, Junk Files, etc from my hard drive?  I just don't know what it is really doing.  But it is clearly evident that the program is not as good as it should be.

UPDATE 10/15/2012:

I am now running last update - version 12.18.

When I run the One Click program it states that I have over thirty one Megabytes in my Internet Clutter file.  I click on confirm and it is supposed to erase all checked files that it has claimed to find.  I close and reopen the program and it is still there.  Then I click on the MORE and click on Win Clutter, check all boxes, and remove manually.  Same result.  Thirty one Megabytes of clutter is still there.  Next, I reboot my computer and run it again.  This time the same and also Windows Internet Junk File finds over one hundred and thirty Megabytes.  But I just restarted my computer after cleaning everything.  I had not been on the net.

Honestly, something is clearly wrong with this program.  I don't know what it's doing.",APPEARS TO WORK IN SOME WAYS - BUT I'M NOT SURE,1293753600,41.0,

My hopes were WAY too high for that wizard, I was really disappointed when I saw what it does and doesn't do.  You are not ""creating"" any character - you are merely playing with paper dolls by changing multiple attributes of existing generic characters.  The quality is terrible, they all look like drawings made by 6th graders who were trying to draw pictures of the most boring 1990's video game characters imaginable (really crude versions of ""Mario"" and ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" kind of stuff).  However, if you need to hit the ground running and have no talent whatsoever, then this will definitely get you moving in a hurry.

However, if you do have artistic talent, this software will have you animating your drawings faster than anything else.  The real jewel of this software is the lightning-quick bone rigging and also the physics engine that adds some realism to your work without having to agonize over many of the hassles of getting objects to move properly based on weight, gravity, etc.

Your artistic talent can be animated QUICKLY with this software, provided you are willing to accept some quality limitations as the trade-off.  Though the bone rigging is much easier in this software than Toon Boom, and it does provide smoother and more complete joints, the drawing tools, importing and vectorizing tools and options at your disposal are limited and often frustrating.  Special Effects?  Practically none, probably the biggest reason Anime Pro users drool over Toon Boom.

However, I will highly recommend this product for the absolute beginner in character animation or those who have artistic talent and need to get animating very quickly.  You'll me animating fairly quickly with very little instruction if you have talent or not.  It's great kiddieware, because kids think they have all the time int he world to explore anything and everything.  If you're an adult, however, know that animation is hard, long, and tedious work.  This software will do VERY little of the work for you (welcome to animation), but it will simplify the work you have to do probably more than any other product out there while you learn the ropes.

And for those that think Toon Boom is frame-by-frame animation only, no, it's not - it can tween just as good as any other product.  But you CAN do frame-by-frame if you want, and it does it (everything really) better than any other product.

Anime Studio is what you cut your teeth on, it's nothing more than general hobbyware.  Toon Boom is what you move to if you truly decide to get serious, and is exactly what I did.  My kid sare having a blast with Anime Studio Pro 8.

Years back, when it was owned by different companies, I switched over entirely to Microsoft Word and used WordPerfect only when a project demanded it  a situation that became never. Lately Ive also been growing fond of another word processing program called Scrivener which has many advantages for writers.

 My focus here will be n the word processing component, the eponymous WordPerfect, once the king of word processing.

 Corel has done a good job of rescuing this program,. It has lots of neat features that you will not find in Microsoft Word.

 I was particularly drawn to ePublisher, which facilitates the production of ebooks in MOBI and EPUB formats. This is a template rather than an integrated part of WordPerfect and for basic publishing tasks is easy-to-use and works well.

 WordPerfect also has substantial PDF editing and creation tools, which are very impressive.

 The integral Help file is excellent. The User Interface is streamlined and cleaner in some ways than Words.

 File format compatibility isn't very important to most these days, but WordPerfect can deal with more than 60 file formats in one way or another.

It would have been nice if they had added some new title, transition or video effects, but they are the same ones that have been there since x4 I believe.

I needed a place to keep templates for character development and other aspects of the story.

I only recently discovered how to make comments on my text!  The point here is that you need to keep at it.  Do the tutorial, poke around in it and see what it does.

Right now, though, it is the faster and most fabulous Windows OS I have ever used, except it doesn't have Word for free like the Vista on my Dell laptop.

Okay, I'm reviewing the free download from Microsoft, which anyone can get for any device with home versions of Windows 7 or 8 on it.  Months ago, I reserved Windows 10 for my Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 7.  After reserving it, my Toshiba started having problems, especially on start up.  It could take me sometimes 10 minutes to get online! Firefox froze constantly, Chrome was only slightly better, and IE would hardly ever work at all.  I suspected the problems were due to Windows 10 either being downloaded or tested out on my laptop in the background. At one point, I even stopped the automatic Windows Updates so I could see what was being installed.  Unfortunately, I forgot I stopped automatically updating and when I went to Windows Updates this week, saw that I had countless critical updates.  I also had only one choice to choose--Install Windows 10.  They didn't even send me a notice it was my time to do so, after I had been waiting for the notice for months.

Well, I hit the install button, left my laptop plugged in and went about my day.  When I came home and checked the download in the late afternoon, it said it had failed.  The error code suggested the laptop lost connection to the internet.  Thus, I started again and the download amount immediately went to 49% . . . but then it went down to 0%.  I then decided to try to do individual installation of all the critical updates for Windows 7, pushed cancel, and discovered I no longer could view the individual updates.  My only choice was to choose installing Windows 10 again, which I did, and my download amount immediately became 90%.  It then quickly went to 100%, the installation started and finished in no time, and I, at long last, had Windows 10.

It started off with some settings questions that seemed like nothing but spying to me, so I chose ""off"" for all of them.  That didn't seem to slow down Windows 10 at all or mess it up or whatever.  Now, when I go online, I'm online in usually 60 seconds or so.  Firefox, Chrome and Windows Edge, which replaced IE, are all working well.  I can go from one browser to another with no problems.

But I have been using Norton Antivirus for several years, and McAfee's online ratings aren't much better, so -- I purchased this product online.  There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted (Norton Internet Security Professional) and also the standard (non-Pro) version I didn't want.  The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the ""download warranty"" that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.  I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I didn't want and went to the next page, where I expected to see only what I wanted, and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final.  But no, I was charged for all four products, including the two that aren't products at all.
The run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL, and apparently the download warranties CAN'T be refunded.  I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?  If so, what about all that support they're promising, if they go down?
Next issue: within a few minutes of installing the software, Norton blocked and reported an attempted access from the Internet, called ""Default Block NetBus Trojan Horse"".  Great, that's what I was hoping to prevent.  BUT: what was that all about?  How do I know who was doing it and who do I tell, in order to get somebody put in jail?

PhotoDirector is a cool, easy-to-use photo editing program that has the tools you need to fix those bad digital pics.

I am a point and shoot digicam user. I've played around a little with other photo editing software, but I am far from an experienced user. If you have never used this kind of software before, you will need to spend some time reading the manual and playing around with the different tools in this program. It is actually pretty intuitive, but if you have never ever done any photo editing, it may all look confusing to you. Don't worry - once you get the hang of it you will be thrilled with the results.

Besides basic photo editing like cropping, sharpening, noise reduction, lighting adjustment and saturation adjustment, you will find a host of fun adjustment pre-sets that automatically convert your photo into a B&W, a sepia-tone, apply a ""Barbara Walters"" softening filter, will ""posterize"" your photo, and all sorts of wonderful adjustments.

You can also remove unintended objects (or offending ex-husbands) quickly and easily while still preserving your photo.

My favorite feature is the People Beautifier. It has a Tooth Brush which lets you easily whiten teeth in a photo, an Eye Blinger which whitens and brightens eyes and enhances eyelashes and eyebrows, a Skin Smoother and Wrinkle Remover, and a Body Shaper which lets you instantly lose weight and redistribute what's left! Seriously, these tools all work beautifully but are subtle enough that you won't end up looking like a caricature.

My only complaint is, like with lots of powerful programs these days, the documentation leaves something to be desired. There is a basic users manual included in the box and it will certainly get you started. But the many nuances of this program are not covered. Still, if you spend some time playing around with PhotoDirector, you'll discover just how many things you can do with it and how easy it is to use.

Specifically, I wanted it to allow me to do two things: (1) convert AVCHD files directly, even without having my camcorder plugged in; (2) archive the AVCHD files from a camcorder harddrive or SD card onto a dvd, from which the files can be pulled as if they were on the original camcorder.  Without this, I would need to convert my files in Final Cut Express as I take them off of the camcorder.  With it, I can just drag the .mts files onto an external hard drive and only convert them as I need them.

It converts the video just fine, but the audio is out-of-sync with the video, lagging behind by a few frames to begin with and getting progressively worse for long clips.  I didn't notice this at first because most of my video was of nature and so I didn't notice that lips didn't match voices.  Then I did some interviews and was very disappointed.  I've tried everything I could think of to fix the problem, including an uninstall and a reinstall.  No dice.  (But see UPDATE below).

So I emailed customer service - you CAN call them but a 15 minute call costs [...] bucks, even if they don't resolve the issue for you!  No thanks.  So I emailed them, stated my problem clearly, that I was working on a Mac and they responded with some fix for a different Windows video player that Roxio sells, for a problem completely unrelated to mine.  So I emailed them back, and they told me to uninstall and reinstall and then upgrade (once again).  A couple of hours later, having done that, I tried to convert a file and the same problem recurred.  So I emailed them again, and in the email mentioned that I'm on Snow Leopard and they pointed me to a link that mentioned there is currently a problem with their TIVO support for Snow Leopard.  In fact, I'd already seen that link when I was researching the problem (and also seen that I'm not alone in having this problem and that others report it on different Mac operating systems as well).  As far as I can tell, the ""customer care"" associates I've been corresponding with are really just a computerized search engine that picks a few random words from the query and sends back a ""solution""  that can be associated with that query.  I'd do better with Google than with Roxio's ""customer care.""  (One thing I noticed is that for the last couple of years, as far back as Toast 9, they've been telling other people with the same problem that it is a ""known issue"" that they are working on a solution for.  How can they put out a new version of a problem with ""known issues"" that they haven't yet resolved?

UPDATE (12/18/09): Now, several months and a few upgrades later, Toast is finally working like it's supposed to.  With version 10.5 the audio no longer lags behind the video.  I had purchased Voltaic HD online to fix the problem, and it did fix it, but unfortunately Voltaic is a lot slower than Toast and I don't see a major difference in quality.  Now with version 10.0.5, things seem to be working fine, and it is very fast.

It helps me not to have to go through a folder with hundreds of pictures/videos over and over again. I love this feature! (And they needed to add it since Adobe Elements 13 added it)
-Even more effects--like I didn't waste enough time already over effecting my home videos... Thankfully there's now a favorite section so you can put your favorite effects where you can easily get to them.
-Multicam support--If you have a party or wedding or wherever you might have more than one people videoing, it's pretty cool to be able to jump around the cams. If you have audio for your videos, it even tries to line them up automatically!
-Support for more file types and better 4k support.

When you open it up, it looks very similar to 17 or 18. It's an evolution and refinement with more features. It's good to know they didn't change everything! It's run pretty smoothly so far, but I have a pretty powerful computer. I don't have anything higher than 1080p to play with, but I've not had issues. I do suggest you use the system requirements as a very minimum requirement. I wouldn't try running this on anything less than an i5 with 8GB of ram and would prefer to have an actual video card in there too--and that may still give you a lot of waiting when crunching higher res video. I wish Pinnacle would give you a suggested computer setup for different levels of performance. I'm running it on an XEON 1650v3 with an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 and 16GB of ram. That's basically the equivalent of a high end i7 and a GTX 750. You're going to have a completely different experience running this on your $400 laptop than a performance machine. Video editing takes a lot more processing than picture editing.

But I was able to trim, split, combine single and multiple HD videos with no issues. I could have saved in many formats and DVD. It does bluray with an additional purchase. But, disk based media is practically dead. I'm just glad it lets me save it as a mp4. It will also export to Facebook, Youtube, and Vimeo.

My understanding is that Pinnacle provides little if any support. And I think that's the main disadvantage over Adobe Premier Elements. I can google all sorts of issues with Adobe Premier Elements and find all kind of help. It may be slow support with a strong accent, but I can call Adobe. Pinnacle Studio does have tutorial videos on their site and on Youtube. It looks like more videos for 19 are coming and most of the 18 videos do apply. There is a knowledge base in the support section and the ability to email support (free for 15 days from purchase...). If it works great, you're good. If it doesn't work for you or you have problems with the program--good luck...

But for me it's been working great. It hasn't crashed once. The way it works makes sense to me. If you're still deciding, go to youtube and search for ""Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate - Basic Editing Beginners Tutorial"". That will give you an idea of how the program works. I think Premier Elements is a little bit easier for a beginner, but I think it's easier to do some more complicated things with Pinnacle Studio.",Good evolution of Pinnicle Studio.

I love the casting feature which I successfully used with a Roku 3. This software is great for viewing and casting video, still photos and playing music files. I think it fills a niche for those who miss Windows Media Center and are looking for a solid media player with perks.

Older video looks better using the PowerDVD 16 Ultra software, and everything sounds great! I love that it's capable of handling 4K, enhancing video of all types and casting to larger screens too. The integration of YouTube and Vimeo content was a sweet touch. Would love to see future versions include links to add Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services to the mix too.

I was able to install it on Windows 7, 8.1 and Windows 10 PCs without a problem and the more I use it the more I like it.

I also like that it comes with a $60 bonus software package with PhotoDirector 7 Deluxe, a digital copy of PowerDVD 16 Ultra, and 30GB of Cyberlink Cloud storage for 1 year. NOTE:  PhotoDirector software has its own unique serial number, but instructions to download and install it are inside the box.

-------------------------------------------------

What I like about this software...

+ You can install it on multiple Windows PCs. Despite looking for the answer on the Cyberlink website, I've not found that there is a limited number of installs you can make with the included PC disc. There's also a link to download and install the software with the code on your PC disc if you have a laptop without a disc drive. I've put it on (1) Windows 7 and (2) Windows 10 PCs without issue.

+ You can extract audio from video and save it to a file. So if you want a sound bite, or a song from a movie, you can do it!

+ The PowerDVD Remote by Cyberlink for iOS (iPhone) and iPod Touch) works well and the app is free.

+ Installation was easy and completed within about 1 minute. The prompt to view tutorials was very helpful as in watching them you are introduced to the software's features and how to get started.

+ 30 GB FREE storage on the Cyberlink cloud. (Not sure for how long though?)

+ Compatible with Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.

+ Great DVD player on a PC! TrueTheater enhancement does make a positive difference. Both audio and video are better than expected.

+ Auto memory for where you left off in a movie or a slideshow is a wonderful feature.

+ Comprehensive video and audio format support!

+ It's easy to navigate whether in PC or TV mode.

+ 4K and high frame rate video playback is supported, meaning you don't need extra software for playback.

+ Casting to Roku, Chromecast and Apple TV devices - my favorite feature! If you have stuff you want to share, bring your laptop with PowerDVD 16 Ultra on it and a Chromecast device to your location and you're set.

----------------------------------------

What I wish was better...

-/+ The price is on the high side for not also supporting installation on Mac computers.

-/+ During installation you are given the option to have this program associated with opening video, photos and music by default. Be sure to uncheck the boxes if you don't want the program to take over these functions automatically.

-/+ PC mode and TV mode... why two modes that essentially do the same thing? The menus are slightly different and I'm guessing it has something to do with the integration of the remote app.

-/+ With Windows Media Player and a TV tuner in my PC I was able to use my hard drive as a DVR. I don't see how to do this with this software, but perhaps it's there and I just don't see it? There's a lot to learn about this software.

----------------------------------------

While I use VLC to view videos and Windows Photo Viewer or Photoshop Elements to view photos, and I rarely use anything but iTunes for my music library - this software will change that on my Windows 10 laptop PCs. It's just easier to use, and has a prettier interface with it all right there. The addition of the 'casting' feature is what really makes it a winner for me as I'm sure I'll use it a lot.

If you mourned the loss of the Windows Media Player with the update from Windows 7 to 8, 8.1 and 10, this is worth checking out. There is a FREE trial on the Cyberlink site, so you can play with it before you buy it.",Media management with cool perks,1463875200,2.0,

This product got me started and greatly reduced legal fees.  I knew I wanted a living trust and wanted a lawyer involved but dreaded the expense.  By using this product to become informed about all the questions and forms, I was able to prepare my will and a framework for the trust which I can now take to a lawyer for verification and filing for a fraction of the cost of going in cold. The product produces the appropriate documents which you can have notarized and will serve the legal need, but for something this important I wanted to spare my kids any issues by having everything reviewed and officially verified.

We used a Living Trust for my mother which worked really well for her and then for us following her death which kept the disposition of her effects, sale of her house, etc., as painless as possible in a state where the estate laws are onerous. It encouraged me to do the same for my kids.

I'd been avoiding the process until I bought this product which got me started.  In the box is the software CD and a book, but it is not an instruction manual.  It is 'The Legal Answer Book for Families' and includes the topics: adoption, child custody, domestic partnerships, teenagers, elder care, marriage, name change, tax breaks and divorce with free updates on the Nolo website.  The product user manual is a pdf file included in the software so an internet connection is not required to access it.

The product installed easily on my Win7 PC and offered a free download of updates but upon reading the items included in the update, I didn't bother as they didn't apply to me.  The software starts with a short movie which I found useful and informative.  It is laid out well and very easy to use. There are five sections which can be tackled separately.  They are: Will, Health Care Directive, Durable Power of Attorney for Finances, Final Arrangements and Information for Caregivers and Survivors.  The documents created are listed under each topic as you create them and you can easily return to any one to review or change it.

There is plenty of help along the way, including a checklist of items to gather before starting each section.  This is precisely why I wanted to use such a product before involving a lawyer.  Having all this thought out in advance and recorded is well worth the cost of the software.

It is generally not hard to install, though some systems may have programs installed that interfere, so it's best to close out everything else that is running before starting the installation. If you have X5 and are satisfied then there's not much reason to upgrade - Winzip, the program that began as popular shareware, is an addition to X6 that most people won't really need. WordPerfect Office is compatible with MS Office/Word formats so you can exchange files between the two, and there is similar functionality. Each suite has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the user. WordPerfect is more affordable since it doesn't have the market dominance that MS Office has. For those really on a tight budget there is the OpenOffice program that can be obtained for free online from Sun MicroSystems. That one handles the basics well but lacks a lot of extra features and options that you can get in the commercial Office suites. For those who are in need of a suite that includes resources for word processing, presentations, spreadsheets, file management, Internet integration, and more, I would recommend considering WP Office X6 - if you have a recent PC model. If your PC is pretty old it might not handle the latest software so well, so you should check the recommended system specs before getting the software.

Looking back over my use of  MS Windows products for nearly 30 years, I would never have rated any release higher than ""3."" This is because Microsoft's corporate culture is marketing-driven, not quality-driven. Its products are pushed out the door much too quickly, and many of the security vulnerabilities, bugs, and undesirable ""features"" are never fixed. What's more--customers get whiplash from Microsoft's constantly ripping up the user interfaces to which customers have become accustomed, and replacing them with something far different and non-intuitive.  This costs customers time and frustration, and businesses money in lost productivity. Add to those problems the registry--a cumbersome, unreliable cornerstone of this system, and frustration and loss of productivity are guaranteed. From my perspective, the only reason for using Windows is that its software is ubiquitous--if you want to do application x and want to share it with user y, you tend to be in the Windows trap.

Although Windows 8 is better than some (such as the infamous Vista), it still has bugs. Such as the one that prevents some laptops from completely shutting down and powering off. Even the implementation of several ""fixes""--some by Microsoft, some by others--failed to fix this problem on a Lenovo laptop. Restarts and shutdowns will reach a point where the machine is doing nothing for an extended period, and yet it is still powered on. You must manually power it off, then on again.

 On a recent trip, I was navigating. In a car moving at expressway speeds, the results in the search box were impossible to read because the type is so small. The address I was looking for is a house that was built in 1993. Neither it nor the surrounding community are to be found on the these maps.

 In my own area, within a six block radius, both MapPoint 2009 and Streets & Trips 2009 list four restaurants that closed three or more years ago. Another restaurant, which has been located at its current location for at least ten years, is still shown at its former location a couple of miles away.

 Such inaccuracies are unacceptable.

 For route planning, I would strongly suggest using Google Maps as your primary source or at least to check on the accuracy (or lack thereof) of the Microsoft products.

 Data mapping capability, on the other hand, is excellent. You can use "". . . an address, ZIP Code or postal code, census tract, city, metropolitan statistical area (MSA), state or province, or country. You can aggregate data by importing or linking data at one level (for example, ZIP Code) and displaying at a higher level (for example, State). Additionally, you can associate data to territories that have been defined on the map.""

 Importing is a relatively smooth process and you can use Excel, Access, Outlook contacts or any of several text formats.

 You can create territories from data or manually. Pushpin styles are limited, compared to the last version, but you can add your own.

 Once the data is mapped, you can massage it in a variety of ways, including creating routes between multiple pushpins.

 Overall, I think both Microsoft mapping products have taken a step backwards from the most recent versions. Neither MapPoint 2009 nor Streets & Trips 2009 have any features compelling enough to make the upgrade and the maps appear to be the same. I'd hold off for the next version or consider competitive products. By all means, try out the Microsoft evaluation version before you purchase this product. Make sure it works for you and that the maps are accurate enough for your needs.

Nero 2014 packs a lot of products into this single collection.  This can make it difficult to find the functionality that you want.  For example I figured I'd try recoding a CD to MP3s to play on my portable player, you'd think ""Nero Recode"" would do this task.  No, it doesn't, ""Recode"" says it doesn't recognize any of the files on the CD.  I managed to find under Nero Express a tab for the ""extended area"" where I found ""Save Audio Tracks"" which does this process.  There is a long hesitation as it loads the dialog box, which I assume is it going out and querying the Internet for the track name data (no option to skip this check).

Not only is this an impressive, powerful suite of graphics design tools, Corel doesn't throw you under the bus as soon as you install the software.  If you're like me and don't have a single artistic bone in your body (I can't draw a straight line with a ruler), you would expect a fancy-pants software package like this to leave you dumbfounded from the start, with no clue on how to get started.  Much to their credit, Corel throws you lifelines as soon as you jump in the pool and makes a diverse set of rescue resources near at hand for you at all times.  I'm not saying you'll be a graphics design guru after a couple of hours - this is a really advanced,  powerful set of programs here - but you would have a hard time finding a piece of software with more impressive built-in support.  The first of several excellent video tutorials is available on the Welcome screen, and you can choose to have a built-in docket of usage tips available for every function you choose.  Users of previous versions of the software will have no problem recognizing the changes this upgrade brings with it, as you can choose to have every single change and addition from your previous version highlighted on the screen.  That doesn't sound like much, but it is a big help.  You also have What's New and Learning Tools readily available to you from the Welcome screen as well as from inside each of the featured programs.  Of course, you also have a complete help file available but you won't need to resort to using that very often.

As I'm sure you can tell by the price, you don't buy this program if you just want to take the redeye out of your vacation photos or create a cute little Christmas card to send to friends.  You can certainly do those things with this, but Corel Photo-Paint X4, impressive as it is, is overshadowed by the primary CorelDRAW application.  (If all you want is a powerful photo editor, I would still recommend Fireworks - my favorite - or Photoshop.)  I would like to have seen a few more built-in templates included, but CorelDRAW actually succeeds in making graphics design possible for even artistically inept folks like me.  This is one powerful program which actual graphics professionals should take to like fish to water.  Professionals may be the primary target audience for this software package, but Corel does a great job of making these powerful tools available and actually useable by anyone.

I also have to mention several additional software applications and features included in this suite deal.  Corel PowerTRACE X4 is of enormous help in turning traced bitmaps into images you can convert into editable vector images.  Corel CAPTURE X4, as you might guess, is a powerful screen capture utility.  The Bitstream Font Navigator is a comprehensive font manager that even helps you identity scanned fonts from an outside source.  You even get a Duplexing Wizard to aid you in optimizing the appearance of your document when printing two-sided copies.  Vista users will also welcome the integration of this software package with the Vista operating system, as the search and preview options by themselves should be of great convenience to them.

What about file formats and the age-old question of compatibility?  After all, the odds are that some if not many of your associates are working with different file formats in non-Corel software.  Well, Corel has worked to make CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 software as compatible as possible with other users and systems.  In this release, the list of additional new formats includes Word and Publisher 2007, AutoCAD DXF and AutoCAD DWG, and Adobe CS3.

I could go on writing paragraph after paragraph about this product, but I could never begin to describe all of its many impressive features.  Is it the best graphics design software on the market?  I don't know, as I have no experience using any comparable graphics design programs.  Even if I had, I don't think anyone short of a professional graphics designer would be able to judge the comparative pros and cons.  What I do know is that anyone who is serious about graphics design in any of its various facets would do well to give CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 a long and serious look.",An unprecedented combination of graphics design power and usability,1227657600,3.0,

--------------------
While I am still behind the general approach to this software, unfortunately, after making it quite a ways into the software, I have decided that the technical implementation--particularly around voice recognition--is so unbelievably poor as to make the software unusable.

Here are the big problems.

1. The voice recognition component is worthless.  At times even the most simple word (I can certainly pronounce ""drei"" in German) fails to recognize the word.  For fun--and to prove the point--go into the mode where you can repeat the word as often as you want and get an analysis of what you did right or wrong.  You can repeat a single, simple syllable over and over and watch the analysis be completely different every time.  The important part to notice is that it does not register a ""fail"" (as in, ""you said it wrong""); it simply does not take input from the microphone.  It registers an ""I did not hear you"" sound, and no amount of begging will convince it you are speaking.  At other times, I have discovered that the only way to get something ""right"" is to intentionally pronounce something wrongly--for example, anything like ""Ich"", ""Spreche"", etc. with a ""ch"" has a far better chance of success if pronounced as an English ""sh"" (as in ""she"", ""shy"") rather than the correct sound.

2. The Support is HORRIBLE.  When I contacted them to discuss the problemsabove, they told me (rather sarcastically) that I was simply not saying the phrase correctly.  This was ironic from ""Bob"", who clearly someone in need of ""Rosetta Stone for Residents of Bangalore"".  To illustrate that I am not completely incapable of repeating a very basic sound, I recorded the voice of the Rosetta Stone native speaker and played it back to the program.  It was wrong over 80% of the time.  When I pointed this out, the support organization then suggested that it was perhaps a problem with the microphone, and transferred me to a different department to give me the privilege of buying another microphone from them (gee, thanks... $600 for this software and you want me to buy another microphone because by your own admission the microphone you included is broken?  that seems ummm... really...  reasonable).

3. Rather than purchase the oh-so-cheap microphone, I elected to purchase a very nice microphone from SoundBlaster.  This product works great--for every piece of software except Rosetta Stone, which continues to be unable to understand even the most basic phrases.  I then tried a rather nice Logitech--same results--great precision everywhere else and nothing in Rosetta Stone.

4. The most frustrating part of this is that some days, Rosetta Stone will work just fine.  I can go through lesson after lesson with perfect scores; then suddenly it simply decides to fail.  Occasionally a reboot will help, but generally just for a few minutes, then it is back to being horrible.

Overall, it is a shame that a piece of software that is otherwise quite a good way to introduce you to a new language is (a) so insanely bad in a critical product area, and (b) the company refuses to recognize the deficiency.  This software is never going to make anyone a fluent speaker--even with these problems fixed--but if I knew I were being dropped into German in three months, it would certainly be something I believe would prepare me to get by and build the base I needed for eventual fluency after living there for a few years.

I think that the bottom line is that if you are willing to skip all the speaking lessons, you might really enjoy and get value from this software, but I strongly suggest that you save yourself the frustration of dealing with the random God of Speech (Dis-)Recognition

------------END UPDATED REVIEW--------------

Rosetta Stone Version 3 is an excellent way to introduce someone to a new language.

SETUP
Reasonably easy, but I would strongly recommend an Internet connection during installation to get all the features unlocked.  I did the installation on an airplane, and found out that I was missing a few things.  This is easily remedied later.

COURSE CONTENT
Overall, the course content is very good, using only the German language--there is no use of English at all, except for menu options and such.  This is not, therefore, a course that relies at all on ""translation"".  Rather, the course uses images and audio to acquaint the user with key words and phrases, then re-enforces them by using them in different orders, combining them in different ways, etc. until the use becomes natural.

This is generally quite effective, but in some areas falls short.  For example, the intricacies of German articles (is it ""Der"", ""Das"", ""Die""?) can be a little tricky to pick up in this way--it would be nice to have at least some explanation of how these are used in a general sense, explaing how they are used with respect to gender and plurality.

An unfortunate feature is that the images appear to be very generic, as opposed to specifically related to the German culture.  I assume that this allows Rosetta to recycle these images for other languages, but it diminishes the quality of the immersion program, and is my reason for giving this product only four stars.  To truly learn a language, one must understand its culture as well, and having images that match that culture would greatly enhance the experience.

CONCLUSION
Other than the specific issues mentioned previously, this is an excellent product and I would recommend it over any other language training products I have encountered.",UPDATED:  Very good way to learn a language; shame about the implementation.,1229644800,4.0,

When I decided to purchase another NAS device (extra speed, more storage), I could not find a better product than this QNAP.  You can find CHEAPER devices from synology, or thecus, but I feel this device is one of the best.

It IS a lot of money, and you could build a computer for less money, but at full load this device uses much less energy than a computer, is quieter, and QNAP is always updating the firmware with new features.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: A shot back into time as we are on the cusp of the Great Depression [1930] in Nancy Drew's latest adventure mystery.  What can we learn from this era? What timeless things are ours to explore in the town of Titusville [in the midwest]?  I found fascination about this time warp, but actually learned nothing unique as I used the tools and ideals brought out from that decade.

INITIAL SCORE: 85

CHARACTERS:

Emily Crandall:  Nancy is out to learn from a friend of a friend what is upsetting this teenager and soon is on a two-part mystery that involves theft of family jewelry and a possible forgery of an estate will.  Emily was definitely distraught as she dealt with insecurities of being financially defunct, her mother passing away a month prior, her odd new guardian, and strange things happening to her [moving framed pictures and voices in her room].  I never got the sense she was insane; just tense. Emily did lose a bit of control at the end when she verbally attacked Nancy; I didn't take too much offense in that, although I probably should have.

Jane Willoughby: This is Emily's mother's best friend and she got under my skin right from the start.  Her Minnesota voice was out of place I felt and the strange lingo of ""What's cooking?"" irritated me to the fact that I avoided her if I could.

Richard Topham: Spitting image of John O'Hurley http://images.playbill.com/photo/o/h/ohurleycue200.jpg  and the resident ESP paranormal psychic that continues to practice on the grounds.  He was close colleagues with Josiah Crowley, the eccentric rich man who owned the Lilac Inn and is now the direct benefactor of the will that is now being contested.  I thought it a little arrogant to have him infer I needed to pass a test in order to converse with him, but I also found it fascinating since I aced it!

Jim Archer: This banker was my #1 suspect, because there was something about his financial dealings he won't making clear to me and he seemed friendly in a bizarre way.

Carson Drew/Bess:  This was the most grown up I have ever heard from Nancy's dad as compared to the later versions where he sounds less gruff and slightly younger in his views. Bess was the same delight as always.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
Totally different from any of the other ND adventures which is quite obvious. I didn't say it was an excellent score necessarily, but I give HER points for bringing out the era's style.  Graphics were decent, though learned nothing new about the era except perhaps the roadster and black/white photos of the early 20th century after the first World war.  Sound effects and detail of the ladder being sprung in the barn were fantastic.  The businesses and residents of Titusville were hugely entertaining as you delivered telegrams in the adventure. I loved Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farms, haha

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 86

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The golf game was strangely not as fun as I would have imaged, although I loved the golfball color challenge. Also not as enjoyable as I thought was the conversation cue ESP test. It took me a long time to integrate the sentences Richard spoke with the traditional card symbols. The Hobo puzzle was easy and okay. I like the test in the parlor involving the slider Shakespeare characters.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 86

ADVENTURE ENDING: I wasn't totally compelled with the plotline, but I wouldn't necessarily say I was bored neither. Thank God that the telegrams weren't a required evil the entire time as that would have made the game extremely tedious.

CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 87

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me three days [9 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 75

My Strong Points: The games were completed at a steady pace and I rarely needed help from the walkthrough although I had trouble finding out where to continue the adventure after being derailed mentally sometimes.

My Weak Points: I did not guess the culprit!!!  I didn't think I was that off-base, but I WAS so I have to give HER a bit of credit for stumping me [something they hadn't done in the last seven adventures thus far].

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: Cracking the Top Ten says a lot for a Franchise that is pushing to get its first A level type game, but at least we know that HER is trying to stretch its boundaries. Good Job and keep going!

2264,4.0,False,"05 8, 2008",A1VLVWTLV3LVHR,B00123WD40,,Tim Robertson,"Bento was released by the makers of FileMaker Pro with a very specific purpose. Interestingly, Bento was the name given to a layer in Apple's visionary OpenDoc architecture launched with System 7.5 in the mid 1990s.

Bento is a personal (as opposed to ""enterprise"" or networked) database that's meant to be as easy to use as the Mac itself. It has a carefully-identified set of features. These run parallel to those of iWork's Pages and Numbers. It could have been called i(Data)Base to aim at a comparable niche in the market. Bento complements Pages and Numbers nicely. The criticisms that some users (and reviewers) leveled at Bento, that it lacked, for example, scripting, Automator and network support, miss the point. It was never intended for those sorts of uses - or those types of users; look at FileMaker Pro for such extended power.

Bento was specifically designed and released without such features in order to concentrate on the less-experienced consumer and SOHO user. Some missing areas of functionality might be useful to the non-specialist user. On the whole, though, the balance between price and feature set, not to mention features, means that Bento can be safely recommended.

Bento is designed to accomplish everyday tasks using a pleasing and straightforward template-based interface The very fact that it is simple, has only one window, and just the right number and design of a few uncluttered menus adds to its accessibility and effectiveness as a flexible and powerful tool.

It only takes a quick glance at the lively, comprehensive and very well supported and moderated Bento forum to see how easy it is to achieve sophisticated date calculations and many-to-many implementation; Bento's apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Bento Users is another useful site. The documentation that comes with the product is excellent.

Everyday
FileMaker has compiled a list of some of the more likely projects that Bento can handle. These include:

* what FileMaker, Inc. calls ""virtually unlimited"" contact details
* coordinating events, parties, and fundraisers
* tracking projects, assignments, and deadlines
* prioritizing tasks; Bento has been used successfully in a Getting Things Done task management context
* inventories, donations, and items for sale
* track hours worked, payments due, invoicing
* rate service providers and sellers
* libraries for music, movies, and media
* store files and photos related to projects and events

and, rather cryptically, since this ought to be part of any good data model:

* connect related information together to see more details.

There are ample standalone products to achieve many of these tasks - Project Managers like OmniPlan and task management - the same company's OmniFocus. Bruji's outstanding BookPedia and CDPedia. There are dedicated time management and billing/invoice suites like TimeNet Pro - though none without some flaw; and iPhoto, Address Book and iCal themselves, with the last two of which Bento integrates closely.

It is what it is
So the criteria for MyMac's evaluation must not be, What's missing from Bento? Rather, how well does this reasonably-priced and robust Leopard-only product do what it's been designed to do?

First and foremost, then, is a courageous - and largely successful - attempt to make database design and management accessible to those who are not specialists or experts in such software, but who still have demanding needs such as some of those just mentioned.

Bento's main window consists of three panes:

The leftmost pane is the Source List of all your data Libraries. Libraries are Bento's top organizational level - like iPhoto 7's ""Events."" One Bento Library is for one set of data or project. Under these in the Source List are Bento's Collections; these are like iTunes' Playlists - subsets of the data in the Libraries. Then Smart Collections behave just as you would expect: they're Views updated in real time and as your filter criteria - or the records that matches them - change. You might, for example, want to create a Smart Collection of all unpaid invoices - as they get paid, they disappear; or of all unsold artifacts in a craft store - as they are sold, they disappear.

The records area is in the middle and is the largest pane. Data can be presented as a form (an individual record) or table of as many records as will fit into the space. You can have more than one form for any Library (each may display different fields - in different orders). This is emphasis on the user experience again; it drives the way you work. Each view is satisfactorily editable - columns can be dragged horizontally for display; you can chose which you will view too. The principles, of course, are analogous to those in FileMaker's ""Align"" routines and fit well with the sophisticated controls that Bento offers.

The Associated fields list for each Library is on the right. Fields are created here and dragged and dropped onto the Records area. There are only three attributes for each. There is also control over how many of these three panes will appear - you can focus on what you're doing.

This is a familiar interface; and it preserves the metaphors for data handling on which Bento rests. Similarly, searching, sorting, and summaries are all swift and intuitive. Searching can be very sophisticated and saved as a Smart Collection.

Note, though, that this means that there's no concept of separate datastores in Bento. All the data which you use Bento to maintain is managed in one place. You can still share Libraries with other users. Yet if you organize your data according to ""domains"" within your life (household, work, hobbies, friends, you may find it a disadvantage to access it all in and from one place by launching the Bento application itself as opposed to separately-located data files. On the other hand, this is very much in keeping with current Mac practice: it is the way that iCal, iPhoto, iTunes, iWeb (though not Pages or Numbers) all work. More evidence of the perceived target audience; for them it is assumed the task in hand is more important than file names, file management.

Data Types
Given these intentional restrictions, the substantial variety of data types (nineteen of them) which Bento handles is impressive: basic text, numbers, dates, drop-downs, Booleans, graphics, sounds, movies, ratings, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses and more. There's also a FileMaker-like calculation field which can, for example, concatenate text and multiple fields values as well as perform simple mathematical operations. Inevitably there will be some function missing for someone, but on the whole it's comprehensive - and very easy to use.

Templates
For all its transparency, Bento is not a glorified Wizard. Fields can be controlled - use drag and drop. Fields are rearranged and resized with the mouse - usual Mac style. Some positioning and alignment of text is possible using a toolbar - though probably less than most people will come to want: five text sizes, no choice of fonts. One of the biggest hurdles that the marketing of Bento has to overcome is to make it plain that these are flexible means to an end - although the (new) user's first contact with the program will be the 20 templates that come with the software. These templates are shells; they are not one and the same as the data which they are used to present. If the designers of Bento have understood just what it is that a majority of users want in terms of the payoff between interface and ease of use as opposed to in depth functionality, then they have surely got a winner on their hands. The number of downloads (a quarter of a million) in the first few months since Bento became available suggests that is the case.

Address Book and iCal integration
By default Bento has Libraries for contacts, events, and tasks. These are the same as those in Leopard's Address Book and iCal; they are not synched. Although these Libraries can be removed - ""Disconnected"" - from Bento in its ""Home"" menu, to do so is to lose access to those applications' data. What's more, to edit in Bento - or worse delete - data that's derived from Address Book and iCal is to lose it directly from those same applications actually outside the Bento environment. Integration is tight: you could drag and drop a set of contacts from the Address Book Library right into Bento's Source list to create a Collection. This ""disconnection"" could usefully be supplemented by a preference letting you work from a duplicate and/or advising you that you could conceivably lose permanently (unless backed up) data of which you might have thought you were only working on a copy.

Import-Export
Bento supports only CSV (Comma Separated Value) for import and export of data, although there are ways aplenty to convert that after or before the fact. So that's a limitation only inasmuch as you may need another utility and two steps. The importer is drag-and-drop then Wizard-based and worked very well in testing. The Wizard asks which values from the file to be imported should correspond with which fields in Bento.

Relations
The way that Bento handles relations - the fields in other tables whose data you need to appear in the current one - is one of the program's main limitations: it's not a conventional relational database. But, again, it's an approach designed to give the greatest likely desired power with the simplest steps.

In your ""local"" Library you create a field of type ""Related Records List""; then you indicate from which Library you want to use data. Dropping that field on your form displays a small empty table corresponding to the ""remote"" Library. You click the ""Add related records from a list"" icon at the bottom of the inset table to see actual data. Bento displays the corresponding list of records from the associated library. Changing records in the one changes them in the other. Deleting a record in the ""local"" Library only deletes it only from the Related Records List (the ""local"" dataset) and not from the associated Library. This more closely follows the practice of removing a record from a Smart Folder, Collection or Playlist. It's a way of preventing mistakes - although not entirely logical, until you're used to it. It's also another example of ease of use; accessibility takes precedence. Note, too though, that Smart Collections cannot include data from related tables. That may be a significant restriction for some.

What is likely to be a real drawback, though, is the fact that by ""Related Records"" Bento means essentially a ""Portal"" to all the records in the ""remote"" Library. There is no concept of a ""Join"" using Primary and Foreign Keys. This means that you cannot be selective in the way you relate and view such records.

Conclusions
Bento is a package. A compromise. MyMac's advice is that - after reading this review - you match what it can do against your needs. Almost certainly you may have requirements which Bento seems unable to meet. But look closely. Sure, its interface is user-friendly - and more important, perhaps, Bento itself is easy to use. But this doesn't mean it's in any way crippled and ""less than"" comparable databases of this level of complexity - relational features aside.

It's much closer to Pages, Numbers, iPhoto, iTunes in feel and scope than it is to FileMaker. But prolonged use for this review has revealed that Bento can easily be made to do more than might be apparent even from glancing familiarity with the delightful sophistication of the interface.

Given some of the things that Bento can do, there's a remarkably high ratio between effort and result. Whether or not it's for you will depend firstly on whether you have Leopard. Then on your data handling requirements: total size of data set, complexity of relations and perhaps the way (or whether) you use iCal and Address Book. Then you should decide whether one of the absent features (scripting, full control over template fonts, a missing calculation, say) rules it out.

For many users the extremely pleasing appearance of Bento will be a winner. How nice to be able to work in a fully Mac-like environment using an inventory of - car parts.

A balance has been struck: users with complex, evolving and intricately relational databases may still be best with FileMaker Pro. Those for whom the lure of an elegant user interface is important and/or who want a direct equivalent of Numbers, Pages and iPhoto/iTunes and/or seamless integration with iCal and Address Book should look seriously at Bento. Download the trial, use it carefully and draw on the many sources of online help, remember its very reasonable price, decide whether you'll be able to make Bento do a variety of things for you larger than the dedicated software mentioned at the beginning of this review can do - and see!

Pros: the interface - it's good-looking, simple and easy to use; many data types supported; integration with Address Book and iCal; templates work with many types of file; works with iPhone and .Mac

Cons: the interface - the changes you can make to its appearance are somewhat limited; poor relational capabilities; mass updates to records not supported

Only rudimentary credits and text can be added.  The Chroma key allows green/blue screen effects for putting animations onto different backgrounds.  Saved project can be improved and exported to a variety of formats or to YouTube or Facebook, but frames must be duplicated to convert any slow rate to required 25/30 fps.

It's compatible, almost exact in the interface and easy to use right out of the box, without having to read a manual. My only complaint is its price. Word Perfect Office offers an alternative to Microsoft Office, but it isn't cheaper.

6800,4.0,False,"04 13, 2013",AL3MFYSK9HKCL,B008YTAGIK,,Amazon Customer,"So way back when Parallels and Fusion first took off, I decided to jump to one bandwagon and stick with them through the long-haul.  I decided Fusion, because I liked the idea of being able to use both Mac OS and Win OS at the same time.  Parallels allowed for dual-boot, but not at the same time (from what I understood from the marketing).  Flash-forward to today: Fusion has had ups and downs, and although I'll stick with it, if you want performance, you want Parallels.

UNBOXING:
First of few Amazon shipments that came in a box sized to the item inside.  Inside the Fusion box, it came with install DVD, USB stick and instructions.

REVIEW:
So, the gist of this is that it's Fusion 4 with some slight add-ons.  Although the box claims 1.4x faster than Fusion 4, I don't really recognize any speed advances on my old MacBook.  Fusion 5 allows for syncs with Retina Display, USB 3.0 and more memory utilization.  However, my MacBook is from 2007 and doesn't have any of that.

So then I went over to see what Parallels offered, and man, I was blown away by some of the upgrades it's had over the years.  Now, when benchmarked versus Parallels 8, we see that in 8 out of 9 evaluations, Parallels out benchmarks Fusion by lots.  Check out the review at macobserver dot com.

OVERALL:
Whereas my dated MacBook wouldn't really notice the difference between Fusion 4 and 5, I think it would probably do better on Parallels 8.  However, I'm keeping with the Fusion warhorse until it doesn't support my old system any more.  For all tasks I need to do: websurfing, office products and light gaming, Fusion will work for me.","Nice Update for VM Fusion 4, But You Could Do Better.",1365811200,,
