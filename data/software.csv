I had high hopes that this program would help address the first issue. No such luck. But it's an awesome Paint program.

WRT Photoshop - the program claims Photoshop compatibility, and this is true, inasmuch as it can open .psd files. It even preserves layers. What it doesn't do is bring in anything path- or object-based -- no splines, no fills, no reshaping, no manipulations that aren't bitmap/pixel rendering. If you thought the price for this as a Photoshop replacement was too good to be true, you were right.

WRT Paint - this does everything you ever wanted from that toy. Layers (as mentioned above), a much less useless zoom feature, all sorts of fun brushes and effects (with stylus pressure support), pixel-based transforms, and even a better-designed color mixer. Sweet.

Once I stopped expecting too much from it, the program was a lot of fun to play with, with a few annoyances. First annoyance -- the help function takes you to the help files for Painter itself, not Essentials. So, you will read about this cool feature, and then, at the bottom of the page, be presented with an apologetic ""Some features described in the Help are available only in Corel Painter 2015, and are not included in Painter Essentials 5. For more information about Corel Painter 2015, visit http://www.painterartist.com/""  (which is a store link). Essentials is the teaser for the more expensive program (which does support paths), and Corel makes no attempt to hide this. Second, as with all Corel's graphics programs, this software can only be installed once. Were you planning on changing machines any time soon?  Well, unless the first machine fails catastrophically, you can't take this with you.

Given the relatively low price of this package, I would still recommend it to budding artists and fingerpainting kids of all ages. It's not a professional tool, however, and doesn't really claim to be.

(Note - if you're looking for a real artist tool in this price range, check out Autodesk's Sketchbook Pro.

I loved art class in school because I had a whole room full of supplies, though I hated cleaning up. I was really looking forward to using this software because it simulates all of that messy stuff which is fun to use but not convenient. Fun times ahead!

It's mostly a fairly straightforward painting/editing program, but it has a whole ton of ""brushes"", both simulated real art tools (paint brushes, pens, spatulas, airbrushing, etc) and some wacky fun stuff like the ""image hose"" which lays down a trail of objects. If you're a skilled hand artist, or planning to become one, many of the brush types will be very useful in creating digital images which do look very much like they were created with brush, pen, or sponge strokes.

However, for what I expected to be a pretty high-end piece of software, I was disappointed with some quirks.

To avoid using the word ""tool"" (often used to refer to editing tools) and also avoid calling everything a ""brush"", I will refer to all simulated things as implements.

Some of the implements are too perfect and constant, and obvious patterns show. The ""loaded palette knife 2"" strokes with a pattern you might expect from a scraping painter's knife, but it NEVER CHANGES, down to the pixel. And unlike some of the other implements, there's no rounding or smoothing of the stroke to make it look convincing. It's exactly what you would get by copying and dragging a row of pixels in a paint program on an old DOS box. See the uploaded image, it's loaded with patterned artifacts. Utterly useless. Some others had similar problems, but I remembered this knife as the worst.

Some implements which rotate to match the stroke direction have a similar problem. They are completely 2-dimensional, and while they make delightful swirls of texture, they ALWAYS start and end with a completely flat row of pixels, just as no object in the univers would if used to draw. Again, it looks like the obvious result of a paint program.

One feature I was initially happy to see is the ability to zoom in with the mouse's scroll wheel. Why that isn't universal I have no idea, and being a detail hawk I am constantly zooming in and out at various points. Great! But it's silly, because using your scroll wheel will only zoom in to the exact center of your screen. The program doesn't care where your cursor is! So you have to first drag over to center whatever area you want to zoom in on. How did they not think to make it zoom in on the area I am pointing at? Yes, I can drag to the area first, but zooming in & out is something I might do literally hundreds of times while working on one image.

I was not able to figure out why trying to pick the crop tool sometimes jumps my focus down to the canvass layer, which is surely the last layer anyone would want to crop and move. Unlike some other things, there was no popup telling me why it didn't want to let me crop the paint layer.

Here's another silly thing. The escape key does not un-select things. If you use the select tool, and have the dotted box around an area then either perform some action or change your mind, you want to un-select the area. In every other program I have used, either ESC or ENTER will unselect the area and let you move on with your life, which is handy because you can draw with your right hand and hit keys like that with your left. In Corel, you have to use the ""reset tool"" on the menu bar. Again, it might not seem like a big deal but it interrupts the flow of an action you might do hundreds of times while working on a serious project. And it's not like the ESC key does anything else.

And finally, though the number of tools is impressive at first, it's all about buying upgrades. Want more brushes? Hand over a chunk of cash. It looks like the ""image hose"" is the same, and you can only use leaves and tires so many times before your work looks like a child got on your computer when you weren't there.  When the program first started, this really convenient learning interface popped up. Oh good, something to get me started! Not really, they're all ""30 lecture"" bundles you have to buy. No free 5-minute intro to using Corel's mediocre interface.

It backed up all the programs and all the music, videos, photos and documents.  When I ran a restore after getting a new internal hard drive in the iMac, the iMac with the new hard drive was just like it was the night before the hard drive died (except the photo on the desktop was not on the desktop, but still in iPhoto).  I did not have to re-install and update any programs.  All I needed was the Leopard install disk (see update below) and the Time Machine external hard drive.  It took 5 hours to restore everything (193 GB), once I attached the external Time Machine drive to the fixed iMac.

That means if your Mac was lost or stolen, or if your internal hard drive died, you could have ""your old"" computer back as soon as you replaced either the computer or the hard drive.

PS  The iMac was ready with the new hard drive in 24 hours with Applecare.  It turns out that *if* I could not give up the computer right then, I could have bought an external hard drive (""Drive B"" let's call it) and restored to Drive B from the Time Machine backup drive (using the iMac), and I could have started the iMac from that external Drive, at least until I could live without the iMac long enough to get a new internal hard drive.  Same goes for a Macbook, I suppose.

The moral of this story is to use Time Machine and an external hard drive to back up your Mac!  It is so little hassle to back up and such a huge benefit to have.  (Our hard drive was six months old when it died, and it lived a much easier life than a hard drive in a laptop.)  If your hard drive died, you could be back up in 30 hours with a new internal hard drive or 6 hours with a temporary external hard drive (including an hour to go buy the temporary external drive).

My wife's Mom does not have much on her iMac that she cares about keeping.  I did not set up Time Machine  on her computer when I installed Leopard on it.  But after I have used Time Machine for a full restore, it would be so easy to restore her computer to exactly the way she is used to it, that I got an external hard drive for her computer and set her up with Time Machine.

(For your friends with Windows computers:  At the office I use a backup program for Windows called Vice Versa that is  available to download.  Vice Versa is for backing up to external drives, which we do automatically every night, keeping the newest one off-site.  There is also Mozy for Windows, which backs up online and, in theory, is the easiest solution.  But Mozy is slow, even with a cable modem, and you have to pay every year.  A Mozy restore is very, very slow.  Backing up a Mac with a .mac account might be like Mozy.  I never did it.)

Backing up always used to be a hassle.  With Time Machine the only hassle is getting the external drive ($100 to $200) and setting up Time Machine once.  This is such a small hassle and expense for the huge benefit, that it is crazy not to use Time Machine with an external drive. It is worth getting Leopard to get Time Machine.

Note, when you max out the backup hard drive, Time Machine gives you options for deleting unnecessary files, so you don't have to start a new backup drive when the first one is full.  A great feature.

Also, on the 3-year old iMac with OC 10.3, Leopard (OS X v. 10.5) ran much, much faster than version 10.3.  I did not perceive any speed difference from version 10.4 on the six-month-old iMac, nor on two Macbooks running v. 10.4, each less than a year old.

**************
8/08 update.  To do a full restore you need to have the OSX DVD and, for a Mac Air, the outboard DVD player.  We were in Berkeley, needed to do a full restore on a Mac Air, had the backup hard drive, but not the OSX DVD.  Went to Emoryville Apple Store.  Would not loan me a OSX DVD to do the restore.  Did not have any OSX DVDs in stock, so I could not buy one, either. Said that Apple would mail a restore disc to me if I called them, but I had the OSX disk at home in L.A. and needed to use the DVD that day.  (It is the same version of the same OS that came with every Mac Air, so I could not have been sneaking an upgrade.)  Best Buy was out of the OSX DVDs, too, so I could not perform the full restore.  I consider this horrible customer service. Also, the OSX DVD should be optional to do a full restore.  It might make for a cleaner install of the OS, but you should be able to restore without the OSX DVD if you don't have it with you.  And an Apple store should loan you a copy if you already bought the Apple computer, have applecare for the computer, and are not in your home city.

Also, I was 20 minutes late for my Genius Bar appointment in the Emoryville store (the closest Apple store to Berkeley by car -- there is no Apple store within walking distance of the Berkeley campus.  The closest store by Bart is in SF!) on a Sat. afternoon and they refused to help me.  They said make a new appointment for another day and by the way we are booked all weekend.  I begged and my niece begged.  People canceled their times while I stood there and they would not give me the spot, told me to wait until all the people with later appointments were helped (that is, spend the rest of the day and evening waiting for them to -- possibly -- fit me in).  Zero customer service. I was appalled.  I needed a Time Capsule for my niece but I went to Best Buy to get it because I really did not want to spend a penny at the Emoryville store.  But the next morning I needed the OSX DVD (see above).  The store did not redeem itself.

Bottom line is that I love the OS, love Time Machine, and had TWO back-to-backreally bad experiences at the Emorville Apple store, one of which could have been avoided if Time Machine did not require an OSX DVD to perform a full install, or if Apple stores would loan computer owners a copy to perform the full restore.",Get it for Time Machine!,1198454400,3.0,

Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less.  I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC.  I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work.  We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want without any extra fees, there is no limit on printing or mailing returns using the Post Office.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 Update: State returns are now available.
Original comment: For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Please check back in mid January 2015"".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return.  The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they are aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment. Hopefully there will be an update when the problem is fixed.

 The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on ""the best way to lay out a site using CSS"" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.

She has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.

She sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.

UI - at the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

Coming from a more robust version of Norton's anti-virus software to this version has proved an easy transition though not one without hiccups.

--------------------
INSTALLATION:

I received the physical disk format, however, after installing the disk and starting the installation wizard the recommended method was internet download... go figure. So I went along with that route and very quickly >15min downloaded and proceeded installing my software. Strangely the first time I entered my authentication code Norton's site indicated that my code had been previously used. I tried the code again about 20 minutes later and it worked. I should mention that if you have any anti-virus software already installed you should go ahead and uninstall it anyway as Norton will prompt you to do so.

Note that you will be prompted to create an account Norton/Symantec during installation.

--------------------
USE:

The Internet Security user interface (UI) is very familiar to me. It is basically populated with some easy to identify tiles: 'Secure' (color coded to indicate threats on your machine; green = good; 'Scan Now' which brings up a sub-menu for all types of system security scans; 'Live Update' for downloading the latest security definitions and patches; 'Advanced' for configuration. The tiles also display pertinent information including CPU usage (monitoring for spikes which are an indicator of a potential rogue application) and even when the latest definitions were downloaded and installed. The UI is good, easy to navigate, and unobtrusive.

I have this software installed on 3 machines - my primary desktop that has a SSD, 4-disc RAID storage array, and a networked NAS; along with two laptops all running Windows 7. I've found that Norton has done a great job on each system. Scan times vary, however, on my 300Gb SSD a full scan takes approximately 40-minutes for reference.

As I was already and have continuously used anti-virus software I didn't find any surprises on my systems after running my initial post-installation scans.

--------------------
USAGE NOTES:

It's perhaps just my impression but it seems that software companies tend to treat their customers a bit poorly on licensing. Norton is no exception. This software is licensed to you, you don't ""own"" it rather than lease a window of operation. That's fine and something that we've all sort of become accustomed to, however, the major problem is that this software will stop operating completely once it's 365 day operating license (the day you activate the key) is up. Prior to 2010 (as far as I can remember) Norton software would at least keep functioning outside of the subscription period though obviously not getting new updates and definitions.

The bottom line, and this is true for a lot of software and particularly anti-virus software is that you're going to have a costly bill due every year whether from Norton, Trend Micro, McAfee or whatever security company. You can mitigate this somewhat by buying last years anti-virus product. As long as the activation code hasn't been used you should be good to go. Remember that your license period doesn't start on the calendar year but only after the key is activated.

--------------------
ISSUES:

I don't usually install a lot of extensions in my browser but for some reason went ahead with Norton's Internet Security extension. This was a mistake! I'm a Chrome user and noticed that my browser immediately become slower, and prone to frequent crashes that killed every open tab. I had nothing but issues with the browser extension so I do not recommend using it, especially if you're a Chrome user!

So, I loaded the free security software that comes with Windows 7 (Microsoft Security Essentials), and in short order it identified two notorious pieces of malware (VCQ.exe and DropInSavings) plus seven lesser ones.

I own a small graphics company, small publishing company and I write for a living. I upgraded recently to a 64-bit 8-core unit that I built with the help of a software tech engineer. I've never purchased a ""brand name"" computer except years ago when CPM was the hot language of desktops. When DOS came along I started building my own. Each new upgrade is always a challenge since software makers are using more and more space to write less efficient software. That is, they dump the parts of software that are really useful and replace them with ""cute"" stuff that takes one, two, three or more mouse clicks to get to or uncover or work with than it did before -- and it always takes up much more space. Win 7 is an example of an upgrade that I refer to as a downgrade. I have been using XP Pro Professional 32 bit for a long time. I tried to install XP Pro 64 bit but it was totally chaotic, so I had to move into Win 7. I purchased my copy at Amazon. Frankly, I'd prefer to return it as ""broken,"" since I think it's a piece of junk. Apparently those who design today's working software (OS and other software) don't actually use it to make a living. In other words, they aren't self-employed and they don't find themselves relying upon a software to be efficient (time is money made or lost, depending on the amount of time a project takes). Certainly, those who designed everything after XP aren't using what they design to make a living . . .they just design stuff that looks cutesy. Take the icons in Win7. No more lists without large icons next to them and we can't make them smaller. No more Windows Explorer, either. Oh, they say they have it, but they don't. What  they have in place of WinExp is a piece of junk that probably works on an iPhone but not at all well on a desktop. I have this brand new high speed, 32 gigabyte RAM computer and it's SLOWER than the one I'm writing this review on. Yes, I have reverted to my 4 gigabyte RAM, 2-core, XP Pro computer when writing or cruising the Net or doing low space requirement work with graphics. On top of Win 7 being inefficient, Adobe has decided to change their software as well. I'm using CS6 on the Cloud with Win 7 and it's taking longer to get things done than with my older CS2 in XP. An example: Adobe dumped their extract from Photoshop and replaced with something that's, Yup, ""cute."" It doesn't extract well at all, though, so I have to keep this CS2 in this computer and do all that work here (Win 7 doesn't like CS2). Win 7 64 bit also demands a high price for replacing all software from the 32 bit, so even though they tell you that you can use the compatibility mode, it's a lie. Yes, you can install into it, but it runs at the same speed as your older computer whether it's 2-core or 4 or 8 core. Compatibility simply means yes, you can install here and using the (86) mode you can run it.

Bottom line is, there's way too much to list here that doesn't prove efficient once Win 7 is installed. I should have written every single major bump in the road down, but I didn't. I just packed up the computer and placed it into my wife's office and said, ""You now have the world's fastest email computer."" So, we have four computers here. Hers with Win 7 and all the rest with XP. Too many programs would not install and we lost the use of three peripherals including one printer, and two scanners.

So, we'll keep on working with old nuts and bolts on three computers and hope that someday, somebody will design fast, efficient, non touch screen OS software that really works and works with all our software.

We use vector graphics for laser etching (provided by a local trophy company) of gift products and the CorelDraw program worked perfectly, allowing us to provide the files ready for the etcher. The interface is intuitive and also works well with my Bamboo drawing tablet, which is a big plus.

The Photo-PAINT application is fairly good for photo editing, especially if you don't already have an editing program on your PC. This has a range of correction and special effects filters that are easy to apply. I use Adobe Photoshop for most of my photo work, so this program will not be getting a lot of use.

Installation was very straight forward and took about a half hour start to finish on my aging laptop running Windows 7. The included tutorials are very helpful and did help me come up to speed much faster than poking around the programs on my own.

Initially I had some difficulties with the program - first, it would take a very long time (upwards of 20 minutes!) to launch, and the program had real problems with Font menus. A few simple tweaks to Word, and to my font management software solved these issues. Now all my Office:Mac 2008 applications open swiftly and work smoothly.
A problem I had with the 2004 version of Word in particular was that there was a slight lag between keystroke and monitor update, so my typing was always a few words ahead of what was visible on my screen. With the '08 version, this has gone away.
If there is a flaw in the program, it would actually have to be that the new Mac-like interface has changed where tools and features are located, so I find myself having to learn my way around the program all over again. I hate to say it but I miss the old menu and toolbar structure.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the new offering and some of the key upgrades that are now available; with one minor drawback. For positioning sake let me state first that I'm reviewing the product from a business users standpoint however, all of the key upgrades are advantageous to the home and student user as well.

Overall Thoughts

The Microsoft Office team did a great job of reconfiguring the Office 2010 menu/""ribbon"" feature that was introduced with Office 2007. The new ribbon is easier to customize and reduces the need to flip back and forth due to key functions being buried in the ribbon.
Power Point 2010

For a very long time the one thing that has been missing is the ability to embed video into a slide. Well they finally did it! You can embed video into your presentation if you would like. The thing that makes it a five star feature is that Microsoft has added the ability to edit the embedded video inside of the power point slide with no additional software needed. It's not a professional class video editing software package but it will get the job done and it is intuitive to use.

Another great feature of Power Point 2010 is the addition of a broadcast feature. You can now ""broadcast"" a presentation to people even if they do not have a copy of Office installed. All they need is a compatible web browser: Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox. This feature helps out tremendously with cross-platform compatibility issues.

Excel 2010

I use a lot of graphs in my job and the one thing I hated about Office 2007 was how difficult the ribbon system made making a chart with any customization, such as, layering two sets of data with two different vertical axis's. It was so difficult that it just flat stunk and made me long for Excel 2003. Excel 2010 makes that much easier, not perfect, but easier.

The most significant improvement is the addition of ""Spark"" lines. These are small ""micro"" graphs that are contained in a single cell. Each line of data can have its own micrograph and executive summary, very nice feature.

Outlook 2010

The look and feel of Outlook 2010 is more modern and less cluttered than its Office 2007 counter part. The absolute best feature that was added to Outlook 2010 is the preview feature for appointment/meeting requests. The new feature embeds a slice of your calendar into any meeting request and allows you to scroll through your calendar on the requested day and time to see if you wish to accept. No more switch from view to view in order to determine your availability. This has been a huge time saver.

OneNote

Office 2010 now comes standard with OneNote. I have used this product since its initial beta testing and it has become a mainstay for collecting data from meetings and customer research. The must have software group that has been missing for a while.

The one missing piece

I've been using Microsoft's Business Contact Manager for a few years now and I was very disappointed to see that it was not part of the disk version of Office 2010 Pro. In fact, in talking with friends that still work in IT they can't even figure out how to download or get the application off of Microsoft's site. This is after Microsoft made such a big deal out of the new features and how ""customizable"" the application was for the 2010 release. BCM is a great way for companies or entrepreneurs to have CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tools without spending a fortune on one of the enterprise packages such as [...] or Siebel. It's a big miss for the Office team.

For those that have been putting off upgrading because the value position from 2003 to 2007 was light; now is the time. You will get a much better product with 2010 when compared to Office 2003 or Office 2007.",Someone at Microsoft Must Have Been Listening,1284595200,,

Like previous upgrades, there isn't too much of a difference in Excel and Word other than a few things, it is Outlook which has the largest improvements.  I really like the new look as it uses ""screen real-estate"" much more efficiently.  The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.
However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.
And Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.

Every iteration of this software brings new features, and improved stability - especially for Mac, and this software is for two platforms, including Windows.

You would not paint with your mouse, so you'd need a tablet (I recommend a Wacom (If you have the cash, their Cintiq is amazing, because you are actually painting right on a display of your painting and drawing).  If not, there are some much less expensive tablets that bring a plethora of features as well, like pressure-sensitivity and such. The pens that come with them all have features, as the tablets that are customizable.

I have found that the community of experts, and Corel affiliated Painter masters, are teachers, artists, software creators, and tech people.  They often donate a more than a fair amount of media that they have created, that mimic real world media, and you can load them on your computer.  How would you like to have brushes mimic cloud formations, trees and tree leaves, water, and even skin textures for portraits.  Also, there is a great amount of videos, advice, and demonstrations on their blogs, websites, and You Tube.  I've been taught by several Painter masters in inexpensive classes, as well as one-on-one classes.

When your warranty is up you may renew it.  You can get deals included sometimes with a couple of free hour lessons with a master. Just to let you know, the price may increase as you click on the link, and you need to make sure that you get the special on the page with the link. May have been a bug.

Actually, if you follow these Painter Masters by doing a Google search, and peruse their websites and who they provide links to, you will see some very good resources, at a very low cost or free.  I cannot remember all their names, but WOW! I've found some similar resources for Adobe Photoshop, but this thing with Corel Painter is so special to me. I even have a Master as a private tutor online at a very reasonable price!!

The product interface, features, and tools:

Painter is set up amazingly similar to Photoshop, like dock-able palettes and have many other like features, tools, capabilities; though, Photoshop is not Painter and vice versa.

Painter 2015 has a fun new feature, called particle brushes (so creative), and other new features as well  The previous versions brought features like the Perspective tool, and symmetry tools for those who need help drawing objects like buildings, and reflections in water, for example.  Kaleidoscopes can challenge the talented, even though most anyone can use the Kaleidoscope tool, and have it look Awesome.

Corel, in it's inception, from what I understand, was derived from a different company, and as well as I can remember,  there was a brilliant set of filters, called KPT collection = Kai's power tools.  They were brilliant, and could challenge any brainiac artist with endless possibilities, as well as make non-artists look more talented.  Well, that is how I feel about, for example, the brush creation engine within Painter.  It is so complex, and there are seemingly endless possibilities to customize existing native brushes (there are sooo many of them to begin with) to mimic nature and special effects; in my opinion it is much better than Adobe's current brush-making technology, though I use both, because digital artists are using both, hence it has been worked out that the two are not only used together by Painter masters,  but there are built-in compatibility features, tying them both in together if you will, as with Painter's ability to import Photoshop files.

I am taking more brush-engine classes, mainly because I am interested sunsets, landscapes, atmospheric renderings, and maybe even Aurora Borealis renderings.  If I make my own brushes it will help me to be knowledgeable to not only create what I envision, but know the possibilities and limitations of said brushes. The class is less than $50. In my opinion, this deal is sweet.  You can take online classes for beginners, intermediate, and master classes from Corel training partners.

You can extend your media choices multi-fold, like making and loading new brushes, patterns, papers for textures like real artist's canvas, masks, and much more, even abstract. And, yes, there are layers, masks, and channels, as well as layer settings similar to Photoshop, and Corel's own set of filters from decoration, and special effects, to color correction.

It is impossible for me to say all that this wonderful tool can do in a review, but get prepared to be blown away.  It can be as deep or as shallow as you desire.  Corel's website has a lot of videos, introducing the beginner, and veteran artist/user. Please register your software.

You don't have to be a real artist.  I am a hobbyist, trying to be an artist, but be prepared to be blown away by all things Corel Painter.  It is a deep program. No art supplies necessary, and you have convincing oils, watercolors, gouache, acrylics, pencils, pastels, pens, markers, and much more.

When you open up Painter flip through the many fine art and concept art paintings that are made by masters, some whom you can meet through the internet, or in books about Painter.

Beginners and masters may use the cloning features differently I believe.  Clones of course are copies, and it is difficult to explain in one review, but it takes knowledge of Painter's capabilities to realize that one can use a combination of cloning and talent to make something that one would have to admit, can just take talent, frankly.  Not at all cheating.  Art.  I would name names here, but I would inevitably leave someone out. I have seen that the auto-painting feature can render a photo to look as if it is painted - sort of.  Beginners will have fun, and masters use this feature creatively, and with creative uses of it.

Do I need to say I highly recommend?  Have fun, and save money on art supplies.  The digital art revolution is for traditional artist too (you can mix the media even).  From what I have read, though many artists disagree with, and I agree with, the revolution can be compared to the digital photography revolution, many years ago.  It took time for people to regard the resulting images as art.",Real media simulation + much more!,1412985600,2.0,

It's very good at that...nice to be able to easily add voiceover to video. It does some things with conversions that many of the (easier, more affordable) video editors for PC don't, so that's something, since the software choices for Mac are so limited. However, the install was glitchy from the beginning and in use the program frequently crashes. I never had this problem with Toast 10, so I'm thinking it doesn't work well with an older MacBook Pro.

When they ask me how I did a specific techniques, the tools are just not available in Photoshop to do the same thing. What takes a few steps and layers in Painter, takes a lot more work and steps in Photoshop.

It does take a bit of time to become really comfortable with the program. But once you are comfortable, the variations possible make it a great product for digital artists. The brush tips, the patterns and shape tools make it easy to create an image from scratch. Working from a photograph, you can learn to make photo art that just pops.

Next year, I plan to enter the digitally manipulated photo section in our state fair, and this is the program I'm using. Because it will do everything that I want it to.

The tools are laid out well, and very intuitive. If you're an absolute beginner, then I do recommend trying some tutorials to get really comfortable with the tools and what they can do.

Jentsch,"I have been using this program on a PC with Office 2007 installed, and upgraded from Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager (BCM). Two POP3 accounts were managed, and about 100-125 business contacts were tracked. I have four years' worth of E-Mail stored, amounting to thousands of E-Mail messages.

For those contemplating an upgrade from Outlook 2003 with BCM, you should do so. BCM is a good idea, but the 2003 version (even after the service packs) were not as good as they could have been. The 2007 version is definitely an improvement in every way except speed, but I'll get to that in a moment.

The E-Mail features of Outlook 2007 are pretty good. The ability to set up rules to auto-process incoming messages is very good, much like the 2003 version. The search folders and new flagging options are very handy to make it easier to find messages according to a variety of filters/searches. The fact that you can flag a message for follow-up at a later time, and have that appear as a notification and on your to-do list is very handy. I have yet to make full use of all of those related features to the best of their potential.

Spam filtering is a weak point, but no worse than in the 2003 version. The simplified profile-based filtering with the ability to set up white lists and black lists is very basic compared to more sophisticated bayesian filtering available in other packages. I installed the SpamBayes add-on filter (freeware) which uses Bayesian filtering, and it's much more flexible in classifying spam messages. Spam filtering is so important these days, and when freeware packages do it better than a $100+ product from the likes of Microsoft, the people at Redmond should be embarrassed.

The BCM works very well. Being able to track E-Mail messages, calendar events, to-do items, and other items to customers is very cool. I've not used other contact managers, so I don't know how it compares, but it serves my needs, so I haven't looked elsewhere.

Its limited spam filtering ability is nothing compared to the speed issues encountered when incoming messages are retrieved from my two POP3 accounts. When the messages are being retrieved, Outlook stops cold. If you are typing a message, you can forget about continuing until the incoming messages are processed. It's incredibly frustrating to see a well-equipped machine brought to a halt, but that's exactly what happens. It's not a result of high CPU usage; a look at the CPU meter shows that neither processor meters is pegged when it happens.

It was really bad in 2003, and just a little better in 2007, but still not acceptable. I have tried many different things, including archiving more messages into the archive.pst file instead of the outlook.pst file, but the improvements were only minor.

Some would consider Outlook to be the embodiment of evil. As a person who came from using unix-based E-Mail (pine and elm anyone?), to PMMail for both OS/2 and Windows, I didn't have any problem getting used to Outlook and appreciating the extra features it brought to the table. Like anything, it's more often the operator behind the keyboard than the software on the computer.

Again the app versions are useless and unneeded as you have the fully functional versions on your desktop so who the hell wants the half baked, limited phone app version with half the features.  Why ahve two versions on internet explorer?  Well the desktop version sucks and you will be seeing ""internet explorer has stopped working"", script errors and bugs ALOT!

I have had three computers brick with Windows 8.  Two were brand new laptops and one was a one and a half year old desktop PC.  All three had the same issue.  When booting up for the first time everything seemed to go fairly well, once logged in things were a little laggy and unstable and required updates.  Once the updates were almost all installed it began doing the required restarts and thats where the problems bagan.  Some of the updates were broken causing an infinate restart loop until eventually (sometimes days later) it would say there was an error installing updates reverting to previous installation.....that was good except for it never did revert and only stayed on the ""reverting to previous version"" screen forever.  I returned the two laptops for a refund and had to buy a new PC even microsoft support said to return them and they were toast.  Garbage.

When I got it, I was thinking it would be just like the Windows edition, just with the traffic light buttons at the top.  I love how everything is floating (not constrained in a Windows; you have toolbar at top, tasks in the middle, and any other items float on the desktop), this is great for when you need to open other files and still view QuickBooks, since you can put the windows side by side and still see both documents (for example copying a contact from the address book to Customer List is simple since the two small windows can sit right by each other and you can just copy and paste each item).  The next great thing is the installation, like many Mac apps it was simply a drag and drop to the application folder and it was installed.  I then was able to activate with the License and Product number and register online, super simple (took about 2 minutes).  The software was easy to set up (I have used QuickBooks for Windows in the past and am familiar with the software), my only flaw is that the first time I used it closed (red exit) on the Company Home Page and the toolbar trying to close QB, but then found I had to Quit from the Dock (or Menu), when I reopened QB, nothing was their and I had to go to Company >> Company Home, and Show Company Toolbar to get it -- Just FYI, I learned that I need to Quit from the Dock or the Menu.  The program opens very quick on my computer (I am using Mac OS X Lion [10.7.2]) and I love the number indicator lights on my items to show me what I have out their at a glance (for example a red number on Invoice to show how many open invoices I have [like on the Mail App for New Mail]).  I was able to set up my accounts with just the Default settings for my industry and was able to create my item list and Customer list very easily, the Help >> Search section is great since if you are looking for a list or setting you can type it in and it will find it for you (and show you where in the menu it is, and you can open it from their).  In the box their was a paper to show you how to import Windows based QuickBooks files, however, since I used to use Simple Start (Free for Windows), I created a new company, since I wanted the full settings from the start.

Another point I want to show, is how much of an improvement the look and feel of the software is.  I love how I can view my invoices or payments or estimates just by using the info on the left and then I can scroll through them flawlessly and view live information on the invoice or go into Preview Mode and scroll through each invoice without having to open Print Preview, as well as see quick info on the customer (like Customer Info and recent transactions!).  This software has such a genuine feel to it, which just makes it perfect!  I can see everything of my business in a quick glance without having to go through lists of information and then opening and closing widows till I find the one, this is an amazing edition of QuickBooks and is just perfect for me as a freelancer!

I also want to add how great support for QuickBooks programs are!  I use QuickBooks POS at work and had the best experience setting it up with the help of our representative and the online community.  Just as I am seeing on this product with the number of Manufacture Replies, I am seeing great customer service who is trying to help customers at every point of the experience.  I have used phone support and online support for my Intuit products in the past and have never had a bad experience.  I am glad to see the Manufacture comments on other reviewers, as that shows me that Intuit is ensuring that their products are working properly and are listening to customer feedback!  And just like our POS system I know if I need help their is entire community of Intuit product users who can help me just by me posting a question or finding others with the same inquiry.

First off, it installs easily enough, and quickly, on Win 7.  Installation was no problem.
I was then presented with an options menu.  I really didn't quite understand enough ABOUT the program to really set any options, so I thought I'd just start the program.
I was forced to watch a movie on posture and fingering.  I suppose if I'd known better I could have turned it off in options, but I'm not the type to study a program before I use it.  I just want it to work- intuitively would be nice.
I'm impatient, and felt like I lost time out of my life I'd never get back suffering through those movies that are slow, plus Mavis just talks so slow.  Only beginning typists might need this.  I'm already a proficient typist, but I'd love to type 110wpm.
The skills assessment test was easy enough, though it took off points for an old timer like me that double spaced between sentences.  Still I did well enough to move up to level 3.
The problem was the lessons tried to start me at level ONE.  I had missed that I had to manually set my lessons up to start in options.  It would be really nice if the program had done this FOR me.  It is software and software is all about automation first, rich media second in my mind.
I couldn't find the options menu.  It's not on the main screen that you use most.  I clicked everything, I stopped and restarted the program- how ANNOYING.  Of course that's when I realized it was labeled as PREFERENCES under a screen that comes up when you first start the software.  It's worth time to spend a lot of time in PREFERENCES if you are somewhat proficient and simply want to increase your speed.
It still took me to lesson 1, home row.
Is it too much to ask that I be able to choose the lessons that I want to do?  I got pretty fed up with it in the 4 times I sat down to try to use it.  I have a cheap Sponge Bob typing program I liked better than this one.  This is just boring, and it's not at all intuitive and it wants to control everything I do while using it.
The actual lessons are much the same- you can see the fingers type as you watch the screen.  I did learn this way on my own and it works.
I suppose for absolute beginners or for people that like very structured learning, this is fine.  It's just not for me.  My son is a very self-directed learner too, and I don't think this would work for him either.  I'll keep looking.

As of December 2010 the announcement is official that the newer version will completely eliminate (and by this I mean ""break"") the way hard drives are managed in the current version.  What this means to you is that if you purchase this version of the Windows Home Server OS, you will be headed for a dead-end if your Windows Home Server hardware does not have its own RAID controller.  There are other workarounds for the issue, but those that I have seen thus far are complicated.  If you are looking at purchasing Windows Home Server, you might want to hold off until the new version comes out, or else commit yourself to staying with this version.

NOTE:  This product has gone far beyond the item listed here and is, as of 12/2009, up to ""Power Pack 3"".  If you cannot find a newer release of this product, make it a point immediately after installation to allow the Server to update itself before trying to properly set up the rest of your Windows Home Server.  It will save you a lot of trouble if you do this because the updates resolve a lot of issues.  Most importantly, Power Pack 3 adds compatibility with Windows 7 and fixes some serious problems with file indexing.

Windows Home Server (or ""WHS"") seems to serve two purposes:

1) to provide a very simple way of doing every useful ""home network"" type of task without having to know much about servers

2) to prevent anyone who is not a home user from trying to use the OS as any sort of formal Windows Server (such as for a business or as a web server)

This means that if you come from a background of managing servers and are used to managing things at the OS level, you really need to let that go. Things that seem like a can't-fail performance tweak or a standard ""best practice"" will actually destabilize Windows Home Server and eventually lead you off to rebuild-land, wondering how things went wrong.  Remoting into a Windows Home Server using anything besides the Windows Home Server Console will corrupt the installation and cause problems (more on this in a moment), once again leading you to rebuild.  This is a case where when Microsoft says, ""We don't support you doing that,"" they mean it.

The good news is, if you want to have your own server at home and you want it to be hassle-free, Windows Home Server will fit your needs.  99% of the tasks you perform are all in one place:  the Windows Home Server Console.  This rich graphical interface drives everything you'll do in managing and configuring your server.  It simplifies tasks and provides quick at-a-glance information on your server's status.

So what are some of those features?

Backup and mirroring:  Windows Home Server will enable you to back up your home computers to it.  These backups update themselves on a schedule that you set and can later be used to restore the machine if things go wrong.  Instead of using RAID for disk redundancy, Windows Home Server uses a technology called ""folder duplication.""  It seems bizarre to omit RAID from a server that's supposed to keep redundant copies, but here in Windows Home Server, it really is better suited to the OS' design.  It is also closely customizeable, allowing you to specifically set which folders should be duplicated for data protection.

Disk management:  it's easy to add or remove extra drives.  WHS uses drive letter mapping to make all volumes the ""D:\"" drive.  This drive letter is a logical mapping off the root physical volume, and your C:\ drive is deliberately limited to a much smaller volume in order to make restoring the server a snap on those hopefully-rare occasions when you have to.  Storage is balanced across volumes automatically and while watching it happen on my MediaSmart Ex495 I rarely see it impact performance.

Media sharing and streaming:  Using simple ""Music, Photos, Videos"" categories, you can control how to share media and also enable or disable streaming.  You can also enable/disable integration with Windows Media Center. Windows Media Center on your PCs will easily pick up on the existence of the server and walk you through installation of the plug-in once you have enabled this feature.  I found WMC integration to really be dirt-simple to set up and useful to have on all my machines, and I'm betting it integrates really well with an X-Box 360 as well.  I've used it with my Playstation 3 and it's been very easy to access through the PS3's Media Bar (or ""XMB"").  There are also the Firefly Server (which I have not used closely) and TwonkyMedia, which provides an alternative way of managing and streaming your content.  Last, there is iTunes functionality but I have not used this feature (there are many, MANY forums that can help you with this if you'd like to learn more).

The hard part of Windows Home Server is recognizing that it is best used on its own terms:  use the Windows Home Server Console to access the server and its settings, use the Windows Home Server Toolkit to do deeper ""expert"" tasks (and try to avoid doing these unless you have to), and most importantly do not remote into the box.  Windows Home Server carefully manages the installation and configuration of software, and accessing these programs from outside the console can cause problems.  More importantly, Microsoft's Windows Update pushes updates based on the machine's server core.  Windows Home Server uses Server 2003 as its core.  In plain English this means that Windows Home Server appears to Microsoft Update as if it's a Server 2003 box.  When the Console controls the updates, it is capable of filtering out the Server 2003 updates that are intended for WHS and those that aren't.  Remoting into the box will cause Windows Update to call and answer with the full list and add updates to the queue that WHS really shouldn't have.  Which is to say nothing of the default behavior of Remote Desktop Connection, which is to assume you want to share resources (such as printers, faxes, scanners on the network) with your remote session and try to install the drivers on the server while you're connected.

If you want a simple home media server, Windows Home Server will provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-manage, self-maintaining way to do it.  However, you have to work within its rules and you need to be willing to let go of the lower-level things a typical Server administrator will do.  If you want a robust and configurable server machine that allows you to customize to your heart's content, you may not be happy with the loss of control WHS requires.  You might consider just installing your own server and being done with it.",Best if Used on its Own Terms,1267142400,10.0,

I've had McAfee products that brought my computer to its knees and ZoneLabs products that interfered terribly with Internet browsing.  I haven't noticed any glitches so far with Bitdefender 2010.  It's the most transparent suite I've used.

I installed this software on a Pentium 4 HT with 2gb RAM that runs WinXP Pro.  Firefox still clips along, and the antivirus engine does a pretty quick job of working through the nearly 400gbs of files I've got on the 500gb hard drive.

There are many customizable options in the Bitdefender interface.  None of it is confusing, but there are a lot of options.  The software operates simply, though.  It doesn't throw numerous alerts at you every time you do something on the PC.  It knows which new programs to trust (whitelisting?) and allows them access through the firewall.  I haven't had a problem with malware on this machine.  It seems to be doing just fine.

In all, this is a worthy contender.  I rate it right up there with Kaspersky 2010, my other favorite suite at the moment.

PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.

Pros:

Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.

Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)

The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.

Cons:

The sharpen slider in the Quickfix studio works in chunks rather than in a linear fashion - 0,50 etc.  You must type in a sharpen amount in the box next to the slider and then sharpen in a linear fashion - 28,29,30,31 etc.  Serif verified this bug in Sept 08.

The makeover studio requires several steps similar to Adobe Photoshop - creation of editing masks.  Paintshop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate thankfully does not require the creation of masks to do makeover tasks.

I have had very good success with Trend security software and my previous satisfaction with this product led me to obtain a copy of this latest Trend product. I haven't been disappointed in the least. Right from the beginning, this software product proves its usefulness, starting with the quick installation. The software installs so quickly you wonder if something wasn't done correctly or if you missed a step. But it really is that fast and it goes to work immediately, pretecting against threats and providing much needed peace of mind.

I have used a few other security software products in the past and many have proven acceptable, but still had their annoyances and the chief one is the tendency of many security software products to slow down your computer. Trend security software doesn't cause this problem. My computer runs as fast as normal and if I didn't know it, I wouldn't even guess that security software was installed at all. Another annoyance is pop- up reminders. Now, I realize that some individuals like these reminders because they consider them an extra layer of protection. But I would rather not see the reminders to check for threats and just remember to click the appropriate link and view them when I want to. Trend spares you the constant reminders while protecting your computer they way you want to be protected.

Another area where Trend Micro shines is with parental controls. My girls are young but they are slowly developing an interest in computers and I feel much better knowing that my Trend parental settings are in place, protecting against the possibility that one of my kids will link into the wrong site. And I like that Trend offers so many different levels of child protection. This allows a parent to select the appropriate level for the age of the child.

This time, however, I upgraded from Quicken 2012 Premier to Quicken 2013 Deluxe, primarily to use the new Quicken iPhone app. (I settled for Deluxe rather than Premier because I haven't found myself needing the extra features of Premier.)

Like last year, the upgrade and registration was easy and mostly automatic. It noticed and removed my previous version, and restored its data, saving a safety copy as it upgraded the data format for 2013. I also had no trouble setting up a new cloud account for use with the iPhone app. However, I did trigger an error message (org.hibernate.exception. LockAcquisitionException : An unexpected exception occurred.) when I asked to also have my budget synced to the cloud. So far as I can tell, the error was harmless, as I still see budget info on my iPhone 4 that matches what I see in the desktop app in Windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit.)

The mobile app shows the accounts I've chosen to sync with the cloud, some of which also automatically update themselves with the associated financial institution, and others of which are intentionally not set up to talk directly to their associated financial institution. (I particularly appreciate the latter group, as it's my impression that Quicken's Mint Web site only works with accounts that can be linked with the associated institution, and some of mine cannot be so linked.)

The mobile app gives me a quick overview of my current situation, both overall and in relation to my budget (which it automatically updates as my spending changes.) It also shows me the alerts I've selected, such as when spending in a particular category exceeds its budget by a specified amount, or when I'm charged a bank fee of $1 or more. (I wish there were an option to show bank fees above a penny, as I try very hard never to incur such fees.)

Overall, two hours into using the new version, I'm happy to have upgraded, and will update this later if I notice any thing else important about the new version.

I read the reviews of all of those who were saying that they were having major headaches trying to get it to download properly, and install. Then I read the reviews from those who were saying it downloaded and installed without so much as a whimper; it all went smoothly, and only took a few minutes. I noticed that those who reported a no problem install were saying they were installing it into a Vista 64 machine.

I thought the detractors must have been missing a keystroke somewhere, and after all, by downloading I was getting the latest version. The CD that you buy had to be older, and you would need a download anyhow, so why not just download it in the first place? The price was close to the same, by the time you factored in the shipping from the third party vendor. So I bought it and downloaded it into my XP machine. That is when the trouble began. It had problems every step of the way. So I decided to uninstall it and try shutting off my McAfee antivirus, as well as my Scotty the Watchdog Win Patrol that alerts me, with options every time someone tries to install a program on my machine at boot up, eating up valuable resources. Sure enough on the first install, up came the warning, and I said ""Yes"" but it stopped installing anyhow, so I shut it off, rebooted the machine, and on the third attempt, even renames the prior download, so I could download a fresh copy. (I did get a file error message somewhere along the way, so I decided to get a fresh download from the Amazon library) Well after all of that, it still didn't work. Oh it finally worked, and the program came up, after waiting about 3 minutes for it to load, and then when it did load, and I clicked on start a new return, after about 5 minutes, I decided it was frozen, and I did get a few ""Not responding"" messages when I tried to egg it on.

So I went to my other XP machine with a 2.4Mghz CPU instead of the 2.0 machine I initially installed it in, (both had 2 Gigs of ram) and this time I couldn't get it to load. Amazon is very helpful in getting the download part to work, even on a busy Sunday, 2 weeks before the deadline, but getting the Turbo Tax program to work, well that was something else altogether.

So finally I decided to give it a try in my Vista 64 Media Center PC. I downloaded it and in the middle of the download I realized it was being downloaded and installed right in the middle of recording the TV show 60 Minutes. I also had my McAfee Antivirus software running. I decided not to interrupt it. I just let it run. It fully downloaded, and all the usual prompts came up, just like before, just a lot, lot faster this time, and when it was all done, it went online, did the updates, and when I finally clicked on the ""Start a New Return"" button, it instantly flicked over to the next screen. How about that, it worked perfectly. Then I copied last year's return over the Vista PC and it drank that up, and gave me the next screen etc. No matter what I clicked on it worked perfectly. The program was running like a banshee.

So, can we conclude that it works effortlessly on a Vista machine, but it has problems with XP (Wouldn't that be a switch to all those Vista haters out there:)? Or is something in the way I ran it causes me to have 2 failures trying to load it in an XP machine, but not with the Vista?
I had to come back and edit this because with some thought I realized that I had Win Patrol with Scotty the watchdog running on both XP machines, but not on the Vista machine. What Scotty does is stop programs from loading on startup without your approval. So it pauses the load, asks is it ok, then after clicking on Ok it did not resume. So the pause turned into a halt. So if you are running Win Patrol, right click on it on the task bar and choose ""Exit"" before loading Amazon's installer installation. I did manage to work around that, and was able to access the program, but it was running like it had a corrupt file in it. Fortunately Amazon allows you to download and reinstall.

I particularly enjoyed the option of disabling the splashscreens and any update/news notices.  This is important because when my system reboots automatically those kinds of splash screens can screw up my boot process which has a complex set of scripts that are timing-dependent.

CPU usage is a major consideration with any antivirus program so that was a concern to me.  Although my server doesn't max out its cpu use, I have done a lot to minimize electricity consumption of the system.  Wasted cpu cycles increase power requirements so I do not want wasteful software running all the time.  This is particularly an issue as my system processes several dozen files in batches every minute of the day for its tasks.  With active virus scanning enabled, these files are analyzed for viral activity.  When no file activity is conducted, it seems that the antivirus system consumes an average of only 1-2% cpu power.  With active scanning going on during the batch processes that occur, cpu usage climbs up to 6-13% for a few seconds.  This isn't too bad really, and acceptable (so far) to me.

As for updating the definition files, they were pretty quick to download, no complaints there.  The registry key is good for 3 computers for 2 years.  Although some may be dismayed at the 2-year figure, I am quite impressed that the company is honest about this.  Some other company's don't mention it at all and you may think it's an infinite lifetime license, but in reality it doesn't work that way as they will obsolete your license when a major version changes in the software.  Bitdefender deserves credit for their honesty.

Overall, it looks like I'll be keeping this antivirus program on.  I will knock off one point due to the install issues highlighted earlier.  They really need to let the user select the ability to disable the firewall during the install as many will install the software remotely.","Overall good product, had some install issues",1227139200,,

OpenOffice not doing a good enough job for what you need? Are you put off by Office 2013, which doesn't offer three product keys for your trouble? Are you even more put off with Microsoft turning Office into Software as a Service with Office 365?

Well, you're going to have to accept some compromises, namely the hated Ribbon and not having all the Office apps. But there are Z number of people who have late Windows XP/early Windows Vista era PCs that are perfect for secondary production running Windows 7 from a retail upgrade disk-and when you do the clean install upgrade for Windows, which you will eventually have to do due to Windows rot, you are going to need Office and you may never get up the budget to where you want to invest in Office 2010 or later for such a low-end often barely Aero-capable PC, so this is perfect as long as you temper your expectations.

With properly set expectations and a legal copy of Office 2007 Home and Student, you can now get down to how it works.

It works by running basic Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote tasks  It's not going to wow you like a new version of Office, but a common thread I've read in hundreds of reviews for various versions and editions of Office is why do they break what works in the previous version when they release a new version? Well, by buying an older version, there are no surprises as regards what Office can and can't do, because it's been around for however many years it's been since the date the version in question (Office 2007 Home and Student, which is 7 years as of when I write this) was made.

What can it actually do? Well, Word's fully featured (as long as you're using it for home or student use.) Excel is fully featured as regards the base program (again, the same caveat applies.) PowerPoint will get your presentations done, although you'll miss some of the customizations of later versions. OneNote is fully featured, and it along with PowerPoint have the caveat that they're for home or student use. The only thing that really lacks in Home and Student versus let's say Ultimate (which I use for troubleshooting through over-engineering), is the Microsoft Office Tools-you can't expect fancy things like Business Contact Manager and the accompanying copy of SQL Server 2005 Express.

In case you're wondering, I'm reviewing this for my aunt and uncle, who sat there and bought a PC in May of 2009 and thanks to a certain ability I have to troubleshoot combined with them buying retail Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade through the Best Buy fulfillment of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option that was current at the time along with retail Office 2007 Home and Student that they beat out of HP's customer (dis)service-albeit with having to pay for it, I get to (and thoroughly enjoy) troubleshooting their PC whenever it is having an issue because I'm on a mission to keep them off of the crack Windows that is Windows 8/RT/8.1/RT 8.1/Windows Phone 8X/Windows Phone 8.1x and I thoroughly enjoy every time I can fix their PC that uses this software.

Office 2007 Home and Student was a change for them at first from the WordPerfect Office suite they were using on their old XP computer, a Dell Dimension 2400 (They replaced it with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 7750+ 4GB RAM 500GB HD HP Pavilion Slimline S5120Y. But then again so was Vista and then 7-they didn't have too much trouble with Vista, but Windows 7 Home Premium combined with this version of Office makes them able to do everything they would ever want to do with Office and a PC. When that changes, they will upgrade-and so far it's not changing.

I just think that Office 2007 (whether lowly Home and Student or mighty Ultimate or something in between like Professional) didn't deserve the reputation it got as regards the Ribbon. People were (and some still are) so angry about the Ribbon that they don't like Office because of the Ribbon. I know I am not as qualified as some people to speak due to my aversion to command line interfaces, whether of the old school DOS/Unix variety or whether of the newfangled Windows PowerShell variety, but I know this for a fact:

Once I properly configured their PC with Windows 7 Home Premium Retail Upgrade on a clean install and reimported their programs, files, and settings, they were using it productively as could be until a virus hit that forced them to pay someone way too much to repair their computer. I was able to set it right and from the moment I first showed them how to do basic things like bold, underline, italics, margins, indentation, in other words showed them where Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student put the tools they were using in WordPerfect Office, they've been happily using Office with the Ribbon.

I hate to discount those who have had negative experiences with Office 2007, because I don't like most change-especially not the licensing restrictions growing ever tighter since 2000, but I haven't had any problems with the Ribbon either.

So with the Ribbon discounted for us and our family, we can now move on to infinitely more pressing matters. Which is how does Office (specifically 2007 Home and Student) perform in real world tasks? Well, it doesn't make you have to renew the usage rights to it every year, it supports the .docx/.xlsx/.pptx trio, and it has a user interface that aside from being different is actually usable (if you can figure out what each button on each section of the ribbon is for, which ToolTips really help with that and they're on by default).

In summation, for the reasons outlined above, Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student is worth the money if you can get a legal copy. I recommend it as long as it's needs match up well with what you need out of (specifically Microsoft) Office,

Take this as you will, 2 families' experiences with Office 2007, one Ultimate, one Home and Student, which is positive and we continue to use Office 2007 to this day.","It's maybe behind the curve, but you can still do a lot with it.",1391817600,,

Running it:
You pick your video source and the device format to output it to.  The output formats are iPod, iPhone, and iTV.  Since I wanted it for the new iTouch iPod, I choose iPhone (same video specs and format as the iTouch).  If you view the video on your PC, it won't look good because it's downsampled for the small screen of the iPods.  On the iPod, it will be very good.

The time to make the conversion will depend on your computer.  I tried it on a 90 minute movie. My G5 Mac took about the same time as viewing the video (91 minutes).  On my Duo Core 2 PC, it took about 3/4 of the viewing time to render it (62 minutes).  On my Pentium 4, it took 1 1/2 times the viewing time (136 minutes).

But not much else has changed since the 2013 version. However, the Premium version is still a better bargain, over the Sage 50 Complete Accounting 2014 software, with more features.

One of the biggest peves I have with Sage is their marketing ploy on how they label the stages of product.

Basic = Pro (You'd think ""Pro"" means top of the line... here you would be wrong)
Better = Complete (Doesn't ""Complete"" mean everything, the whole package?)
Best = Premium (Does not compute)
Elite = Quantum (...Describing nature at the smallest length-scales... so shouldn't this be considered ""Basic""?)

Although you are getting a descent accounting and inventory software, they are continually marketing additional add-ons and sales pitches to buy even more of their products, which should already be inclusive to the software; as reference to their title ""Complete"". It's pretty annoying after a bit.

One of the catches with this software is that it is auto-renewing. So in order to activate this software, your going to have to give them your credit card number in order to get started. Personally, I feel this is an over-the-top lock-in, so to say. They should be more like your anti-virus subscription, letting you know that your subscription is about to expire, giving YOU the option of renewing instead of them just automatically renewing.

So if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage. So you better know right off the bat if you are ready to make a true commitment to using Sage 50 Accounting software, because that is truly what it is... a commitment!

If you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget and can absolutely commit to using this software. However, if you do not need the the Payroll & Tax software, then this is indeed a good software.

- Entered basic info,  W2 info, car taxes, mortgage interest, and the program runs a check for you to see if everything is filled out correctly. It flagged a couple boxes I didn't enter the first time, and it was fairly easy to get back to the page I needed to make the additional entries on.
- I used the help button once, typed in my question and the software answered it and took me to the location where I had to enter the information I had questions about.
- There is a live chat help button, but I haven't used it. I also think you can call to speak to a tax expert if needed as well, which is nice. There are also a good number of HR block offices within driving distance, so I'm assuming if you got stuck they could lend a hand.

- I found it helpful to click through some of the function menus to get familiar with the program before I really started. That seemed to help also.
- I did the download version to avoid having another CD sitting around, and the download from amazon was easy. The program installed, and then updated, and was ready to go. I did have to close out of the initial download screen though, it was giving me an error. So i closed it out, went to my orders, found the purchase and clicked download from there and it went smooth.
- Like I said I'm pleased with this option for my tax situation. There are other competing products, and there are other ways to have taxes done such as an office, CPA, accountant, but for me this seems like something I can handle knowing HR is there to help if it gets tricky.
- Once I e-file I will update this review on how that process went!

The program checked over the return before e filing, led me through some steps to e file, with links when needed, let me pay for the state taxes owed, paid the 19.99 fee to file the STATE..fed was free...printed it all out, it had me back it up to a flash drive, and finished up.

Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill was the first game ever created in the series-and it shows. It is definitely the worst in the series, but it still is able to give quite a fun gaming experience.

Story-The story is that your Aunt Eloise (who is the librarian at a high school) has asked you to come help solve a murder. A boy was pushed down a flight of stairs, and it's your job to find out who did it. It's a very generic story, and it really isn't developed as much as it could have been.

Graphics-They aren't good at all compared to today's graphics, but in the '90s, they were awesome. The backgrounds are 3D, somewhat, but they are VERY grainy. Still, they are done quite well. The characters in this game are cartoon characters and are slightly disappointing visually.

Sound-The music is nice in the game and sets a mysterious mood over the game. The voice acting isn't really good at all, but the background sounds are very nicely done.

Gameplay-This is a first-person point-and-click game. You simply click arrows to determine your direction. This game is a little strange in the fact that at some locations you can look up or down slightly for no apparent reason, but otherwise, it's not too hard to figure out. The puzzles in the game are fairly easy and don't require too much thought. They are mostly just finding objects to interact with other objects later in the game. You can call your friends in order to get hints, but all they do is give you a hint before hanging up; in other words, unlike other games, you cannot have conversations with your friends on the phone. Probably the most annoying aspect of the game is that you have to continuously switch discs as you switch locations in the game, which can be quite annoying.

Fun-It was fun, but it really doesn't have replay value as the others in the series do. It's too boring. It wasn't scary at all, but you can die in the game. If you do, you press second chance and you go back to the scene right before you died.

Length-It seriously took me 3 hours to play and finish. And the constant disc changing factor probably took 20 minutes of that time. It's not long at all.

I recommend this game to fans who are waiting for the next game to come out, but only if you can get it cheap. It's fun, but it is short, and it is a one time thing.

An interface that sucks being your only option across desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, and gaming console. The key words aren't, in deference to the Windows 8 fanboys, ""only option"". The real fighting words are ""that sucks.""
Some people do not feel that way, but then again they think every trend is a good one-and I saw some trends during my time in school that have me ready to deliver TKOs to innocent objects when I think back on them, and the same is true with Windows 8.
As it was with Vista, and they share important qualities. They were ever more refined implementations of a certain highly distasteful vision of computing. One that Steve Jobs did both infinitely better and equally horrid at doing simultaneously given the appropriate tools.
For this to work, it has to work better than s***. Which, despite a Start butt on, as opposed to what you get with Windows 7, is NOT the case. It's flat, colorless, atrocious, and despite all that I would be willing to put up with it if I could get the right PC to run it on.
The key is on it you spend all your time in the Metro UI and don't play music since the default Windows Metro music playing application is more limited in function than a hood ornament on a fancy vintage car-and also only venturing to the desktop when you need to change a desktop only located setting, and using free apps as much as you can.
(If I am going to pay money for apps, Apple will get my money because they're full-featured desktop applications with their only disadvantage being they're distributed like apps.)
I don't want 16-color display on a monitor supporting millions of colors, and that's why I compromised and went for 7. I gave up on the third-generation Core i3, gave up on integrated Bluetooth, but don't have Vista 2.0 or 2.1 related headaches either in the user interface or in the background processes carrying out intense extracurricular activities.
Instead I have Vista 1.1, which has a halfway tolerable amount of extracurricular activities and a UI that makes Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows 8 Pro or even Enterprise look like bloated unruly pigs.
It's not that Windows 8 sucks, it's that the vision that caused it to come to pass sucks, and not even in theory but merely in practice.
Oddly enough, I do like Metro on an Xbox-and don't give me the crap about how Windows 8 turns your computer into an Xbox. Because you have top-flight for the era graphics hardware in a gaming console and you often have graphics that are crap when it comes to games in a PC because they're different devices. With different target markets when comparing low-end PCs to gaming consoles.
And it also works well on the Windows RT Microsoft Surface (the Surface Pro has full PC power, and so that comparison falls flat, as it does with all the other permutations of laptops and desktops), but on phones, laptops, desktops, and full PC or even Atom ULCPC tablet systems Metro does not work-you want Windows 7 and Microsoft won't allow it because they want to increase the level of Vistafication and force you to accept it or push you off the Internet.
I'm about to go off the Internet before I'll adopt Vista 2.0 in the guise of the Windows 8 family, but then again I want to confirm what I have been reading. (But budget restrictions will likely nix it.)",The fanboys and haters are both right! Just not completely.,1384992000,3.0,

I've gone through at least 4 other versions and have nothing but praise for the product. It works and works well. Every version adds new features and this version, Creator NXT is no exception.

Usually I upgrade my Roxio software when I upgrade Windows and I need the newer version of Roxio to work with the new versions of Windows. I upgraded this time after going to Windows 8.  This doesn't surprise me as CD/DVD software hooks into the storage code of the operating system to do its thing. Change that code (as in a Windows upgrade) and Roxio needs to be updated. In the past, I only cared about the DVD/CD writing capabilities of Roxio. But after seeing the new software included with NXT, I find I'm really using the new programs. These new programs are Videowave (video editing), Convert (captures and converts videos to different formats), Paintshop Pro (photo editing), and Audio capture and conversion. Most of the time, you access these programs from the Roxio menu screen by selecting what you want to do and the menu launches the program you need to do the task.

Converting video to the best format to transfer to your tablet, phone, or share online.
Capture videos from websites (like Youtube).
Making slideshows from photos (including adding soundtracks) then converting to video format.

It can be setup to email or sms txt message you if there is a problem with it, it has several different built in software applications (like ITUNES server, and bittorrent downloading software), and is expandable with applications you can install through the firmware separately.

It IS a lot of money, and you could build a computer for less money, but at full load this device uses much less energy than a computer, is quieter, and QNAP is always updating the firmware with new features.

Pros

+ Standard version includes the 4 programs you actually want!
+ Like most new MS suites, allows for easier transfer between machines
+ Allows you to use on your home desktop AND your laptop!!  Huge plus!!
+ New open document format based on xml - good for techies
+ Alternatively, you can still use the doc format you know and love
+ Excel now supports larger documents with more fields!
+ Cool new Powerpoint extras
+ Once you do overcome the learning curve, design has some plusse
+ Preloaded with Vista OEM computers, so install is MUCH faster than old version

Cons

- A list price of $400 means many will forgo Outlook and buy Home & Student suite for MUCH LESS
- The ribbon puts things in WEIRD places
- Microsoft disabled classic menus so you can't find stuff ... ARGH!!!
- Startup times seem a little slower ... why????
- Strangely slow performance with Word

The general hatred for the ribbon is well known.  Microsoft Word and Excel have drawn the most heat.  It took everybody years to learn those nested menus and hard to find functions.  Now they are all moved!!!!

Actually, the ribbon wouldn't be so bad if you could have your regular old classic menus above it.  Once you learn the ribbon, there's some logic to the way things have been relocated.  Still, this was a huge blunder and I wonder if MS will back track on that.

On the plus side, this operating system is probably necessary to take advantage of modern processors like the I5 and I7. Other than that, it has caused NOTHING but trouble.

(1) A laser printer for which I paid hundreds of dollars no longer works because its available drivers won't work in the 64 bit environment.

(2) Several programs, for which I paid hundreds of dollars in good money, work poorly even after selection of older operating systems in compatibility mode. Two other programs--one of which manages my address and telephone contacts--do not work at all.

(3) Intellipoint, the software for the mouse, asks me repeatedly to insert a disk every time I start it. I have to click on this totally irrelevant box (asking me to insert a disk) seven or eight times every single time I start the computer. Uninstallation and reinstallation (more time down the drain) did not fix this. A daily annoyance from a poorly designed product.

(4) The scanner is far less easy to use on this new computer.

(5) Windows Explorer is less easy to use in the Windows 7 version than it was in Windows XP

Conclusion: with the sole exception of higher processing speeds that are probably facilitated by the 64 bit system, this operating system is a step DOWN from XP. It does not appear to me that Microsoft put much foresight into making sure that the new OS would not render hundreds of dollars' worth (or more, depending on the user's applications) of software and hardware partially usable or not usable at all. As matters stand, I will probably have to pay about $150 for a new printer thanks to this operating system. (I am also not happy with the printer's manufacturer, Konica Minolta, which has not been able to develop a 64 bit driver, but Microsoft needs to keep in mind the need to make it easy for other suppliers to develop drivers.)

First, because it is designed to take advantage of more computing power if your computer has it available. My computer does in fact have quite a bit of muscle, and I did find this version of this software to be faster. It's certainly not ""WOW"" faster, but quite noticeably faster. However, if your computer is lacking in the power department, you likely won't notice much of a difference in rendering speeds, so do take that into account.

The second reason I got this new version is because it allows me to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future.

Now, while this new version has an array of great new features, the third reason I got PowerDirector 12 Ultimate is for its new MultiCam Designer feature. This great new feature allows you to quickly and easily put together a video using up to four different camera angles/sources. I've already utilized this new feature a couple of times and it's terrific. Awesome new feature. This new feature alone makes upgrading to this new version worth the cost.

Lastly, while all these new improvements are great, what makes this new ""Ultimate"" version a winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. PowerDirector 12 Ultimate is a fantastic set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. It currently has the most bang for your video editing buck.

I've also run both TurboTax and TaxCut during a few years to see if the ""help"" was better in one or the other (when I was trying to figure out how to answer a question).  Plugging numbers into these programs is not hard.  Determining what numbers to plug in can still be hard.

My experience is that the built-in help behind the questions for the Federal forms is usually OK.  In the unusual areas, I am surprised at how weak the help is - it's there, but not deep.  However, the help behind the State forms is not good - it's shallow at best.

The math in these programs is always right (usually... I did find a bug one year that they quickly fixed in an update), but again, the burden is on you the user to determine what numbers to plug in or when to say ""yes"" or ""no"" during the online interview that these take you through.  In many cases, it's not hard.  But in those hard(er) areas, it can take hours researching what is really being asked.  I've found myself downloading IRS forms and instructions most years to figure out at least one question, and I would not say that my tax returns are all that complicated (I don't have a lot of the odd situations to report).

Getting 5 Federal filings with the price of the full package this year was nice, but paying $19.99 to efile a State Form still feels ridiculously too much.  And in some cases, the Forms needed to file an odd-Sate return need to be paper (they aren't all included with TaxCut), so efile does not work in those situations.  I file 3 sets of forms each year (mine and for 2 of my kids) and this year, the cost or complexities with the kids' State forms will mean paper filing for both of their State returns.

I have not contacted H&R Block for help, so I can't comment on the waiting times to get that help or on the depth of help provided over the phone or over chat (however they do it).

But all of this is still a lot easier (and fun? at least it's a challenge to overcome) for the do-it-yourself type person, than the old paper forms or in taking all the papers to their office and paying them to do it (my opinion).","Fed OK, State (WI) is shallow",1238284800,,

While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.

My recommendation is that you save some money and start with this or Deluxe. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns. My guess is that you won't ever have to, however.","Very good tax software, the best of the three I've tried",1454716800,,

Cyberlink PhotoDirector 5 Ultra is new to me and I must say I was immediately impressed by some of the features.

For one thing, Photo Director didn't try to grab and re-catalog every picture file on my hard drive as some other programs do.  It allowed me to select the photos I want to open.

PhotoDirector didn't balk when opening CR2 files (Canon RAW).  With some other packages, I've had to open and convert my RAW files to JPGs in the camera's software before the software would open with them for further editing.  Since that's a non-issue with PhotoDirector it saves a lot of time.

PhotoDirector includes a lot of editing features; some are standard in photo editing packages (Tooth Brush, Eye Blinger), others were new to me (Body Shaping). I found the separation of Skin Smoother and Wrinkle Remover helped with control and produced a less ""plastic"" looking result.  I like the Content Aware Removal and Smart Patch, but these are two areas that are going to require some practice by the user. I also like the Watermark Creator and WaterMark Templates that are included.  If you're a social media user, you can save and upload a photo to Facebook from PhotoDirector. If you're into HDR photography, you can bracket up to 5 shots with PhotoDirector.

Any photo editing software that does this much has a learning curve, especially if you're used to another package.  So, I was also impressed that the PhotoDirector 5 package included a 117 page manual in the box, including a list of hot key shortcuts.  There is also a handy Help link that is both indexed and searchable so you can figure out how to accomplish an effect while you're working.

What I like most about PhotoDirector is that it does some of the things I commonly need with my photo editing, but have been switching between other programs to accomplish - opening and preliminary editing of RAW files with camera software, to basic clean up and editing with PS Elements, to Watermark and Slideshow with Lightroom.  For basic needs, PhotoDirector has simplified my work flow.

Professional photographers will want to go the PhotoShop / Lightroom direction, but PhotoDirector is great for people who want to do simple editing for personal use (family photos, Facebook, etc.).",Simplifies work flow; bridges a gap with other photo editing software,1388361600,,

I will start with the good on this review, because there is not really that much to say. The product installs easily (remember to uninstall any competitor's product before trying the install of McAfee Total Protection, it will remind you if you have forgotten). Configuration is not difficult and the included products are pretty extensive (read the product description above, it has nearly everything you could hope for in protective software). That, however, pretty well sums up the good stuff.

On the flip side, after installing, I found that the boot time on my dual core Centrino system with 4GB memory, increased by minutes over the 10-20 seconds that I had come to expect with Norton 360 installed. I also had trouble registering the product even after multiple manual attempts. Online support was relatively helpless to help me resolve this problem, at least the first line team. I was eventually bumped to the true technical help (after first being advised to call the fee based help line). At this point the registration completed successfully. Throughout the process McAfee Total Protection had been advising me of new products that I might be interested in (remember those popup windows browsers used to display before popup blockers? Yeah, you get the picture). This required another online help session to turn off that setting on McAfee's end (I was informed that this is a user selectable option, but once it is set, the user cannot change the setting, only McAfee can change it).

All in all, after a couple of days, I uninstalled the suite and reinstalled Norton 360. Boot time is back to what I expect and I do not see any unreasonable slowdowns or spurious alerts messages advertising products.

The package notes the Parent's Choice award for version 20 on the back so we still thought we'd be okay.  It says it works for Windows 7 and it did install (although I needed to input my administrator password), but then we got a shock when we started the software.  Instead of getting the menu shown on the box to take a lesson, play games or whatever, our menu said only 'teacher' or 'student'.  Turns out the software was for a classroom.  The password required to set up the 'teacher' option, without which the 'student' option wouldn't work, was said to be in the administrative manual.  Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.

Since the package is opened, I can't take it back to the office supply store where it was purchased and will have to mail the software and receipt to the company (address in 1 pt font which requires a magnifying glass to read) and the refund will take 4 to 6 weeks.  I tried calling the number on the website and got a ridiculous phone menu run around.  After listening to the options and choosing the one that seemed to apply another recording said a representative couldn't help and to interface with the web instead.  Surely I'd just chosen the wrong option and called again choosing the other option, but got the same message.  Why would there even be a phone number to call if they aren't taking calls.  Very annoying.

I can't speak to the software we expected to receive because we didn't get it, but potential buyers should know that if you have a problem, there is no support.  I'm willing to accept a mistake, but having the package say version 21, the disk say version 20 and different and unusable software actually install tells me this company has very poor quality control.  That coupled with no support  is a disaster.  I do not recommend buying this software.

Update: The website does not list the version 21 software as a choice in the technical support area but I tried another type of search and found it.

Here are the specs for the system I am using it on (DIY system)
Intel Core i5-3570K CPU
Intel 180GB SSD
HIS 512MB HD5670 GPU
8GB DDR3-1600 RAM (2 x 4GB)
Lite-On IHBS112 blu-ray burner

The first thing that attracted me to this package was the claim of WMC TV file support. I've used the very excellent VideoRedo in the past but it's twice as much as this whole package. I knew this didn't have automatic commercial detection but if I could at least trim the beginning and end and convert the files to MKVs, I'd be happy. So, the first thing I tried was to load a WTV file and I was able to do that, even a big 11GB file. It took a while to get used to the video editor but I was able to trim the beginning and end of a video. Converting it to MKV however was a different story. While the Video app supports WTV, for some reason the Recode app does not. I was able to get it to load a DVR-MS file (the old kind). Like MKV, DVR-MS is just a container. In this case the stream is MPEG2. I wanted to write out a MKV with MPEG2 so I would not have to convert it but for some reason the option to change the stream from H.264 to MPEG2 is grayed out so it required conversion to change the container.

The next thing I tried was the Blu-ray player. The whole package is half the price of most commercial software blu-ray players so if this worked, it's worth it alone even if nothing else does. I was able to watch a Blu-ray the first time but the second time when I went to play the Blu-ray the move just hung. I had to reboot to get it to work again.

That's about as far as I've gotten. There are three other things I'll want to do at some point I used to always do with Roxio Creator that'll come up as needed:

Crop an MP3 file for using as a ringtone
Burn a DVD with menus
and the new one I want to try is burning videos to a Blu-ray.

I won't be using all the library and organization tools (Nero MediaHome) since I already use Windows Media Center and MediaBrowser 3 for those (if you haven't checked out MediaBrowser3 it's amazing).

So far, I am pretty happy with it. We'll see how it goes with a big movie project. I have quite the backlog of home movies but it's so hard to find the time to edit them and put them onto a disc. New ringtones will probably be first since that's quick. I don't expect any issues there since MP3s are so lightweight.

[Update]
The Blu-ray support in this package is really a hidden gem. Given the price compared to WinDVD, TMT, etc. I wouldn't hesitate to get this if you want a software Blu-ray player. Even recent titles like Gravity and Enders Game worked.

After quite a bit of searching through each of the Nero modules, I was surprised to find the package actually does not include any sound editing tools. It turns out there's a free download from the Nero website for Nero WaveEditor. So, if you're looking for something to edit MP3s, this package doesn't have it.

Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.

Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.

Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time. Yes I can do this with a smart folder but I would like to have option not to since I don't always want to come back to the search later.

You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.

If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos.

The fact that there are so many tools and features can be a bit overwhelming.

As a photographer, I like to use photo editors for more than fixing the photo problemscropping, sharpening, adjusting hue, etc. If you primarily want to adjust your photosfixing them as photos including adding some color enhancements--there are several other very good, much less expensive programs like Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop Elements that do that.

This is a pretty expensive program and I wouldnt get it unless I felt it did something that I couldn't do less expensively elsewhere (or couldn't do at all elsewhere) or unless it made something much easier to do than a less expensive program did.

Painter 2016 doesnt make thing easierthe interface isn't horrible and the tutorials are goodbut it is not all that intuitive and takes a little patience. (I also found some of the Youtube videos helpful). If youve used Photoshop, etc. youll see a lot of the same concepts herethe layout of the workspace, the toolbox, palettes, brushes. You can use layers and adding one is just as easy as clicking New layer.
What I like is taking a photo and using it to make something that is less like a photo and more like a painting (obviously those who start from scratch can use the tools to create a drawing or painting from scratch. The dpi is good.) The cloning tool and tracing features are very useful. It will do underpainting for you automatically. You can choose the texture of your paper and between all the things youd expecta watercolor effect, pastel effect, charcoal, etc. Choosing the right brush is a big thing in Painter, but it isn't that hard to get used to.  In addition to the texture of your paper, you can control the brightness of it and  adjust the texture to customize it for your own needs. It was good for landscapes,  okay for portraits. There are some special effects filters, wood cut, kaleidoscope, glass distortion, and so onnot useful for me, but someone may like it.

If you want to make art, particularly from a photo, this is a good program for it. I found the graphic capabilities able to add the kind of artistic details that made the end product look more like something that had started out as a painting done from scratch rather than a digitally enhanced photo. If you understand what that means and want to do it with your photos (and have the time to do it--it's not like applying a filter, it's like actually making a work of art), you would probably enjoy this very much.

Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.
As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you're really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company. And you get to interact with a killer whale as well! Keep up the good work, Her Interactive!

My wife works for a university, so she was able to get Vista for $25.  I figured I would do a fresh install with a full version Vista ultimate.  At first, my computer ran fine, but day by day it kept getting slower and slower.  I have a fast computer, but at any given time, Vista is using 70% of my 1 gig of memory.  I can run about 2 or 3 programs, but after that, things start crashing.  Sure I could upgrade, but why would I want to spend money to upgrade my hardware to do the same stupid tasks I was doing just fine with XP?  Vista also uses 15 extra gigabytes of hard drive space.  15 Gigabytes can hold about 1000 mp3 files or 50,000 pictures.  The pop ups are annoying too.  This means I get to spend $400 and subtract my hard drive space, upgrade my memory, and deal with annoying pop ups that ask me if I know what I'm doing; for a pretty version of XP, right? How did this company manage to dominate the OS market?

I installed a copy of Ubuntu.  It took 10 minutes to install.  All of my pictures, videos, music, MS Word and Excel files transferred over flawlessly.  With Vista, I could multitask with about 4 programs without crashing.  With Ubuntu, I can have 30 programs running and it still doesn't slow down...with 1 gig of memory!

Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it.  The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window.
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site.  I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached.  During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on ""Download Software"" on the top banner, and select ""State Editions"".  Currently it says ""Available in January 2014"".

When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled ""Buy"" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy"" will turn into ""update"" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Update: To post an answer to a good question asked via a comment:  Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
 Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years.  I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

H.,"Many things can be said about this and competing products, most of them being aimed at editor features and render speed.  I'm going to stick to one subject only because this is where Corel gets it right where nobody else is:  ACTUAL QUALITY OF HD OUTPUT.

If all you want to do is make cute little youtube videos, then any junky editor will do because quality simply does not matter.  But If you want to make BluRays, listen up, Pespecially your PowerDirector fans:

I try every version of PowerDirector (including 12) that comes out, and end up running right back to Corel's VSX.  Why?  because no matter what kind of editing process/features you may enjoy about these two products, what does it all matter if the HD output is garbage?  Are you using this software to enjoy the editing process or are you using it to create good looking content?  Corel produces flawlessly beautifull, crystal clear HD content (I'm talking BluRay production here).  PowerDirector doesn't, and CANT.

Time and time again, no matter how I try with PD's limited controls, I can't get PD's BlueRay output to look good on a 55"" flatscreen.  It's grainy, pixilated, especialyl during pans or action sequences, which pixelate and blur BADLY.  Also, there is no render quality settings to fix this.  If you use PowerDirector, you are STUCK with this.  Corel, even with a bit if a dumbed down interface (but not much), has a boatload of output and quality options that allow you to drill down as far as you want to go to control every aspect of ouput quality and format.  This is really where Corel stomps all over PowerDirector - and always has.

Between these two products, there is only one difference that actually matters:  Output quality.  Everything else is just a bunch of worthless fluff.

The new 64-bit version just means that Corel's VSX is now on the same playing field as PowerDirector speed-wise, and PowerDirector has just lost its only bragging right against VSX.  But Corel has the edge in output options and quality, now making Corel's VideoStudio Pro the superior product.

So much so that I recommended it to my step-father, knowing that I'd be the one installing it on his PCs after he made the purchase on Amazon.

INSTALLATION:

Download went smoothly (as expected) and then it was time to install the software on (5) Windows PCs running XP, Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8 and two running 8.1 as an operating system.  All of the installs went off without a hitch and Webroot SecureAnywhere  is running quietly in the background.

FIRST SCANS:

On the XP PC the first scan snagged several virus'.  This PC had formerly been using AVG Free.

On the Windows 8 PC it had been using AVAST Free, and the first scan with Webroot found a virus.

On the two Windows 8.1 PCs which both had trial versions; one of Norton and one of Kaspersky, no virus' were found upon the initial scan with Webroot.

On the Windows 7 PC no virus' were found.  It had been using Webroot SecureAnywhere 2013; subscription had just run out.

WHY GET THIS SOFTWARE?

1. 'Always on' protection for enhanced internet security on all your devices.
2. No need to mess with it once it's installed.
3. Protects against virus', malware, phishing, identity theft, cybe rcrime, social network threats, and unsafe websites.
4. Warns before you click!
5. Manages passwords for you.
6. 25GB of FREE online storage across your (5) devices is included.
7. Protection on Facebook and Twitter.
8. System analysis to detect system issues.
9. Can wipe history and make deleted files unrecoverable.
10 Automatically scans Android apps and downloads.
11. Can remotely lock and wipe data from smartphones and tablets, and help to locate stolen devices.

I already have Norton installed and purchased this in advance so I chose the 5 device key card. Also, you can try (15 or 30 day trial version) direct from Norton and, if you are happy, you can then get a key card to extend your subscription for an additional 366 days. I say choose the lowest cost to meet your needs.

Second, since I have been using Norton for years, I thought it would be easier just to renew my subscription with a key code. Plus, this one was for 5 devices so I could also include my 2 Android devices. Unfortunately, I encountered a problem with my key code on my second computer where it stated the key code was not for my product. I called Norton where a very courteous representative worked with me over the phone as well as online to complete my renewal subscription. Originally, she told me I would have to download a different version but, in the end, I was able to enter my key code to renew. I had no problem with my third computer.

My first (Lenovo tablet) Android device immediately upgraded (from lite Norton mobile version) to the full version once I signed into my Norton account. My second (Tianle TV stick) Android device did not upgrade where I needed to uninstall Norton for mobile app and re-install it. Once I re-installed the Norton for Mobile devices and signed into my Norton account, it immediately upgraded to full version.

Anyway, overall, I'm sure Norton AntiVirus is (and has been) a good product for internet online security. But, since there are many other good (and free) antivirus choices, I can only rate this product as okay. Also, I didn't like having a problem with my subscription renewal process.

FYI: I recommend including Norton's (free) Identity Safe program for computers and mobile app for Android/Apple devices. This is one of the better password manager interfaces.

This software has a wide range of applications built into a single user interface - not just file compression anymore. I admit that I don't have a pressing need to use zipped files except on rare occasions to attach photos and other documents to emails.  JPEG files are highly compressed already.  The typical reduction for me is about 20% overall.  I compressed several text documents and the compression ranged from as much as 90% down to about 24% depending upon the file I chose.  Compression is very fast - only a few seconds typically.  But I have a very fast CPU running at 4.6 GHz.

Conversion to PDF files takes a little longer, but still very fast. It seemed to take longer than it actually did - still measured in seconds of maybe 10 to 15 seconds depending on the file size and content.

I've somehow managed to get by without compression software for thirty years. Hard disks have very high capacity and are relatively cheap these days.  But now that SSDs are becoming ubiquitous in laptop computers, the need to compress files has returned - along with the need for encryption of very sensitive data that most people have loaded on their laptop computers, especially worrisome when traveling. And this software application package includes encryption.

The price is somewhat high for pure compression software, but since they bundled numerous extra applications, the value is fairly good. The included conversion to PDF documents is very useful.

Works seemed to find non existent problems and used lots of resources. Since Norton Anti-Virus cost just about the same price as Systems works did I opted for one of the free anti-virus programs (Avast) and was very happy. I also have a Mac and use no Norton software on it.

Recently I obtained a new HP Vista computer and was happily running Avast on it with no problems. But I missed several programs I had on my XP system that did things like defrag my hard drive, keep track of my passwords, etc. So when this program became available in the Amazon Vine program and I noticed it had those separate programs that I had by other companies now incorporated all into one program called Norton 360 I decided to give it a try.

I had no problem loading the software and it seemed to configure effortlessly upon it's first start up. I've used all of the features on it thus far except the backup program. I am unclear as if the backup only works to the skimpy on-line disc space that comes with the product (more can be rented for what seems a fairly astronomical price). The features of the program seem to work well so far in all the areas I have tried.

I've read many of the other reviews for this program and it seems I may be praising it too soon since I've only had it installed about 3 weeks so far (on a 6 week old PC) and it seems that things begin to go sour shortly after that - we'll see. I would agree that it seems to work best with new computers with fresh Vista installations (Ultimate version in my case on a 6 week old PC). It seems to incur all sorts of problems on older systems with Vista upgrades.

So I'm taking a cautious approach and think that it's an average program that tries to do a lot, and if you have  the need or desire for these features and a fairly new computer it will probably work well for you. I can't speak for what your experience with older computers would be like.",So far it does the job but it may be too soon to tell,1215648000,3.0,

Yes, you can manage photos but it's not 'effortlessly'. My main problem with most tools that offer to do content 'management' on my behalf is that they claim to know the 'right way' which is usually their own rigid way of imposing 'order' into my private universe and it tends to clash with 'my way'. A tool unable to compromise if not let me keep 'my way' of organizing things becomes an annoyance and the opposite of 'useful' because all it does is slow me down. PhotoDirector's content management model clashes with mine and reconciliation may not be possible or it didn't happen after a few weeks of use. Its insistence of swallowing all my photos into what it calls 'projects' and 'albums' might make sense if you get PhotoDirector the day you start taking digital shots but it's a pain if you already have 5000 or 10,000 photos around, already organized by some other criteria. I expected more flexibility.

Yes, photo processing can be fast but, as always, there is a correlation between speed and quality and touching the program-provided magic wands that should do auto adjustments for the better don't always produce a better photo. In fact, the better your original shot was, the higher the odds are that you get something worse if you try to process it with the auto options. Yes, creative photo editing is possible but you don't get half the tools that, let's say, Photoshop would give you. And there's, of course, the learning curve whenever dealing with an unfamiliar user interface but that can be overcome in time. PhotoDirector is quite Okay as an editing tool, it really is and it's possible to get better and better results as you become more familiar with the tools.

Sadly, the photo editor is tightly integrated with the 'manager' part meaning that if you have no use for the manager, the only way to 'liberate' your contents from PhotoDirector's rigid structure is to grab your work as soon as it's done and move it someplace where your photos are organized the way you want them organized.

Overall, the package is a pretty nice but not 'pro' quality photo editing tool that's too tightly integrated into a photo management scheme I won't accept. Three stars, exclusively on the editor's merits should be a fair rating.","Photo editor, yes. Content manager, no, no, no",1387324800,,

1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.

2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that ""just works"" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.

3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.

4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.

Windows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and ""just works"". Next to the very secure and stable Linux distributions, you can't go wrong with Windows 2000 Professional.","the best version of Windows, bar none",1158969600,8.0,

This is the third of four programs (each offering something more) offered by Norton to protect computers. There is Norton Antivirus, Norton Internet Security, Norton 360 and Norton 360 Multi-Deivice.  Norton 360 Multi-Device allows you to add protection to smart phones and tablets as well as computers. Norton also has a line of mobile and tablet security.

Once you purchase this you get a one year subscription. After the year is up you can either buy another year of service from Norton or buy the product from a third party like Amazon. In my case I was given the opportunity to review this for free through the Vine program so jumped at the chance to do so.

One of the nice features with Norton is that once installed it will always update to the latest version of the software you purchased. As a result of this there is no pressure to try the new and improved version because you are getting the newest version of the software you purchased.

When you press the Norton icon you get a screen that has security, identity, backup and tuneup options.  Each option gives you a number of choices such as when to run scans or updates or how to manage identity protection. It is easy to use and ideal for people who are not computer experts.

Norton Safe Search will also appear when I search the Internet.  There is a search box and if you go through it Norton will let you know if a site is safe or not.

One of the things I like about Norton is there is 24 hour live free technical support available for issues with installation or product use in general. I had an issue this year that may have been virus related and I called technical support. The agent addressed my concern and thankfully it was not a virus issue.

Over the past year I have had a couple of warnings that a virus had been blocked.  I have yet to have a virus problem in the years I have been using Norton products.

When you buy a Norton product you get 365 days of updates to keep your computer protected from the latest spyware and virus threats.  I had four months of my subscription left and a Norton agent was able to add that to the year that came with this product.

When I first started using Norton many years ago I would use additional programs for added protection against spyware. I just use Norton now. I am confident that it will protect my computer from virus or spyware issues. Additionally when scans are running I can still work on my computer without everything slowing down.

Norton's link scanner is a special feature. It not only tests links before you go there, but it also is capable of scanning your social media (like FaceBook) wall for links posted there, to ensure that the links lead to safe places. This is a big plus for people who are active on that social media sites. A useful feature !!

This version comes with a startup manager to help you to disable startup programs that you don't use or that you don't want to start up.

You cannot choose a disk you want to scan in a VirusScan GUI. If you want to scan just a particular volume, a folder or even a file, you can right-click on it in window explorer and choose the Scan option from the Norton sub-menu.

If there is any particular weakness in Norton360, it's the ""Backup"" feature which is very basic. And the 2GB free backup space is nearly useless. This is not a replacement for more capable backup utilities like Acronis TrueImage, or the Norton Ghost.

If Smart Surfing was less expensive (and didn't bring my browsers to a halt), I might like having it as a safety net. But at this price, it just didn't measure up.

In fairness, I'll say that some of the protective features are probably useful for people who are inexperienced on the web, or who share their computers with inexperienced people. Additionally, the ability to block entire catagories of websites (like adult sites) could be useful for families with kids using the computer.","Freezing My Browsers Isn't ""Smart""",1245888000,2.0,

Previously I used Kaspersky Security Suite and I didn't like it mostly because of the annoying firewall. As an antivirus I was always happy with it.

This package includes only the antivirus and is pretty solid. It installs without problems and it works. If you are worried about having on the CD an earlier version (build) that might have installation issues, you can always download the latest from Kaspersky and activate it with the serial number provided.

Kaspersky is a well-known name in the security software community and it always has one of the top places when somebody does a test on multiple security suites or antivirus programs.

The load on the system is not slowing it down, at least not on my machine, but maybe on older computers it could be a problem.

The only issue I have with this software is again the Kaspersky firewall. Since the firewall is not part of this package it is indirectly affecting it. Like most users, I would like to have a security suite rather than individual products made by different software vendors. In this case, I cannot have the anti-virus without having the Kaspersky firewall, therefore, no matter how good the antivirus I will not use that in combination with say Norton Firewall. This makes this product of limited value for me and I will probably not buy it by itself.

My husband and I were both impressed with what the program said it could do. It sounded too good to be true. We installed it on two desktop PCs and one laptop.

All the computers were slowed down to a snail's pace. Starting up the computer took at least three minutes (and seemed like a lifetime). Opening each program took so long, minutes to open an application!  Opening my (popular) email application and waiting for the download to happen took forever. The process by which it scans each email for viruses apparently takes a lot of time. To cope I'd end up opening the program, walking away and returning later to read the email.

Even using the computer doing simple tasks like changing to view the email program to use a word processing program was very difficult. I'd click on the other application and it would pause and nothing would move, then a minute or two later the screen would finally react. Flipping from one Internet browser to another would have long pauses and it `wouldn't go'.  Before installing this program I could flip to different Internet browser windows with immediate results. Trying to open new programs such as a spreadsheet program took forever and the cursor didn't seem to react, so I'd click on the icon again. In the end sometimes I'd end up with three of the programs open and ready to run.

I had the worst experience with using a (popular) photo altering program. That program kept locking up.

The long time that it took to access different programs and to switch from viewing the Internet to the word processor made the most basic computer work painstaking and time consuming. It was ridiculous. I have not experienced a computer being this way since the early 1990s when I was accessing the Internet through dial-up! To cope with the computer being this way, I took to reading something on paper while I waited for the system to catch up so I could do whatever it was that I was trying to do.

Also when starting up the system each day I'd get an urgent message that there was a problem! Guess what `the problem'  was? I had new documents that needed backing up. Give me a break--that is no urgent or emergency situation.

We were so happy to uninstall this from all of our computers. Now are computers are back to normal.

We did spend quite a lot of time installing this program and then uninstalling it. What a waste of time this was. I can't believe how poor this program is, I'm really surprised.

They historically have been ranked pretty high for great intervention and also for efficient use of space and RAM. Androids are getting to the point where they are the PC of the Smartphone industry: open source, ubiquitous, and vulnerable. So we need to have a strong security suite on our phones and tablets. But which one is still up in the air. The good news with most (including this one)? You can try it first.

If you download the Kaspersky app from the Amazon App Store or Play or direct link (usa.kaspersky .com/dl/mobile) you'll get a fully functional preview with a firewall. You can also select to try the full suite (this product) for 30 days for free. And you should.

It includes all the functionality that you may be used to with well known products (like one of my favorites Lookout Mobile Security) but also includes some stuff that those products usually dont.

Included:
+Antivirus, antispam, antispyware
+webpage blocking, phishing link alerts, (and really cool) antiphishing in texts (this is something we don't think of much but is a huge driver for exploit. We get a link in a text and don't worry too much about clicking it. That's an error. This app is supposed to stop that link.)
+High performance, low impact to data/ram/battery (I can tell you I had it running for an hour on a Galaxy S3 and checked battery usage and it wasn't even on the page of top users. The page ended at 2% so this app didn't even use 2% of the battery after an hour. That's pretty good. You will have to download an update the first time and it make bounce usage up to about 40 MB.)
+Anti-theft location, block, erase, mugshot (this is very similar to a host of other resources like Lookout, AVG, Norton, etc where you can remotely track your device using GPS, take pics of your thief through the front facing camera, and lock/ wipe your phone and CD card and even if your thief has changed SIMs which is a nice feature. Don't get too caught up on the GPS location as it isn't always acurate and you shouldn't go knocking on doors of unsavory people anyway. Just tell your local police department. I've used this to find phones that were misplaced. Once I found a phone that was in my home by locating it near my home on the map - so I knew it wasn't where I had just been. Another time I located it at a school so checked the field where we just were. Not exact but helps.)
+Call and text filtering (this is nice and brings Android in to the same level of control as iOS and Windows Phone 8 so you can block on a per call/ text basis)
+Privacy protection (I haven't used this yet. I guess if you have an unlocked phone and don't want people to see some stuff you can hide apps/ info if you hand the phone to them. I lock my phone so it's not necessary.)

Overall, this is an impressive program. I really love how little it is using in the background (both data and battery).

The biggest changes for me is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.

Norton Security Premium comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

The cloud backup is something use for non-sensitive information only as backup. The identity protection and contact sharing is interesting but are not features I choose to use.

Buying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.

Windows Setup (UPDATED):
If you are using this to try to renew, DON'T follow the directions to activate the product at norton.com/setup. Instead login to your control panel and select renew. Select the option that lets you enter a key you already have (this one). Enter the key and if it is compatible with the version you are renewing this key will supersede the expiring key. One caution: wait till the old one is about to expire before plugging in the key so you don't lose your remaining subscription!

IF you followed the activation directions this will be installed as a separate product subscription and you will need to do the following:

**NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you may need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices).

Installation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Premium very easily and without problems. I registered the product in my existing Norton account to activate 10 devices I could install. The download went smoothly and installation on my Windows 7 desktop was faster than with older CD based Norton products and similar to Norton Security with Backup. I did have to restart my computer.

I found it interesting that the installation branding and the control panel branding is still Norton Security with Backup reinforcing my perception of a simple evolution and mostly branding changes.

The controls in the GUI are simple and clear coming from Norton Security with Backup.  There are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. There is a small gear icon for settings on the main screen of the GUI and many controls are hidden in there.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is continues to be ""noisy"" than pre-2015 versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. It has the same light impact on PC performance as the previous version.  This is a very good thing! The initial full scan came up clean which is no surprise ince I had last year's version installed before this one.

Application Compatibility Problems:

Unlike last year's version I have had no application compatibility problems. Last year's version has issues with VirtualBox. Good news!

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is better than before, but not all that much. It has two features: anti-theft and cloud backup. It does not include any virus protection. The Anti-Theft features include:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 6 a quarter mile away!! Also letting it run GPS in the background significantly reduced my battery life.
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number. If the phone is locked it can't be answered...
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

It has cloud backup (doesn't Apple offer this too?) to backup your contacts and share them.

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:
If you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed and want this to be a renewal, DON'T FOLLOW THE ACTIVATION DIRECTIONS!

If you have gone through norton.com/setup, be sure to remove your device from the Norton control panel and device before installing the new version. I could not find a way to move a device from an old subscription to a new one unless I renewed through the Norton site at a higher price. That's annoying

Because it's a great product for home users, having to reinstall if you buy a new subscription (vs renewing) and the IOS app remains quite limited I'm giving Norton Security Premium 4 stars.

While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.

Being a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:

Story: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.

Graphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.

Characters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.

Puzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.

Activities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.

Ending: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.

Total (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....

But not much else has changed since the 2013 version. But it is still BOSS over the Sage 50 Complete Accounting 2014 software with more features, but you would think with Sage getting raked over the coals from the 2013 version about removing the Payroll Processing / Tax features and making them a completely seperate add-on, that they would have heard the cries of foul. Not so! They are definitely sticking to their guns on this one. Given a few years down the line, nobody will even remember that they were once a singular product under Peachtree. Also, in order to create and report on payroll checks in your Sage 50 accounting solution, you are required to get a Sage Business Care Gold or Platinum subscription.

Although you are getting a wonderful accounting and inventory software, they are continually throwing additional add-ons and sales pitches to buy even more of their products. It's pretty annoying after a bit.

One of the catches with this software is that it is auto-renewing. So in order to activate this software, your going to have to give them your credit card number in order to get started. Personally, I feel this is an over-the-top lock-in, so to say. They should be more like your anti-virus subscription, letting you know that your subscription is about to expire, giving YOU the option of renewing instead of them just automatically renewing.

So if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage. So you better know right off the bat if you are ready to make a true commitment to using Sage 50 Accounting software, because that is truly what it is... a commitment!

As I stated before in my 2013 version review, if you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget and can absolutely commit to using this software. However, if you do not need the the Payroll & Tax software, then this is indeed a wonderful and premium accounting and inventory software.",A Great Accounting & Inventory Software,1375574400,,

Those who are ripping this software as 'terrible' or 'unusable' as being overly harsh. Does it have some frustrating issues? Sure. Is it worthless and unusable? Not at all.

Word, which is the application I spent about half my work hours using, is in many cases easier to use in the 2007 version. While I'm not a huge fan of the ribbon, I don't have issues locating what I need nor do I have problems customizing it to include the features I use most often. Overall I can find exactly what I need when I need it. I think most of the complaints that I read about the ribbon have more to do with users unable to adapt than with a real design flaw inherent to the system of organization. The new DocX file format creates smaller file sizes than the old standard, but at the expense of versatility, as un-patched versions of Microsoft Word will not open them.

Excel is fantastic. The 2007 version is impressively fast compared to 2003. I can use tilt tables with 200 variables without a second delay. Also, the ability to create very high quality charts and graphs that seamlessly integrate with Power Point and Word is fantastic. I've been able to make nicer looking reports in less time than ever before. Excel is the biggest overall improvement from 2003 especially in the visual department. The addition of a wide variety of visual styles for reports is welcome and very useful.

Another great change to Excel is the detailed descriptions for each command that are available in the help section. There is still some streamlining that is missing; too much of the program is still dependent on old macro commands that no one but long time users of things like Lotus Notes have a vocabulary for.

Power Point is also a nice improvement. Adding images and then tweaking them is easier than ever. As I mentioned previously, taking charts and graphs from Excel to PP is very easy. You can use cut-and-paste, or import them directly. The resulting PP files are also smaller than the previous format, which is great for e-mailing them to people.

The much maligned DocX format was initially a real gaffe for Microsoft; not making it immediately usable by Office 2003 users was simply moronic. Although they've released several patches that do allow full implementation between 2003 and 2007 versions of Office, these updates are large (over 50mb) and while businesses most certainly have updated, it's far less likely that your friend, brother, etc., has. Sending a DocX file to those without the patch can create a bit of chaos.

Overall Office 2007 is an improvement over 2003, even if you hate the ribbon. The speed increases, added features, and integration of excel, word, and PP in a way that lets them all play together nicely is well worth the upgrade.",Better than negative reviews would have you believe,1235433600,2.0,

- Stability is poor.  The system frequently blue screens (crashes) or, more commonly, hangs.  It's not a hardware problem, because both systems experienced these issues, and neither system has any issues running XP.  Vista Media Center slowly degrades over time (one of the computers is my living room DVR) until it is unusable without a hourly reboot (seriously!)
- Speed - I play a lot of games, and Vista is consistently and significantly slower on every single game I've tried.  The difference is significant, even WITH the very latest ""Vista Certified"" video and sound drivers.  Then, there are games that crash on Vista, but have no issues on XP.  You can say ""Well, they were tested to work with XP"", and you'd be right, but I'd rather be running an OS that games were tested with.  And the DirectX 10 effects, which only Vista supports, are very ho-hum - they're not worth the performance hit, in my opinion.  For an example, check out the Crysis DirectX 9 vs. DirectX 10 comparisons on the net.
- Hardware support - this really is not Microsoft's fault, but it is still an issue.  Many hardware manufacturers quietly refusing to release drivers for their existing hardware, in an effort to force people to buy new hardware for Vista support.  That's totally not Microsoft's fault - but make sure your devices are Vista compatible, BEFORE you buy Vista.  Microsoft has a  good compatibility guide on their website for this.  Scanners, printers, music players, phones, and wireless network gear are the gadgets with the worst Vista driver support, as are notebooks not specifically ""designed for Vista"".

I'm not saying you should NOT buy Vista, but if you do, be prepared for the problems you will encounter.  It might be better for a business user who is buying all new Vista compatible hardware.","Stability, speed, hardware support are poor",1218240000,3.0,

This review will highlight some of the features of the WordPerfect Office Suite.

WordPerfect
-----------
- QuickCorrect
QuickCorrect (called AutoCorrect in Word) is a pretty standard feature in word processors nowadays but a feature unique to WordPerfect is SpeedLinks. SpeedLinks allows you to specify a ""Link Word"" (e.g. @Amazon) and a corresponding Web address to link to (e.g. Amazon's Web address). Every time you type in @Amazon, the ""@Amazon"" will be replaced with Amazon's Web address.

- Multiple File Formats Supported
You can convert a WordPerfect file into Microsoft Word and other word processor formats such as WordStar, XyWrite, and DisplayWrite. If your document contains tables, you have to the option of converting the document into MS Excel, OfficeWriter, QuattroPro, and Lotus 123 as well.

- Frustration-Free
I used Word for many years before I gave up on it almost entirely. I usually elect instead to create my documents in a plain text editor like Editplus, copy and paste it in Word, and ten add on the finishing touches, such as underlining, italics, and bold (which a plain text editor cannot do). The reason: formatting quirks (e.g. line spacing, indentation) in Microsoft Word can be absolutely exasperating! If you use Word on a regular basis, *you know* what I'm talking about.

Word processing not only works flawlessly in WordPerfect, it is incredibly easy to incorporate, format, and manipulate tables, pictures, and multimedia. I can concentrate on creating content without having to contend with software quirks.

Quattro Pro
-----------
Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program like Excel. However, There is a disadvantage of using Quattro Pro. Since the vast majority of people use Excel rather than Quattro Pro or any other spreadsheet programs, help resources are not as abundant as Excel. This will almost definitely not be an issue if you're using Quattro Pro for designing simple spreadsheet but it may be a concern if you're planning on designing more complex spreadsheets that involve more advanced features such as macros.

Quattro Pro is also incompatible with Excel. You cannot expect to easily migrate an Excel file in Quattro Pro and vice versa. If you're newbie on spreadsheet, my advice: go with Excel.

Presentations X5
----------------
Presentations X5 works a lot like Microsoft Powerpoint. You can easily create presentation slide shows. Presentations X5 allows you to insert pictures, sounds, spreadsheets, multimedia files (such as MPEG, AVI), and other objects.

Extras
------
- Create PDF's
New in X5 is a PDF Tool which allows you to turn any WordPerfect document into a PDF file. It can even convert image-based PDF files into editable content! Use it to add comments or mark up your PDF files. PDF files can be password-protected.

You can create high-resolution or low-resolution PDF's (high-resolution PDF's are best suited for printing and low-resolution PDF's are best suited for posting on the Web.) Note: PDF Tool is only available in the Standard and Professional versions of the WordPerfect Suite.

---
WordPerfect Office X5's forte is in its word processing program, WordPerfect. (Any wonder why Corel named its office suite after its word processing program?) I am very impressed by how easy it is to create and edit content in WordPerfect. Presentations X5 is a superb program as well. As for Quattro Pro, I do have slight reservations about recommending it to someone who uses its more advanced features, not because of any flaws inherent in the program, but because help resources are relatively scanty compared to Excel. All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the WordPerfect Office suite. The bottom line: if you need a word processing program and have only rudimentary spreadsheet needs, the WordPerfect Office X5 suite is definitely the way to go.",Finally -- Frustration-Free Word Processing,1280361600,6.0,

It has many more features and included add-ins than I'll ever need. For example - multi-camera features are cool but I doubt I'll ever use more than 2 cameras. Still it's nice to have the option. The same for a lot of the other advanced capabilities. Motion follow is already a very useful for me.

The program comes with a limited time access to on-line training. I have only dipped my figurative toe into these lessons but I think most new video editors will find the training a very helpful quick start and introduction to video editing using Pinnacle Studio. I think this is a thoughtful plus, but the time-limited access is just plain strange. Happily there are lots of helpful youtube videos too.

Somehow it bugs me when a program has a shopping cart built-in. It's like you are expected to get add-ons to really use the program. For example, a major feature is 4K and HD editing. Does it make sense that Blu-Ray burning should be an extra cost $7.99 add-on you can only purchase through the program? Probably this does not push other folks buttons like it does mine.

Here is what I like:
+ Easy to use interface (coming from Adobe Premiere)
+ Limited-time access to online training is useful
+ Performs well with reasonably quick user interface
+ Reads/writes every format I could want
+ Motion follow for text has been very handy!
+ A large number of transitions and effects are included
+ Tracking effects (like blur and following text) are helpful

Here is what I don't so much:
- Blu-Ray burning requires a $7.99 add-in

I like when software gets regular updates. I installed the latest patch today:  V20.1.0 released 2016-10-26. Here is a summary  of its changes:
* Resolved black or flickering preview
* NewBlueFX: Watermarks removed
* Resolved error messages that displayed when editing titles
* Resolved crashes in Slideshow projects
* Sample project is now removable
* New! Added audio-specific fade transition (Audio Cross Fade)

In conclusion, I think Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate is a very nice video editing package at an affordable price point. It is feature rich with a very usable interface. It seems intuitive to me after using Adobe Premiere. Performance seems pretty good to me on my desktop with lots of RAM. It bugs me that an add-on is required to burn a Blu-ray and the program has a built-in shopping cart.

The annoyances are minor compared to the overall value of the program. Amazon does not give half stars and I don't think that I can really take a full star off so 5 stars is my rating.

I loaded it on my Windows 8 laptop with a touchscreen fairly quickly and easily. Then opened the program. It's very friendly, with a nice interface that's easy to understand if you've ever used any kind of graphics program before. The photo editing tools are beautifully done.

Until Microsoft decides to natively decode blue ray through Windows Media Center (or whatever replaces it in Windows 8), you need a separate piece of software like this one.

For reference, I have an HTPC with a dual core 2.4ghz processor, 8gb of ram, and a blue-ray player connected to my plat panel TV.

PowerDVD is par for the course these days--sloppy, poorly coded garbage full of unnecessary bloat, with no option to install only the components you want or need. It reminds me of the way NERO went from a streamlined, easy to use program to a boat-fest resource hog. I also dislike how (as other reviewers noted) PowerDVD installs services that work in the background, sending your private data to corporations. Unless you manually stop them, they will track everything you watch and send that data off to marketing companies.

I didn't have any issues installing the software. Things went smoothly, and I was able to easily play a DVD. However, I elected NOT to keep this software on my computer, largely because a much easier solution exists for me. (I don't need it to play anything but Blue-Rays; I use XBMC for playing all my other media). An easy, frustration free way to play Blue Rays is with VLC (a free, excellent media player). Just use it to make .MKV files from each Blue Ray disk and then play them with VLC. For complete instructions, check the comments section of this review.

Basically, this is an overpriced, largely problematic software that you don't really need unless you just have to play Blue-Rays and don't want to mess around with VLC to rip them to .MKV files. I don't see a benefit to buying it unless you are willing to put up with frustration, turn off services sending away your private data, and don't have another option for a media suite.",Plays Blue Rays | Bloated | Ultimately not worth the price,1339632000,,

My last version of this software was version X3, and I certainly did find this version to be quite a bit faster, and the user interface to be quite a bit better. This latest version boasts several performance improvements over previous versions, and it also has an even longer list of editing tools. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is an efficient and comprehensive video editing program that has more than enough features and video editing capabilities for the average user.

One reason I got this new version is because it allows me to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. But the main reason I got this new version is for the 64-bit high-end Special FX Pack, the really great slideshow maker, and the much faster video rendering. This software is designed to take advantage of more computing power if your computer has it available. My computer does in fact have quite a bit of muscle, and I did find this version of this software to be faster. It's certainly not ""WOW"" faster, but quite noticeably faster. However, if your computer is lacking in the muscle department, you likely won't notice much of a difference in rendering speeds, so do take that into account.

Something else I wanted to mention is that I own several other video editing programs, and while their specs are the same as Corel's, for some reason Corel's rendered output just plain looks better. I don't know why, but it does. And not just a little bit better either. It's significantly better. After you finish your project, what you see onscreen is significantly clearer and smoother. This, of course, isn't a minor thing, this is a major thing, and this tells me that Corel's software is definitely doing something differently, something much better than what their competitor's software is doing. So, while there are other video editing programs that certainly have more bells and whistles than Corel's, if the quality of the finished product is the most important thing to you, do take Corel's top quality output into account.

Now, like I said, my last version of the software was version X3, and while all the improvements to this latest version are really terrific, what makes this newest version a real winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is a great set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. You get a lot of bang for your video editing buck. It contains all the tools you need to make really great videos. I recommend this latest version highly. I hope you found this review helpful.",All The Tools You Need To Make Great Videos,1399161600,,

Because I bought the 2011 version to update 2007, but the 2011 version makes mistakes in calculating a budget, so Intuit's solution was to ""allow"" me to revert to a 2010 version, which they supplied. They said they'd contact me when the problem was fixed so I could go back to the version I paid for, but they never contacted me; now I know why. They moved the faulty 2011 engine to 2012! If I had paid for this 2012 version, I'd be returning it.

It's tough to trust Intuit with budget and money tracking. I have a 2010 version that calculates properly so I will stick with that even though there are other problems I've had to work around. I hope that someday Intuit will change management and once again create new and innovative products that function well. Here is what I found so far:

Pros
*Automatically updated via Internet during installation from CD.
*Kept my interface and report customizations.
*Runs faster than 2010.
*Lots of great tools and features that do function properly.
*60-day money back guarantee.

Cons
*Installer required uninstalling 2010 version. Makes it tough to compare two versions or revert to previous version.
*Automatic update took 15 minutes on a 2.8 GHz computer with broadband connection. Hmmm!
*My old file had to be converted to the new format. Good thing I kept a backup.
*Requires Windows. PC version has multiple problems but Mac version sucks banshee farts.
*Budgeting tool still has calculation problems that originated in the 2011 version. If a money program cannot calculate accurately, what good is it?
*Transaction download issues still abound. Intuit usually blames their server, the bank's server, or recommends deleting the connection and re-establishing it (a lengthy, somewhat complex process).
*Still has trouble dealing with time and suggests restarting the program to fix it.
*Auto-fill is still a nightmare.
*Support is still lame. They may answer the phone better (sometimes) but the solutions they provide do not fix the problem, they tell you how to work around the problem. They have been doing this for years!!!

UPDATE Jan 2013

Intuit has just notified me that they will no longer support 2010 as of April 2013. No more downloading transactions. No more customer ""support."" Not that support was ever really there, but no more downloading transactions? They already have numerous problems with downloading so I must download a file from my bank and import it into Quicken, but two of my accounts work OK. So they are pushing me from a version that calculates properly to one that doesn't. And I've heard nothing good about the 2013 version.

Poor service and support never ends with Intuit, so expect this to happen in a couple of years for the 2012 version, so I dropped the rating to one star.

If you don't think the M&M thing is funny for any reason, give this a pass. Not everyone has to see and like every movie.

Personally, I thought the special effects were very good, except for those that were intentionally cheesy to match the TV show, in good fun.

The desert scenes were a real treat, with various objects from Earth (and elsewhere) sticking up out of the sand in various spots. I had a lot of fun just trying to spot all the odd objects scattered about those scenes.

The characters have different relationships than the old show. Holly is ""all grown up"", and very pleasingly so.

Based on the high quality offering of the ""German Level 1, 2, 3"" set, that reputation appears to be well deserved.  The package is far more than just a book on German in digital form, and includes many extra features to make the whole thing worth the hefty price tag.

The three level German language software comes with a USB headset so that the user can listen to the lessons without disturbing anyone around them.  The headset has a built-in microphone that works with the software's speech recognition feature, which lets the user know how they are doing with the language.  A quick-start fold out card is also included, complete with pictures and step-by-step instructions, to get the user started quickly.

The software isn't hard to install, but it is a very long process.  The entire installation could take more than a half hour, especially if the massive web updates are downloaded.  Any decent computer system should be able to handle the software, as the program only requires 512 MB of RAM and 1.8 GB of hard drive space.  Both Windows XP and Windows Vista are currently supported.  There is an interesting option that can be set during the installation to change the software to start with a different language.  The program doesn't have to go from English to German, but can instead begin with several different starting languages.  That alone already makes it more versatile than any German language book could ever be.

Another neat add-on that is included is a set of stickers that can be attached to a keyboard.  The stickers mimic a German language keyboard, which will make typing in German easier once the basics of the language have been mastered.  The user's guide is also exceedingly comprehensive, so any questions about how to use the software shouldn't require a call to tech support.

Once the program is installed and started there are several different course options to choose from.  Each option tackles a different aspect of learning the language, such as reading, writing, and speaking.  The default option is to learn all three at once, but for those who don't have enough time for the full course or are only interested in one of the courses there is the option to remove one or two of the features.
As the name suggests there are three levels to the software, each building on the concepts in the last.  As the user progresses through the program they switch out the CDs to the next level.  The program also comes with multiple audio companion CDs so that the user can practice their German when they aren't in front of their computer.

While the price may be a big deterrent for some, there is enough high quality material in the Rosetta Stone German language software that anyone who is really committed to learning the language should seriously consider it as an option.",Comprehensive and packed with extra features,1248825600,,

No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing).

Three comments about this events:
(1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues.
(2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count).
(3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me.

And, I'm happy to report, it worked great.

I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages.

After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand.

I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment.

No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined.

I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it.

However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit).

So I obviously recommend getting the newer edition for the same. But I have not tested X5, so here are my comments on X4:

I have always loved WordPerfect, and as expected I love X4. For almost 2 decades now, WordPerfect has earned a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and in my opinion it's much better than Microsoft Word or putting together a quick Word document.

I also strongly recommend Open Office, an open source, completely free office suite. I've used Open Office almost exclusively for the past 5 years, and it's great for ""light"" word processing, and it's spreadsheet is more than adequate. However, if you are a heavy user, need templates like label templates (Open Office is not great at this), or need somewhat sophisticated word processing functions (like image integration), WordPefect is hands-down the best in my opinion.

Additionally, WordPerfect opens any PDF into Word Perfect. It saves in just about any format (including .docx). Others have touted the optical character recognition (OCR) feature, which can convert a scan to text. This in itself is actually not a big deal - almost every scanner has bundled software that can do this. But having it build into the word processor means you can take a JPG image (such as a scanned receipt) & convert it back into text.

If you already have X4, I doubt that I would actually recommend upgrading to X5 - I don't plan on it. But if you're looking for a new word processor, I would suggest checking out X5. As for X4, I give it an easy 5-stars.",Great ... but already outdated. X5 is available for the same price,1306281600,,

As a user of Paint Shop Pro since version 4.14 in the 1990s, I have long endorsed PSP as a great, alternative program to Photoshop for graphic artists on a budget. As of this version, I can no longer endorse this product.

Words cannot express how much I hate Paint Shop Pro X4. As I stare into the screen with multiple confusing tabs and screen-hogging image indexes, please know that only one thing remains certain: that I hate PSPX4 with every tired muscle in my graphic artist body. Until X3, the changes they made were minimal, and contributed to more and advanced features.

However, Corel has now ruined it by trying to simplify it for amateur photographers when they should be developing it for professional artists. It's impossible to tell if this is meant for photographers, graphic artists, scrapbookers or for coloring books. It's like all these multi-function ""smart"" devices-- they do a lot of things, but they don't do anything really well, and you have to become an expert on the device to get anything out of it. PSPX4 tries to be all things to all people and fails miserably.

Corel is also trying to pull one over by claiming to have new features that have been available in the program for years. Moving a feature around and calling attention to it does not make it new--it makes the company irritating, as well as making the program difficult to for long time users to find, and difficult for new users to learn in the first place. What was once a contender to compete against the mighty Photoshop is now a glorified app for removing red eye and endless tabs and indexes. X4 is finally showing the strain of executive meddling and has jumped the shark. I have spent more hours than I care to count trying to make X4 functional and have only emerged frustrated beyond all reason.

I would advise others to stick with X3 as well as earlier versions. If you must try this program, download the demo before making a financial commitment. Better yet, I would recommend users invest their time, money and effort in Photoshop, since Corel shows no interest in making a better graphics program and only wants to make a buck from an uninformed amateur photography base.

I will not stop using Photoshop until Corel comes to its senses and stops trying to overtake the plumbing. As it is, with PSPX4 it's too easy to stop up the drain. I have never given any version of PSP a bad review, which makes me hate PSPX4 that much more. PSPX4 is ultimately penny wise and pound foolish, but mostly I won't use it because I hate it so very, very much.

Years back, when it was owned by different companies, I switched over entirely to Microsoft Word and used WordPerfect only when a project demanded it  a situation that became never. Lately Ive also been growing fond of another word processing program called Scrivener which has many advantages for writers.

 My focus here will be n the word processing component, the eponymous WordPerfect, once the king of word processing.

 Corel has done a good job of rescuing this program,. It has lots of neat features that you will not find in Microsoft Word.

 I was particularly drawn to ePublisher, which facilitates the production of ebooks in MOBI and EPUB formats. This is a template rather than an integrated part of WordPerfect and for basic publishing tasks is easy-to-use and works well.

 WordPerfect also has substantial PDF editing and creation tools, which are very impressive.

 The integral Help file is excellent. The User Interface is streamlined and cleaner in some ways than Words.

 File format compatibility isn't very important to most these days, but WordPerfect can deal with more than 60 file formats in one way or another.

I've used various versions of Office for Windows, OpenOffice.org, and Office 2004/2008 for Mac, as well as iWork 06 and iWork 08. I prefer iWork 08 the best, and while Office 2008 is pretty nice, there are some issues I have with it which keep it from being my product of choice.

*Performance: Office programs typically take a few seconds longer to open than iWork programs do. It takes up more ram and makes the whole computer run more slowly than an iWork program does.

*Cost: What is Microsoft thinking? Charging hundreds of dollars for productivity programs (depending on the version), when OpenOffice.org (however ugly-looking and special-feature-lacking it is) is free, and when iWork, a superior product, is well under a hundred dollars.

*Size: The size of all the programs and files in Office 2008 Home & Student is over 900 mb, bigger than it needs to be. iWork+iCal+Mail is less than 700 mb. And Office also has tons of visible files in the Office folder, all of which are executable and pose potential security risks.

*Compatibility: Here's a funny one. I opened a Word document I made in Office 2003 (for Windows, .doc format) in both Pages (from iWork) and Word (from Office). The formatting (paragraph size, margins, etc.) was nearly identical to the original when viewed in Pages, but when viewed in Word 2008, formatting was different! This isn't always the case, though. There was a document I made in Office 2007 (.docx) and formatting was closer to the original when viewed in Office 2008 than when viewed in Pages. But still, Microsoft made Office 2003 and Office 2008, and you'd think they would know how to keep formatting the same better than Apple.

*A bad copy. True to Microsoft's past, they just copied features found in iWork 08 and mushed them into Office 2008, only they didn't do a good job. Like 3D slide transitions really look 3D in Keynote, but they are almost a joke in Office. Or the thing in PowerPoint to help position graphics: it doesn't work with as many items as it does in Keynote. Or controlling PowerPoint with the Apple Remote doesn't work as well, and you can't start a presentation with the remote either.

*Not intuitive. Toolbars are a thing of the past, and you have to keep a side window open for formatting and such. However, if you're viewing the formatting for, say, a chart, you will have no access to basic font formatting at that time.","Pretty features, bad product. I would use iWork instead",1201737600,5.0,

She's currently taking Pre-Algebra in 6th grade and I wanted to give her a leg-up by offering a supplement at home that was not her textbook.

After playing with the software myself these are my impressions.

INTERFACE: How it Looks

This program is not overly appealing visually, but it's not terrible either. If you have the sound on, the voices (several are used depending upon where you are in the program) are a bit boring. Can anyone really fix that one though?  In parts of the program the makers use a space-age theme; in the Algebra Booster for example, there is a math game designed to help kids think algebraically while doing a Pac-Man type game. I played it and found it to be 'OK'.  My 11 year old wasn't overly impressed, but I think she was expecting it to play like her other video games. Bottom line: It really looks like something from 1999 versus 2009.

CONTENT:  What's on the DVD?

For each of the math subjects: Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I... through Calculus and Statistics, there are tabs at the top of the screen.

 ""Lessons"" has subcatagories of 'Basics' and 'Chapters'.  This is basically like a textbook or reference book that you can read when you need it.  Another tab, ""Challenge"" is a problem that in the end asks you questions, but I didn't find an answer to the question... just more questions.  I guess it's designed to help students think a bit deeper.  The third tab is ""Exercises"", which as you would imagine has questions relating to whatever subject inside a math type you are studying.  If you get the wrong answer, it tells you you're wrong, but since they are multiple choice, you never get an explanation, you just get to choose again.  You can view your score and get a report on which ones you got right and wrong to review.  ""Real Life"" is a story problem.  Using the current skill set to solve an every-day issue.  ""Animation"" is a short video illustrating the current skill. It's the company's attempt to 'cartoon up' the software. For visual learners this will be helpful, but the few I viewed were kind of stupid.

The DVD also has bonus applications:  Runes of Avalon and Calculus Ipod material.  I couldn't get the link for the ipod material to open on my computer despite having iTunes and an Ipod Touch, but the game, Runes of Avalon, did install and I played it. It's more a spacial recognition game versus a math game, but it looks good (better than the rest of the software) and the gameplay was smooth.

A strange addition to the package was a CD with animal screensavers on it. The animals look like they are licking your monitor clean. Cute, but seemed like it fell into the wrong box!

CONCLUSION: Would I buy it again? Was it what I was looking for in math-help software?

I got a heck of a deal on this one - under 10 dollars when the local warehouse store was still selling it for over thirty. If I'd paid more, I probably would be a bit irked, but for the money paid... I'm happy. I would buy it again and recommend it as a 'reference' source.

As for whether it was what I was looking for... yes and no. I expected explanations of the subjects listed. I got that and examples, just like a textbook would offer. What I didn't get was the ability to print off worksheets and answer sheets for practice. That would have been great! I found a few places online with free worksheets and some paid sites, but I had hopes that this would offer this and it didn't. Some more games would have been great too, as would the ability of the software to give feedback on a step-by-step basis, versus simply 'wrong' and then you figure it out.

This is a good math resource for any math students seeking a supplement to their current textbook, but it is not software that's filled with useful games and printable worksheets. I found the Cliff notes books (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Algebra-I-Cliffs-Quick-Review/dp/076456370X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Algebra I (Cliffs Quick Review)</a>&nbsp;to be just as helpful, but I couldn't put them on my computer and it would be much more expensive to get them all versus this dvd.","Adequate reference source, but could be better",1261008000,3.0,

So when Apple offered to let me play with a review copy of Office for Mac I thought it would be fun to see how it compares to Office on Windows.

The Mac version provides good compatibility and pretty much the same functionality as the Windows version, and manages to do it in a Mac-style that won't have you always feeling like you're running a Windows app.

As a few seconds reading these reviews will tell you, Microsoft was unable to provide Visual Basic for Applications support in this version, so if you're on an older version and have dependencies on this then you probably don't want to upgrade, but for the rest of us who don't write applications  in Office, it's probably not an issue.

So what really is there to say about Office for the Mac?

Well, it's Office. For the Mac.

For a lot of people this probably tells you all you need to know if you're moving over to the Mac for the first time or working in an environment where Office is the de-facto standard for document interchange. If you're used to office on Windows, this will give you the closest experience in terms of functionality you're familiar with, and it does it in a very ""Mac"" way.

If you know you need it, or you know you hate it (or both) then you're probably not reading this review. For everyone else, Office for Mac is a complete office application suite that works well in the Mac environment. Chances are it will offer 10x the features that you'll ever use, just like its Windows counterpart.

I wanted something that, quite frankly, made doing my books a snap -- as easy as writing a letter -- and I found it with Microsoft Accounting Professional 2008.

First off, let me state this -- if you are an average user of the Microsoft Office suite of products then Accounting 2008 is going to be a snap for you to use.  They have went to great lengths to make sure you don't need an Accounting degree to understand it.  A lot of the features not only integrate extremely well with Office 2007, but will remind you a lot of using Office (minus the ribbon interface).

One of the really nice features of Accounting is the ability to add third-party add-ins.  Out of the box you get an integration module for Paypal, so your invoices can automatically generate Paypal requests and Accounting can automatically classify and deduct the fees for it from the appropriate accounts.  As your business grows, and you decide that you need to do direct credit card processing, Accounting 2008 lets you integrate with CC processors directly -- again, handling managing the costs and fees for you.

Dashboards are another strong feature of this product.  How is my business doing?  What is my accounts payable looking like?  How much cash do I have on hand?  All that information and more is available through quick, convenient dashboards.  You can drill down into the dashboards to pull up reports to see more detailed data.

If you use Business Contact Manager for Outlook then you are in for a treat -- it integrates directly with Accounting to help you track not only customer information, but also communications and marketing camapaigns!  No more having to hunt and search for emails sent months ago or wondering if your marketing campaigns via e-mail are working.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with the product.  I think it has been a welcome upgrade from Peachtree and thanks to its integration with other products really brings my business into a 360-view.  I know immediately how well things are doing, what my customers are up to, and what needs my attention.

In short, this edition is only for children, people who have never used MS office before, or those using it only for the most basic of functinoalities.  Professionals, those used to versions 2000-2003, and those who need expert control of the program (i.e. macros and the like in Excel), then do not get this program, you'll have a tought time finding the same functionalities as in v. 2003.  But, since this is the special media edition, I did enjoy this one part of MS Office 2008.  It really does an excellent job of organizing all of my HD videos and photos, hence I give it 1 star over the regular version (which I rated a 3).  The visual interface of being able to see what files you are actually organizing instead of just icons and numbers really helps group the pictures and videos into exactly what I need, this is really a neat feature.  You can actually ""preview"" each media file without opening it, again saving you the time of figuring out what you are organizing.  Make sure, however, that you have more than the minimum system requirements for this special part of MS Office.  I put this version on one of my computers, I had more than enough RAM and processing speed, and the preview part would take up a lot of RAM, slowing down my computer quite a bit!!!

I'd reccomend staying with an earlier office product, and waiting for a new one to come out that is hopefully better for business professionals.

I am running Vista on the computer I installed the program on.  Although I followed installation directions faithfully, I was unable to update the product when following the suggested steps.  I could not update it until after I had completed registration, so I would advise registering the product before trying to do much else.  After registering the product, updates were installed seamlessly.  Updating was time-intensive, taking over  an hour over a DSL connection.  Luckily, this appears to be an infrequent occurrence.  After installing the updates, I set up the headset (a minor repair had to made--an ear piece had come apart and was easily fixed), and proceeded to try the program.

At first I was unable to try the program because of sound issues.  Although my system volume was not set high, the sound coming through the headset was entirely too loud to be listened to.  I had to go into my volume mixer and reset a variety of sound levels--and located the separate Rosetta Stone volume control--before volume was at a workable level.  All of the tries at updating and then sound issues made for a very slow start to beginning to enjoy the software.  But once all of the ""dust"" settled and I was able to begin the program, I was very favorably impressed.

The language-learning portion of the program is easy to use and customizable to what you wish to learn.  Are you more interested in spoken language?  Well, you can emphasize that and spend less time with written language.  The program's approach is indeed an immersion approach and doesn't require that you spend time overtly memorizing by rote, as many approaches to learning a language seem to take.  This makes the program a pleasure to use, particularly for visual/auditory learners.  The more you use the program, the more you will find yourself remembering and the more success you will have in your chosen language.  And, the more success you have in learning Italian, the more you will find yourself wanting to use the program.  You will be learning language in the same way a native speaker of the language learns.  The program creates such a positive learning experience, I find myself not wanting to miss a day of practice!

Currently, three of us are using the program, as the program does let you add users on the same computer.  Everyone proceeds at his or her own pace, and you may revisit lessons and set your user interface to learn whatever aspect of language interests you most.  The ability to go back and review is invaluable.  You may also set up your voice recognition software to be more or less ""strict"" about what it finds acceptable in terms of pronunciation.  One of the three program users in the household is taking an accelerated course in Italian at the local university and finds that this program is a wonderful adjunct to the live class, giving them extra practice and a pronunciation leg-up.  Other than the initial set-up hurdles, the three of us give the program a very big ""thumbs up.""  The program is well worth the price.

The Windows 10 ""Start"" menu is more like the one in Windows 8.1 (awful) than in Windows XP (terrific). It certainly is no improvement over Windows 7, which was barely useable and very ugly.

I upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking ""all apps,"" I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the ""all apps"" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove items which made the list, but not add back the missing stuff (except by a torturous series of edits using ""regedit,"" which Microsoft has hidden to discourage use of this very dangerous utility).

Microsoft is obsessed with the ""tiles"" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the ""all apps"" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the ""all apps"" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.). Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

Edge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.

Still, only one of my programs available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered. Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.

I suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others). If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.

UPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the ""programs"" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).

UPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who ""upgraded"" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.

UPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called ""Threshold Update""which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a ""service Pack,"" or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.

UPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called ""anniversary update"" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). For the past 11 months I installed and utilized ""Classic Shell,"" a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay have rendered the Classic Shell incompatible. Thus, those who preferred the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are stuck with the latest abomination.

The folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by the user  (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded programs). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless does not allow to be selected as the default security program.  And the ""no firewall"" doomsday message continues to appear.

Since installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed grudgingly to learn to live with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC), to somehow find my way through the cluttered and sometimes vague Settings menu, to locate and adjust to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction. But I sorely miss XP (which I continue to use on two computers).",Pretty -- As in Pretty Awful if You Prefer Using the Start Menu,1439251200,12.0,

I am a huge fan of PaintShop Pro and have been using it for years. So I was curious to see if this might be a replacement to PaintShop Pro (PSP) or a useful addition to it for my needs.  I am not a professional photographer, but I am a bit of an enthusiast. I own several DSLR cameras and quality lenses and have taken some photos that have been used in professional magazines and other professional venues.  But it is a hobby for me and certainly not my day job.

That said, I have become very proficient in Paint Shop Pro and have learned to use layers and I have various different accessories that I use, including color cards, Wacom Intuous digital styluses and more.  I can put a program through its paces.

Let's start off with the basics. This is NOT photoshop. It isn't Paint Shop Pro. It is something else altogether although it does have overlapping functionality with both of those programs.  The simplest way I know of to describe it is a lighter version of Photoshop/PSP, specializing in automation and cataloging.  It is for the professional who may come home from a wedding with several hundred (or thousand, if he/she has apprentices working) photos that need a lot of the same things done to each photo. For example, they all might need the same color correction or white balancing. Or there might be dozens with the same facial blemish that needs to be removed... Anything that needs to be done many times to similar photos is easily done here, and wouldn't be easily done in photoshop or PSP.  Corel purchased a pretty good program called Bibble Pro and has put their team to work on stylizing it more like other Corel products so that it will interact well with them and be relatively easy to use for photographers and editors coming from other Corel products.  Being version 3 of a product that was in version 5 when they acquired it, AfterShot Pro 3 is a mature program with a fair amount of testing and real-world use under its belt.

The program is also very good for cataloging. It will let you assign metadata to your files so that later you can easily find photos with an in-depth search function that makes it easy to find photos with keyword searches, and searches based on location and time and date and more.

Another nice feature is that it is non-destructive. The program makes all of its changes to it's own files, which tell the program what to do to the original raw file - at no time is the original ever changed.  You may end up producing a jpg that is different than the original raw file, but the raw file from the camera will always be kept as it was originally shot from the camera.

I had some learning curves to overcome and a couple of things that bothered me. One of the features of this program is that it is supposed to have a light footprint and run well, even on older computers.  It is also supposed to use the processing power of higher end graphics cards (which I have) to help speed up processing, resulting in a much faster workflow when processing hundreds or thousands of photos.  However, I also found some glitches.  For instance, when making changes to things like white balance or color tone, the screen would give me a very jagged, low quality image that remained that way until I interacted with the photo in some way.  A mouse click or something else would be required to force the proper redraw.  I found this immensely distracting and annoying and I did not readily see a way to fix it.  It doesn't do anything to the picture (everything is non-destructive) but it affects how the picture looks on screen and is annoying.

I also found a problem with easily getting back to the previous setting if I did something that I didn't like. Yes, there is an undo feature, but sometimes you are working within a screen where you haven't committed anything yet (like a white balance dropper) and it is not easy to return to a previous setting that you liked.

Finally, I found some instances where drop down lists would not drop down, even though they should.

I have included a photo of the ""jagged"" effect that I encountered.

Overall, Corel has done a good job of creating an inexpensive alternative to Aperture or Lightroom and it interacts well with PaintShop Pro (AND photoshop, interestingly) so this is arguably a solid choice for photographers looking for an inexpensive but high powered and high quality alternatives to the big guys.","A good, inexpensive alternative to Lightroom and/or Aperture",1465776000,35.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81duL23NvmL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-jL3EGzHL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Zwp6mUZ9L._SY88.jpg']"

The amount of export options has to be a big plus, and it includes the ability to easily format any video file or project for any of your mobile devices including your iPod, iPhone, Zune, PSP, etc.  That's a huge thing that many people are looking for.

Some of the newer options like HD and BlueRay authoring aren't going to get wide use immediately, but they are must-haves for the growing HD crowd out there.

Within Video Studio there are a few basic options.  The Movie Wizard is a quick and dirty import and export tool.  This is the easiest option to choose to convert, trim and condense video files.  There's also a bunch of templates included for standard transitions to add some openings, endings, fades and credits.  Once again, even with the Wizard alone you can really clean up some video files fast.

You can even import them directly from you digital recorder, but I opt to save my files and import them afterwords.  I always like to have a backup seperate from what I'm working on, so this makes it easier for me to keep track of my import and export areas.

In the full blown Video Studio tool you can open up video and audio files and add them to a project.  The benefit of that is that you can merge and splice your files and add custom transitions and graphics to really make your videos pop.  Once again, there's a lot of features here.  You really have to spend some time playing and exploring.

Media One is kind of an extra, but it makes it easy to do some basic graphics and picture stuff to add to your videos.  Another extra is Intermedia DVD player, which is included on many OEM system software packages but didn't come with my box.  So that's a nice extra too.

One positive thing is that there are a bunch of tutorials and help file documentats included on your extras disks.  There's also plenty of clips to play with and test your skills on.  If you haven't done video editing before that's probably the best place to start.

Still, I think this program is user friendly enough to do basic things like import / export and conversions out of the box.  Since most people will want to start by collecting all their videos, that's a nice plus in terms of the usability.

One con I have to note is that converting videos to certain formats seems to use pre-set frame rates that take some time to customize.  And it seems to convert some of these formats frame by frame, instead of using much faster file conversion techniques.  Behind the scenes it may be doing more, but for this price I don't really mind waiting a few minutes for my files to convert.

I also own the Pinnacle software that comes with their integrated hardware offering,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinnacle-Studio-MovieBox-Ultimate/dp/B000WEJN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinnacle Studio MovieBox Ultimate</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-Ultimate-Version-12/dp/B001AMSZSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio Ultimate Version 12</a>.  While there are more basic versions of the software that are closer in price to this guy, I find that the Corel Ulead software is more stable overall.

Don't get me wrong, the Movie-box ultimate package is a great value because it includes the hardware interface.  If you don't have all the connectors you need, that might be a good alternative.  But if you just compare software to software, Corel Ulead stacks up well against Pinnacle Studio Ultimate.

Truth be told, for this price I have to forgive the other minor cons I noted.  That includes mainly that the menu and icon graphics aren't the snazziest.  Still, compared to Apple's Built-in editor and Windows built-in movie editor (from Vista Ultimate) this guy includes more formats and features right out of the box.  And once again, for what you get this is really a great value in software.

Definitely check this out.  The Corel site has some clips and information to get you more used to the kinds of things you can produce.

At first I was skeptical about what they meant, but after using the program; yes it is a problem. I am going to cover that as well as several other points important to know.

Back up your company files right before loading the new version 2013. It only takes a second, and makes your test drive easily reversible.

You have a choice of jumping off of the diving board by loading the new version of QB 2013 by overwriting the old version, and then converting your existing company files but unconverting them, and restoring them is a major hassle. So the following is important to know.

You can run both versions of QuickBooks (in my case 2010 and 2013) concurrently/at the same time. So you are keeping your old version of QuickBooks intact while you try out the new one. (They currently have a 60 day return policy so take it for a test drive) This is important. When installing it asks you, ""Do you want to overwrite your old version?"" If you want to test it out and not go through the rigamarole of reconverting, or restoring your old version in case you want to send the new version back, say NO by choosing the option above it in order to write it to a new location. They already have a folder designated to do that when you choose that option and it is called ""QuickBooks 2013"". Don't worry about choosing your industry edition; you can always change it later from within QuickBooks. Note: If you install it on more than one computer you must install the same industry edition. This way you can try QuickBooks without over writing your existing version, OR converting your current company files over to the 2013 version either. So play with the sample file, or do as I did if you are creating a new company in addition to the old one. So with both version running and open, if I have an order from a customer from one company I can process it without having to open and close companies to access it. In plain words I have one click access to both companies. So both Qbooks versions are open, and both companies are open at the same time. That is something you cannot do if you only have one version of QuickBooks. You can however have two companies open if you install QB into a laptop also. (They allow you one other install but only if you use the same industry edition. So for example if you have a manufacturing company and a retail business they have different industry editions)

So now onto the three pound monster; the color schemes. In 2012 you had the option of choosing an assortment of color schemes. You don't have that option in 2013. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that they chose colors that create headaches; well at least in some people.  I love the way 2010 looks. It is reminiscent of Outlook 2007 with its soft blues and grays. It is pleasant to look at and easy to read. 2013 has the same icons and choices (how are they going to improve on something in any major way that has been through a zillion years of tweaking to make it Intuit-ive?) BUT they changed it slightly with the biggest problem as I see it (no pun intended) is they included black backgrounds with reversed out white letters. Our eyes get adjusted to that, and then on the same page they have these super soft letters on a bright background which is a seismic shift. I can see what they mean that this could give you a headache after awhile. So I thought I would convert it some by minimizing the left side navigation pane, which is easy to do with one click of the mouse, but the problem is that when you use any one of the features such as invoicing, credit memos, estimates etc up comes those screens with the same black header reversed out and you can't change that.  On a cerebral-vision basis it is not conducive to reducing the workload, but rather increasing it. Your eyes and vision set have to constantly readjust depending on which part of the page you are focusing on.  As soon as you open the program and spend a few minutes with it, you immediate feeling will be how do I change the black headers only to find out you can't. The headers also give you a feeling of the old DOS days; it is real basic and the level of graphics is Neanderthal. The rest of the work area is fine. I don't have any problem with soft lettering, or the nicely colored icons; just change the headers, and/or include some color scheme changes.
What else is there?

I have been using Intuit products since the DOS days in the 80's. Easy to use, intuitive, and great for small businesses. There is no way they are not going to fix this. There are too many people complaining about it. It will have a devastating effect on sales. Intuit is the best and I am sure they will be updating by re-creating the color scheme choice like they had in 2012, or at the very least go back to the pleasant default color scheme in some earlier versions. If they don't hold onto your 2012 version because they are going to become more and more valuable especially if Intuit stops making the 2012 version.

UPDATE: Okay I am going to have to tip my hat because Intuit did ""correct"" the problem. Why do I put quotes around correct? I don't want to nit pick but I have to be critical. What they did with R6 free update (R9 is out now) is ""Company File Color Scheme"" option is introduced in the ""Desktop View"" preference to allow users to change the color of the title bar and the border of QuickBooks windows for a particular company file, which will help users to differentiate between multiple company files. This preference will be replacing the ""Company Color Flag"" preference introduced in R4 release. We are offering 14 different ""Company File Color Scheme"" options to apply on various company files. This is a user level preference, which essentially means that various users connected to the same company file can select different colors. (R6)

That was a copy and paste from Intuit of the improvement. What it means is that the title bars have been made adjustable into some really nice colors. My main concern was how the large black background area with white text was creating an eye set, if I can use that expression which was pretty bold, and then you had to re-adjust your eyes in order to see the fine print in lighted out gray in the forms etc. So it was a headache waiting to happen. At first I dismissed others comments but then saw exactly what they were saying, and had to agree with them. So what did Intuit do? They did not get rid of the large black background to the main menu on the left, BUT you can minimize that so it is a small border on the left side of the screen. Then they gave you this option to change the title bar color options with some beautiful colors, while at the same time changing the title bar titles themselves into all caps to help balance the visibility out. All in all it is very useable now.

In all fairness in my 2010 version the invoices for example have black backgrounds with white letters in the inner title bars but the black bars are a lot thinner. 2013 has large black bars still. BUT with the other changes it is very manageable, and I would now have to say that I give the whole program a triple thumbs up and 5 stars. I also must admit that the left main menu is easier to read with a black background and white letters, rather than a lesser contrast option so they did good. The fact that you can minimize that whole window, and then you are working almost exclusively in your color choice (and the ones they give you are beautiful) makes this a top drawer program.

I will avoid repeating what others have said other than the conversion went basically flawless.  That is why i gave a rating of 5 stars.  I have a Dell laptop that i initially updated to Qucken premier 2010 to make sure there were no problems and made backup CD's and then restored them to the laptop before converting my desktop to 2010.  All went well with the backup and restore to the laptop. I have a desktop dell machine that is 5 years old that I mainly run quicken on, the laptop is my backup pc.

All went well with the upgrade with no problems that i can see both on the laptop and desktop.  I checked my account totals, reports, and they all matched up with what I had on quicken 2007.  Keep in mind that I also agree that year to year changes are minor and did not upgrade to 2010 until the last minute as my quicken 2007 support will end next month (no more online updates).  The on line account download for my visa account also went well along will all the other online accounts (about 6).  All the accounts updated without any problems.

When restoring from a backup of 2010 that i made on my laptop to the desktop dell, I did find some confusing issues.  I had a difficult time getting the quicken file (only one now with 2010) from my backup CD to the quicken directory on the desktop.  The program asks you where you want the file restored to.  I said the qucken directory.  When i selected that directory a bunch of old qdf files popped up to select from but not the most current 2010 file I had on the backup CD that I backed up from quicken 2010 was not listed.

I use quicken mainly for updating by checking account and visa accounts and do not use a lot of the other functionality of the program, so i maybe use only 10% of the program functionality.

I will provide an update if I run into any significant problems but so far it has been perfect.  I had no reason to upgrade other than the 3 year sunset rule quicken has for support which really means the online download will not work anymore if you do not upgrade.

After an hour or so I do no see any significant changes from Premier 2007 in 3 years other than some things have been shifted around and there are some new information screens.  I would not upgrade unless your 3 year time period is running out.

I would also recommend testing the upgrade on a similar pc is you use more than one PC before you delete your old version of quicken.

Save your money and wait as long as you can before upgrading and when you do upgrade to a new version wait at least 9 months for the bugs to get fixed.

UPDATE:  It has been a couple of weeks now since installing Quicken and all is going well with no major issues.  I have found that the Live Community Help is outstanding.  Type in a question and it usually has been answered.  Their search feature is very good as your question brings up very relevant answers to your problems.  I use Quicken 95% of the time for managing my Visa and bank accounts and doing budget reports.  Everything has worked almost flawlessly including reconciling bank accounts, backups and transaction downloads and reports.

There were a couple of quirky things that I needed help on: 1) Future bills would not show up in my register; 2) Preferences would not stay saved after restarting Quicken; 3) Quicken would not start on my bank account.  All the problems were solved through live community as people already found the answer for them.  I just needed to use classic view and change a couple of preference settings.

There is one quirky problem.  When you backup the backup file name is limited to 31 characters.  When i rename the backupfile the some of the preferences revert back to the default values after I get the file name too long error message.  I like to have my checking account show up as the home page.  With 2010 you need to use the classic view.  The backup issued caused my home page to go to the quicken default.  Also my billminder is shown on my accounts as a prefence and goes away also.

""Ziping"" programs that are out there. I can't recall what version of WinZip I have used most frequently but after using v. 17 I'm very pleased with the changes made to the software and it remains very easy to use and full of new and excellent features.

First things first though:

Setup:
Setting up the software on my Windows 7 machine was very easy. To save anyone a hassle, there is a printed serial number in your DVD case, mine was under the installation instructions on the inside-front of the case. You'll need the number for registration. After installing the application you'll go through the process of registering the software which does ask for a number of personal details such as address, name, etc. but only really requires your serial number and email address. Your email is used to send you a copy of the license or registration code. All in all setup was not bad at all.

--------------------

Use:
The interface of WinZip has changed a lot in the intervening years. The basic layout, however, is easy to navigate and understand even for a novice. The toolbar is laid out in a familiar tabbed form. Each tab containing additional tools and access to settings. My favorite new features are the inclusion of access to cloud storage service such as Google Drive, Dropbox and SkyDrive. I used WinZip 17 for example to compress a 15-minute video I made for my home owners insurance policy and uploaded it to my Google Drive storage all within the WinZip application! You'll of course need to have an account with one (or more) of the cloud storage services and authenticate first.

There are some advanced features here such as building self-extracting '.exe' files, adding document watermarks, encryption. I did not use these features so will refrain from further comment other than to say that they're present for those interested in such.

--------------------

What I like about this software:
(+) Tried and true ""zipping"" utility that does a good job
(+) Version 17 doesn't try to reinvent the wheel just polish what's there and add important and relevant new features
(+) Adding watermarks or converting documents to PDF is very, very easy
(+) Wondering just how much space you're actually saving by Zipping that file?... now each job features a memory report on how much memory is saved!

--------------------

What I don't like about this software:
(-) Some of the features require upgrading to the ""Pro"" version or require additional monthly fees - such as the FTP feature

--------------------

Bottom-line:
Corel has done a great job with WinZip. There is something here for old and new users alike. The inclusion of cloud-storage integration makes this a great product.","Long Time User, First Time Owner",1368835200,,

Not so bad: The Windows 8 screen is made for a touch screen or a large touchpad. It works fine with a smaller touch pad or mouse, however.

Bad: It keeps switching from Windows 8 Start screen to the Windows 7 Desktop. Why? It's not because you are really in Windows 7, because there is no real or easy control over what is there. And you are no longer on the Windows 8 screen. It needs to be one or the other.

Finding out how to do stuff is a pain, because it seems very disorganized--things are not located where I expect them. Part of this is the Mac-emulation of ""Here, let me do it for you,"" which also means, ""Do it my way.""  There are a number of reasons I don't buy Apple, and this is one of them, so I don't need their nonsense on my Windows machines.

Also bad: It is always on the Internet. It has cute pictures that run continuously, weather, etc., and you have to go to the trouble of turning it off. I spend a lot of time on the Internet. However, when I am working on something else, I don't need my machine spending time with open connections to the Internet. It is hazardous enough when I am actively online. Also, there are times I need the computing power of my machine and I don't want to share it.

She has enjoyed playing with animation software in the past, but up until Anime Studio Pro 8, she was never able to have her drawings traced and animated.  This software will do it, but it takes a lot of time to figure out 'how'.

This would be the negative to this software for the novice to intermediate user.  A tough learning curve that requires weeks, if not months of learning before you feel comfortable using it.  Some would argue that this is the case with most high-end software whether it relates to animation or not.  I would tend to agree, but it can be a con for some.

The positives to this software are many.  It can be used by PC or MAC users, offers the ability to bring your drawings to life, automatically lip-syncs your audio to the drawings, and allows you to import Photoshop files.

The Character Wizard is perhaps the easiest way to get started using the Anime Studio Pro 8 software, as you'll see results quickly and with the least amount of frustration.  Experts won't care about it, but if you're buying this to have fun with your computer and/or kids, start with with wizard!

The software is feature-rich with tweaks to color schemes, brush sizes, and layers (similar to Photoshop) which was expected.  What wasn't expected was the ability to do 3D renderings to share on YouTube.  Pretty cool stuff!  The ability to upload your creations to Facebook and YouTube is a fun perk.

Advanced users will love the ability to script their own tools and add-ons for the program, but frankly, this user will never get to that point!

All the major video formats are supported, with output up to 1080p and even in 3D.

Made for professional digital artists and animation professionals, Anime Studio 8 is loaded with amazing features and delivers what it promises on that front.

If you do not fall into that category of user, you may find it overwhelmingly hard to learn anything but the basics through the wizard.  You can learn more than that on your own, but it takes time in the form of a lot of reading and hands-on trial and error.  If you're brave enough to give it a try, and can commit to learning it, you'll be rewarded.","Great software, tough learning curve",1337472000,,

Unlike many other reviewers, I have not had any problems with the upgrade, and the functionality and performance is OK, even with many years of accumulated data.

But I hate having to upgrade Quicken because:

* It costs money.  I wouldn't mind paying for occasional upgrades if they provided any real improvement, but having used Quicken for many years and gone through many upgrades, I can't remember the last time that a new version gave me a significant new capability that I use.  Just thought of one:  many years ago when they finally added multi-currency support.

* The user interface always changes between versions.  I suppose these are ""improvements"", but now I have to learn how to do things over again.  I don't mind learning new things if doing so provides new benefits, but in the case of Quicken it is usually because they have arbitrarily rearranged things.  Imagine that every so often someone came over to your house and reorganized your kitchen or garage - and then how long would it take you to find things again?

* You have to clean up all the new advertising icons that the installation litters on your desktop.

* Disappointment that YET AGAIN things that I actually need have not been addressed.  For example, the 2009 version still doesn't make handling CDs easy, yet these are very common.  I would have gladly paid the cost of the 2009 upgrade if they would have fixed this ONE thing, but no.  Maybe in Quicken 2025.

At that time McAfee was the best there was.  This is no longer true.  In my opinion the best current anti virus product is ESET NOD32.

I recently tested McAfee 2012 vs Kaspersky 2011 (and Kaspersky 2012).  On testing a scan of one partition McAfee reported that it scanned 51,221 files and took one and a half hours to do it.  On the same partition Kaspersky (minor differences between the 2011 version and 2012 version) reported that it tested 779,264 files and took one hour and five minutes.

McAfee 2012 consumes 86 MB of memory (""private bytes"") and 412 MB of virtual memory.
Kaspersky 2012 uses 195 MB of memory (""private bytes"") and 596 MB of virtual memory.

Kaspersky 2011 was slightly nicer in that it reported the elapsed time to do a scan, the new version 2012 only reports when the scan finished.

Kaspersky's install is well done and impressive as it detected and removed traces of McAfee which were left behind after McAfee was uninstalled.

Kaspersky has one very valuable feature a ""rescue disk"" (a bootable disk which you can use for a clean scan of an infected system) which neither ESET nor McAfee provide.

I like the ease of use and clear reporting of Kaspersky.  It's a good product (but can't match ESET NOD32).",Slow But Good,1323907200,3.0,

What you will immediately notice is that all the real expense is in the subscription to the their database ($20 a month or $100 for six months).  Without that you aren't going to do much research.  I've been using the 2011 version and I don't see a lot of changes, but I do find that integrating data from the searches is going much smoother.  I like that this comes with six months of access to their database.  What I find is that every few years I like to do some research and update my family tree.

Then I buy a new version with 3-6 months of Ancestry.com access and then do some more updating.

If that's your plan, decide how much time you want to spend.  If you are just getting started the six month subscription is nice, though three months is a good chunk of time.  The book that comes with this would be helpful for a beginner.  It might even help me if I read it, but that's not going to happen.

Now if you are a serious researcher and expect to keep the online subscription going for years, there isn't a lot of savings to be had by buying this, but you do save a few dollars over the web price.  If you buy an older version the price will go down a lot and then it can be a bargain.  In fact for years I would just buy ""last year's"" software because I could get web access for 3-6 months for about $20.

Note that for access to their overseas database you will pay more ($150 for six months) and for their most all encompassing subscription (which includes very extensive newspaper databases) you will be $200 for six months.

I've used Roxio software on my PC for years so when I changed to Mac, Toast was a logical app for me to look at.  It's been the standard for years on the Mac.  While some Apple apps have the ability to write to CD/DVD, their capability is limited.  Toast is the most complete, do it all app for the Mac.

First, let's talk about what it can't do... copy commercial movie DVDs.  Toast will not copy DVDs that are copy protected (most commercial movie DVDs). While it may make a copy, it will be unplayable or unwatchable.

But, Toast does almost everything else you might want to do with making DVDs and CDs...  copying, making archive files (ISO, IMG, etc), authoring DVD (making menus,menu screens, adding backgrounds,etc).  It can also take videos and movies and optimize (compress) them for best performance on tablets and phones, upload them to social sites, and let you do light editing.  By light editing, I'm referring to taking clips and combining them.  For more comprehensive editing, you can use iMovie (free) or one of many commercial apps.  Toast also handles audio files.  It can read most file types and convert them if needed to other types.  It comes with a program that allows you to edit and clean up audio. While not as feature laden as some apps, it does most of the things you would need to do.

If you purchase this and are going to install it on a Mac running El Capitan (latest OS), my suggestion is not to use the DVD that came in the box.  The box I received had a slightly older version that has some issues with El Capitan.  Roxio allows you to download and install the app from their website. When you do that you get the latest version. It also makes installation on the newer MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs (no DVD drive) easy.

So far the software has performed well.  I only have 2 complaints... sometimes certain features are hard to find.  I wanted to save a DVD to an ISO file.  By default, Toasts save an image to it's own filetype.  It took me a while to find out how to save it to an ISO file.  It's not as intuitive as Roxio's PC software (Creator).  This was the case with a couple of things I tried to do.  I also had a problem once installing it.  I installed it when I first got it and everything went fine.  About a month later, I changed the drive in my Mac and reinstalled everything.  The only software that didn't work was Toast.  It activated and appeared to work, but would hang when I actually tried to write a file or DVD.  I uninstalled it and did a reinstall and it's been working fine... probably just an anomaly.  Toast does not have an uninstall option or program. However they have good instructions on their website.

Even with a few problems, I will continue to use Toast and see it as the best app of it's type for the Mac.",Roxio Toast - the standard for DVD/CD burning software on the Mac,1450396800,,

I migrated all my financial data to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iBank-4/dp/B003WT1KAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iBank 4</a>, a far more full-featured and better-supported application. The tipping point was to be told in October 2012 by Intuit not only that there is still no full upgrade to Quicken for Mac 2007, but also that as I'm not a US resident Intuit would not even provide me with the Mac OS X 10.7 Lion-compatible version of Quicken for Mac 2007 from the PowerPC version (16.0.2.- R3) I had been using!

I was a long-term user of Quicken, with 14 years of financial data recorded in it from June 1998 to October 2012.  I had been using both Macs and PCs (Macs preferred) since 1984. I migrated my financial data to Quicken in 1998 from an earlier Mac personal accounting application called Dollars & $ense, from a company called Monogram which went out of business about the same time their product succumbed to the Y2K bug.

Intuit long has had a popular and evidently well-supported financial software range for Windows, but its product development and support for the Mac platform went into terminal decline after 2007. Its support and customer service for Mac users now have degraded to a point of non-existence or uselessness. What totally impenetrable thinking led Intuit to this incredible outcome?  The answer is a mystery. Would Microsoft throw away its market advantage by failing to maintain cross-platform compatibility between Mac and Windows versions of MS Office, or Adobe its cross-platform compatible market dominance in imagery and PDF processing? No way!

When the initially excellent Quicken for Mac 2007 started showing its age, Intuit engaged in some two years of beta-testing and consultation with the Mac-user community.  This was among the largest scale, most hyped beta-testing and consumer consultations ever for any Mac product. It turned out that the long promised, much hyped Quicken Mac upgrade was nothing but vaporware. The only result was a dumbed-down standalone product, so-called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], the exact opposite of everything that the Mac-user community told Intuit we need!  Is it any wonder that we Mac users feel that Intuit has treated us with contempt?

Intuit's failure to build on its market potential with Mac users is a tragedy and farce. I highly recommended Quicken for Mac 2007 in earlier times when it was justly the market leader. Now, sadly, I must strongly recommend that Mac users avoid the product and its makers.

More than seven years now have passed since this last release of Quicken for Mac, in August 2006. Intuit never updated this out-of-date product -- merely patched it two or three times when its bugs and incompatibilities stopped it working in new versions of Mac OS X. Since 2010 Intuit has not even updated its only other personal finance software for Mac, the absurdly named&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], a downgrade of Quicken for Mac which has even fewer essential features than its obsolete predecessor.

What on earth has been going on at Intuit that it has abandoned Mac product development? My best guess is that some totally unrealistic and irrational feedback, typically from a small number of noisy Mac personal finance users, has convinced Intuit that we Mac users are just creative types and airheads with no grasp of the mathematical logic, rational thinking and work discipline required to use full-featured personal financial accounting.

The unreasonableness of some customer negative feedback on personal finance software would be enough to alienate the most helpful software developers. Typically, the noisiest unreasonableless ranges across complaints about non-core, third party functions like bank downloads; blaming software for user error, or the consequences of user failure to read user manuals or to follow simple universal accounting principles. Has this unreasonableness convinced not only Intuit, but also other personal finance software makers, that we Mac users are financial and computer illiterates not worth their time and trouble? Could the impossible-to-satisfy high maintenance demands of financially illiterate customers also explain why even Microsoft never released its former personal finance product, Microsoft Money, for Mac -- and discontinued it for Windows in 2009?

Since migrating from Quicken for Mac 2007 to iBank in 2012, I am now in my third year with iBank. I highly recommend the current version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iBank-5-Download/dp/B00GUXLRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iBank 5 [Download</a>] to all Mac users who are unafraid of the tiny amount of work, rational thinking and user manual reading necessary for serious, accurate personal finance recordkeeping. iBank's makers, IGG Software (with whom I have no association, except as a satisfied paying customer) specialize only in personal finance software for the Mac OS and portable iOS devices, iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.

I have almost 16 years of continuous, detailed, accurate data in iBank. This is the best move I ever made in personal finance recordkeeping -- but the most unrealistic, unreasonable and absurd remarks I ever have seen about personal finance software continue to flow in attacks on iBank. Among the most absurd claims is that either of the two outdated Quicken personal finance products is as good as, or better than, the state-of-the-art iBank software, which has had more feature-rich updates in the past year than both Quicken Mac products in their combined lifetimes. This is not a matter of opinion or taste: it is objective fact about all the long list of capabilities iBank has, which are lacked by the Quicken Mac deficient duo.

In these days of widespread fake review writing, star ratings averaged from total positive or negative reviews in Amazon are less trustworthy than ever for product evaluation. Unfortunately, there is no certain method for distinguishing a merely silly or misinformed review from a fake. Significantly, a much higher proportion of helpful customer votes (far more difficult to fake than reviews) appears in Amazon on substantiated, detailed and factual positive reviews of iBank than on negative reviews and comments. The distribution of helpful votes gives the most accurate picture of what the Amazon customer community really thinks about products.

Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.
This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.
The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)
I've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.
As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.
I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:
* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever
* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start
* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP
* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically
* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP
* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.
* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.
And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.
In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.
I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.

When I first installed it and found that the (controversial) ribbon from Office 2007 for PC wasn't there, I felt like I had been cheated somehow.  However, as I used Office for Mac more, I found that the ribbon was the least of my worries.  I have two primary criticisms...

First, Office 2008 is exceedingly slow.  I have a 3.06GHz C2D iMac with 4Gb RAM and this is, without doubt, the slowest launching program I have.  Even after multiple updates, it's still 2-3x slower than Pages on first launch.  Furthermore, while using the program, actions like autocorrection, etc take almost a full second to implement, during which time Office stops responding graphically (it's actually working, just not displaying anything until it churns through the autocorrect, after which it ""speed types"" in what was in the buffer).

Second, the Thesaurus is also particularly disapppointing, since it doesn't seem to be able to sense the forms of words.  Many ""-ing"" words show their root in the thesaurus, which you then use to find a synonym and, after inserting, you have to go back and manually change the form.  Ridiculous.

Third, there appears to be a bug (perhaps related to the autocorrect lag) where changes to a document sometimes cause a ""visual corruption.""  It's difficult to explain, but an example would be where a significant amount of text is changed from double-space to singe-space.  After doing so, it is entirely possible to have a ""phantom"" sentence on the page that disappears if you scroll up then back down.  It's almost as if Word correctly moved everything, but forgot to update the screen to show the changes.

There are several other problems that I just don't have the heart to detail here (some of them are personal frustrations with design decisions).  The bottom line, however, is that this is the first Office suite in 15 years that I have wished I could ""unbuy.""  There are too many ""annoyances"" here.  It could be that I use documents between Office 2007 on a PC and 2008 on a Mac, but shouldn't there be 100% compatibility. Perhaps the 2011 version will be better, but for the time being, this is the single most frustrating piece of software I currently have on my iMac, primarily because I know how well it works on the PC side.

And I say forced because Microsoft made sure that key features of my OS was not working anymore, including its security. So, Win7 was a brief yet not a bad altogether experience - if one disregards numerous lack of customization options and the palpable effort of Microsoft to make us abandon them yet again, that is. Such as stopping our desktop widgets from working in order to promote the ""brilliant"" Win8 tiles! Nevertheless, what I want to make clear is that I am comparing Win10 to an extensive background on WinXP and an adequate experience with Win7.

ALL YOUR BASES ARE BELONG TO US
Two words: forced updates. I was lucky enough to have opted for the Professional edition of the Win7, so when I got to switch to Win10, I received the Professional edition as well - which comes with the option to defer (yet still not pick between or even cancel) the installation of the latest updates. Currently, I am trying to ignore the Action Center notification for an nVidia update, that keeps pestering me to install it since las week. The Home edition, however, does not give the user any such option and all updates are forced onto him. Remember how after numerous ""essential"" updates in the past, our PCs encountered a myriad or mysterious problems that were never solved before the next update, months later? Yeah, there is no more avoiding these problems anymore.

A PRIVACY NIGHTMARE
From the initial Logging in only with a Microsoft-confirmed eMail account to the Groove Music and the Movies & TV Players amassing info on your files and personal habits, including the content of our eMails which MS ""reserves the right"" to pass on (read: sell) to unnamed third parties(!). There is no avoiding it: Win10 are a private person's worst nightmare. In a sense, Win10 are the basis of the most intrusive and abusive DRM ever to be slipped in in our computers, coupled with the most blatant disregard for a person's privacy at home. There had been an uproar even since the pre-release builds and some deactivation options are now available - but they are far from thorough and very prone to turning back on by themselves after a while. And it now begs the question: how much can one trust a company that silently downloaded Win10 to every WinVISTA, Win7 and Win8 PC without the consent of their owners?

NO, IT IS NOT FASTER BY ANY MEANS!
Microsoft did not allow us to perform a clean install when upgrading from a previous Microsoft OS; however, using one's product Serial Number, it was possible to download the official image and burn it onto a disk (or transfer it to an empty USB). In preparation for the upgrade, I increased my system's RAM to 12GM and a few days after the initial update, I formated and did a clean install. Then I went on installing only software that was Win10 compatible. Keep this information in mind when I tell you that Win10 are SLOW. Slower than Win7 and much, much slower than WinXP! It takes forever to transfer files to and from a USB flash drive (a problem that started with Win7, supposedly to prevent data loss when removing drives insecurely, yet still with no option to toggle it on and off). What is more aggravating, it takes forever to explore folders, especially those on my second HDD, even if they were opened just a few moments ago.
So, why is it not faster? Is it because of an increase in cosmetic additions and aesthetic customizations? No. Absolutely no. Kindly read on.

ESSENTIAL CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS ARE MISSING
The Windows interface and Menu options look worse than Win7. Aero Glass, for some unfathomable reason, is not available. The Windows borders are not customizable (for the first time since Win95!). Quick Launch can be made to appear with some Registry editing (I would advise Googling it - carefully!) yet the icons in this DIY Quick Launch now cannot be centered in the Toolbar and they stay misaligned to the Task View button; the option of which icons and how to appear in the Taskbar is missing; whereas, this latest shinny OS refuses to learn that I do not like every shortcut to have a ""Shortcut to"" prefix to every shortcut I create - something Win98 had no problem learning after the third time I removed it on a new one.
There is a semi-official piece of software (no, I am not calling them Apps!) called Windows Ultimate Tweaker 4: I would recommend it as it does offer a number of options, some of which are very useful. However, one of the most important ones (specifically: which new file-templates and options to appear when right-clicking on the desktop) -you guessed it!- is missing.
And do not get me started on the Start Menu!

WHY MESS WITH SOMETHING THAT WORKED FINE?
Win8 were a complete failure mainly because of their Start menu. We all loved the WinXP Start Menu, easy to use, a breeze to customize and backup when needed. Win7 improved on it, even if, quite counter-intuitively, one had to use libraries in order to add personal folders in the Start Menu. Yet, everything was at the right place. Well, not so much with Win10.
The Power button now looks like any other and is to be found between(!) All-Apps and Settings - and when pressed (remember that this will also be needed to be done at 2:00AM after 12 hours of working on a screen) one has to read and carefully select between the Shut Down or Restart options that appear. Every single time. With no confirmation dialog.
The installed software (All-Apps) are alphabetized easy to navigate - yet its folders do not respond to Right-clicking them. They are just dead.
The Tiles Panel, however, this is where they screwed up again: none of the tiles are customizable in other aspects than total size (resulting in beautiful icons looking ridiculous in all that empty background). Why can we not readjust the sizes of the contained icons? And yet they even failed to adjust the tile sizes correctly!
The Tiles Panel allows resizing but only in huge pre-set steps. We can also move and group the tiles. Some (but not all) tiles come in 4 sizes, others in 3 yet most in only 2 sizes. The step-wise increments of the Tile Panel create space for 6 small tiles in each group. (if you are asking why, I shall tell you why: because 5' screen Windows Phones can show 6-tiles, that's why!). Have less than 6 tiles in a group and the empty space is an ugly waste. Moreover, no tile under them can grow to fill the space under 6 small tiles, so, once again, more ugly wasted space.
Oh, and for some another mysterious reason, not all installed software can be pinned to the Tile Panel, even if they do appear in the All-Apps list! You have to hunt for them in your Program Files and find the executable.

COMPATIBILITY MODE IS STILL A JOKE
Drakensang: The Dark Eye is not an old game, barely 5-6 years old and it is supposed to be Win10 compatible. At least its expansion is, and that run fine. The original game, however, refused to run under any ""compatibility mode"". Does this thing finally do anything besides reducing the resolution, Microsoft? You know, like trying running a few years old software under DirectX 9.0c or something?

ALL KNOWN BUGS ARE STILL THERE
The Recycle Bin still refuses to use its customized icons, just like with Win7. The Explorer folders are still unable to retain my Viewing preferences. And the Desktop still ...looses files (especially saved web-pages) one then has to hunt down with the Explorer (even if they are still in the Desktop folder).

Overall, not a failure of WinVISTA or Win8 proportions but nowhere near as good as WinXP - or even Win7 for that matter.

I am willing to accept this as a work in progress and give them 6 months to get their act together and patch things up.
Yet they should not think that they will get a free ride just because they claim to be giving it away for ""free"". Because it was not.

If you want to do some fun, different effects easily to your pictures, honestly, Pixelmator isn't for you.  Yes, it can do a lot of manipulation, but there is a learning curve, and to really make it fly you're going to invest hours in learning all its ins and outs.

So Pixelmator is stuck in the middle, between the free, easy, less powerful online programs and the very difficult, very powerful, very expensive programs like Photoshop.  If you want more power than what you can get from online editors and have some time to invest to learn the program, Pixelmator would be a good choice.  BUT....

I also like the feature that Trend has added to the last few versions of this software which is to identify on web search result pages whether or not the sites that come up are safe -- the software shows safe search results in green, questionable sites with a question mark, and unsafe sites with a red ""X"".  We have an older version of Trend Micro at work that doesn't have this feature, so I feel much safer surfing the net at home.

Since this is an upgrade for me rather than a completely new installation, I can't speak to how easy it is to install and configure these days.  It was a little bit hard to configure the software back when I first got the program some six years ago, but once I got it up and running the way I wanted, I've never had to do much of anything to change it and I suspect they've improved the initial set-up as so many other things in the program have improved over the years.

Other people can probably give you a more geek-specific review, but in the six years in which I've been running Trend Micro on my computers in one version or another, I've never had a virus that made it onto my system or that Trend Micro has missed and any other scan has caught (and I periodically run a scan with other software just to be safe).  When I replaced Norton with my third version of Trend Micro, it caught some nasty spyware that Norton had missed.  I will happily exchange a few seconds of connection time for good security and I'm not even sure I'm losing much time anymore.

** CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE 10/29/09 **
It seems that a lot of upgraders have been complaining about the upgrade process, especially from XP. Most of us expected to be able to format our hard disks and be prompted for either the XP disc or product key. Alas, this is not the case. The upgrade is much more complicated than it should be and some workarounds have been discovered

Method A (simplest)
If you already have an older version of Windows on the hard drive, finish the Custom Install,  without entering the product key.  After installation, go to your System Properties and click the link to activate Windows.  Enter your product key and it should activate.  This has worked for me twice.

Method B (hardest)
If Method A doesn't work, try the registry hack.
1. Finish the custom install without entering the product key then click Start and type regedit.exe into the ""Search programs and files"" box.
2. In the registry, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/.  In the pane on the right, you'll see an entry for MediaBootInstall.  Double-click on it and change the value from ""1"" to ""0"" and click OK.
3. Close regedit and go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories then right-click on Command Prompt and select ""Run as administrator.""  You'll get a UAC alert, click Yes.
4. At the command prompt, type: slmgr /rearm and hit Enter.  Reboot.
5. Now try to activate.  If it fails, make sure there are no pending Windows Updates to install.  If there is, install them, reboot and start over from Step 4.

Method C (most time consuming)
Perform the Custom Install and skip the product key. Once completed, run the upgrade again from within Windows 7 but this time, enter the Windows 7 upgrade key and then activate Windows.
** END UPDATE **

I had been running the Windows 7 release candidate for 3 months and the full version 2 weeks before official release date.  The experience convinced me to finally upgrade my Windows XP systems to 7.  This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.

PERFORMANCE & STABILITY
One of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.

64-BIT
I am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.

DESKTOP
At first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have ""pinned"" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.

LIBRARIES
Windows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.

NETWORKING
Even as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.

SECURITY
Security in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender.  Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton/dp/B002L7BR20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton</a>.  User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions.  Coming from XP however, it is still annoying.  Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives.  Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt.

POWER MANAGEMENT
Power management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.

WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER
I've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.

WINDOWS XP MODE
For applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode. Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.  XP Mode is available in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Professional/dp/B002DHGM50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Professional</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Ultimate/dp/B002DHLV8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;editions.

RECOMMENDATION
If you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading.  Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements.  For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice.  If you decide on Windows 7 Home Premium and need to upgrade more than one PC, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Upgrade-Family-Pack/dp/B002MV2MG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack</a>, which is an excellent deal.  I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional.  I suggest a clean install for best results.  If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.

SUMMARY
Windows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for.  It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use.  Windows 7 will make your old system feel fresh and new again.  New system owners with Windows 7 pre-loaded can feel confident that they're getting the best Windows OS ever produced.",Here Comes Windows 7,1256169600,126.0,

This is NOT the program for an average person looking to do casual drawings, floor plans, flow charts, etc. If you are an average user, the best program to use for you is likely to be Microsoft Visio.

Comparing v10 to previous versions:

You are going to either love or hate the ribbon. I like it. So do the people in my drafting department, including people who have been using Autocad for 10+ years.

You're going to need just one piece of hardware -- a camera! (either a webcam or DSLR). If you already have a webcam set up, it will appear in Stopmotion Studio as a Camera Device in the dropdown menu as an option.

Before you start a stopmotion movie, you need to specify the Capture Size (resolution) and Frame Rate. The highest Capture Size you can select via a dropdown menu is camera dependent. For example, using my webcam, I can select a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080 (Full HD). The frame rates you can select via another dropdown menu range from 5 to 30. For more fluid motion in your stopmotion movie, select a higher frame rate. But remember, if you pick 30 as the frame rate -- that's 30 frames per second -- you're going to need to re-position and take snapshots of your character(s) 30 times to get  a WHOPPING ONE second of movie!

The Stopmotion Studio interface is very intuitive. It consists of 3 panels: (1) View Screen (2) Control Panel (3) Storyboard (filmstrip). The View Screen gives you a liveview of your camera. After you capture a snapshot, a thumbnail of it appears in the Storyboard. You can play and edit your movie in the Storyboard as you go along. The Control Panel lets you add a grid to the liveview in the View Screen to help you position your characters precisely where you need them (the grid size can be adjusted). One VERY nifty feature in the Control Panel is called Key Drawing. Key drawing lets you sketch over the View Screen, so you can mark the position(s) of your character(s) in the next frame.

There are also special effects you can play around with, like green screen, which allows you to change the background (your backyard, for example) after production. You can also get really artistic and use the drawing and painting tools to add other elements (like gunsmoke, flare, and laser beam).

There are added benefits by purchasing Office 365 Home Premium;however, you are renting so if you decided not to renew you no longer own the rights to having Office 2013.  I had already purchased Office 365 Home Premium prior to the copy I received in the prime program.

The benefit of the subscription is you are allowed to have Office 2013 installed on 5 computers.  It is important to note that you will need to use the Microsoft account you used to register the software to install the software on the 5 computers.  There is no option to send other household members a link to install the software.  You do not need to stay logged once the software is installed.  It is also important to note that you will need Windows 7 or 8 to install Office 2013.

If you are already using Office 2010 I do not see any major improvement to move to Office 365. Office 2013 is very similar to Office 2010 but integrated with the cloud.

Here some of the biggest issues I have with Office 365 Home Premium.  I reached out to Microsoft support to verify my findings. I kept the complete chat log.

All these so called benefits / add-ons are only good for the person who signed up for Office 365 Home Premium.

20GB Skydrive, Skype Account, Office on Demand only apply one account.  There is no option to create a sub-account for household members. Your only option would be to share your account and password information. While I have no issue providing my spouse my information but I will not provide my credentials to my account.  You can sign them up a regular Microsoft account, so that gets a 5GB skydrive, Office Web Apps that integrates with Office 2013

That being said as the primary account holder you do get a good value. Microsoft recently added the Office App for Android and IOS.

I had a skydrive when they offered 25GB, so I now 45GB of cloud storage that I can sync between by laptop and desktop with a Skydrive install.

I rarely used Skype in the past and that will most likely continue even with the included minutes.  I still have not used the Office on Demand, so I cannot provide an opinion

You have to decide if Office 365 Home premium.  If there was more flexibility with household accounts I would rate a minimum of 4 stars.  If you are XP and Vista user you should not purchase this product.

If you work at a company that has an active Microsoft Enterprise Agreement you should check with the EA Administrator because you may have access to the Home Use Program which allows you to purchase Office 2013 for $10

I did get a lot out of the German one but I had taken a German class in college.  The Danish one not so well as my pronounciation of Scandanavian vowels is lacking.  Fortunately the Danes speak American English.

The Mandarin course is a bit different in that it teaches Chinese Letters too though you can decide to do the entire course using only the Roman alphabet.  I found the software can be as easy or as Challenging as you wish.

The Course is presented in three sections.  A basic, intermediate, and more advanced sections.  You create a profile for yourself and based on your age and gender the software will compensate for you on its voice recognition software.

The best thing about the course is the voice recognition.  You say the words and the system tell you if you are correct.  I can't pronounce English very well so I'm not quite sure how accurate it is.

The Basic course is pretty simple.  It teaches you touristy things like eating, walking, running, cooking, and the differences in gender.  I like rosetta stone because it emmerses you in the language.  It doesn't try to translate.  You infer from the pictures what you are saying.

The courses get harder and harder as you go along.  I found I tend to forget what I learned in the class if I try to remember but pick it up again immediately when confronted with it in real life.

We send it, and the information on retrieval can be given to the recipient via telephone, fax, email or even text messages.  They retrieve it at a convenient time, and everyone is happy.

It's reliable.  We've not had a single file become corrupted or lost.  With 100% accuracy, we feel secure in the knowledge that the file will arrive intact, giving us peace of mind.

Granted, it's not cheap.  But we haven't found a cheap solution to the large file transfer yet that is nearly this accurate or easy.  Often in the past we would spend hours attempting to successfully transmit a file, only to have it fatally error at the end, resulting in lost effort, time and productivity, and causing the entire process to repeat itself.  This is particularly irritating when either you or the recipient is up in the middle of the night to do this transfer!  With SendStuffNow, there are no more irritating and slow uploads to error.

How ""expensive"" it is also depends on how many transfers are regularly done by your company.  For efficiency, reliability, simplicity, and security, it's a five star program.  Cost is something that can only be determined by your usage level and is very individual.

You absolutely must validate each disk image you create and then mount it to test that the saved image files are readable. And you must save complete or updated hard drive images frequently, I do it monthly, so you have the data you need is saved in case you need it.

If your system fails and your saved image is 6 months old, you have lost 6 months of data unless you have saved it on some other restorable media.

 On a recent trip, I was navigating. In a car moving at expressway speeds, the results in the search box were impossible to read because the type is so small. The address I was looking for is a house that was built in 1993. Neither it nor the surrounding community are to be found on the these maps.

 In my own area, within a six block radius, both MapPoint 2009 and Streets & Trips 2009 list four restaurants that closed three or more years ago. Another restaurant, which has been located at its current location for at least ten years, is still shown at its former location a couple of miles away.

 Importing is a relatively smooth process and you can use Excel, Access, Outlook contacts or any of several text formats.

 You can create territories from data or manually. Pushpin styles are limited, compared to the last version, but you can add your own.

 Once the data is mapped, you can massage it in a variety of ways, including creating routes between multiple pushpins.

 Overall, I think both Microsoft mapping products have taken a step backwards from the most recent versions. Neither MapPoint 2009 nor Streets & Trips 2009 have any features compelling enough to make the upgrade and the maps appear to be the same. I'd hold off for the next version or consider competitive products. By all means, try out the Microsoft evaluation version before you purchase this product.

BACKGROUND:  I've used Paint Shop Pro for years.

I'm not a graphics artist, but when I need to do any kind of image editing, I can usually find my way around in PSP to do what I need to do.

- Installed easily, boots up without issues
- Seems speedy for the amateur that I am
- Has a full set of functions and features

WHAT COULD BE BETTER

It reminds me of some shareware programs that disable features until you buy the full version, but in this case you have already bought the full version and they still want to get more money from you!  I'm sort of the ""go to"" guy in my circle of friends and family when it comes to technical and/or business software and even though I would never spend a penny on this, noticed a friend had purchased this so I decided to see for myself and it only reiterated how disgusting Intuit's business practices are.  Here are a few reasons why you should avoid this program:

Payroll.  The ability to write paychecks and pay income withholdings is one of the most basic accounting tools one would expect from a ""pro"" accounting package but it is missing from this program.  Even if you do it yourself, you have to pay an extra $200 each year to have the privilege downloading tax forms and you can only shell out the extra $200 for 3 years because after spending $600 in the end of the 3 years, you'll have to buy the newest version of Quickbooks.

Again, this is for DO IT YOURSELF!  You'll print the checks on your own paper, your own computer and all they'll do is give you the tax tables.  They can easily integrate the tax tables in the software but their excuse is that it may not be up to date.  That is a complete cop-out because all they would have to do to fix that is to let you adjust the table if rates go up or down;  besides, they require you to replace the program every 3 years anyway.

They used to offer one free tax table download in the older versions but they wanted more money and they got rid of that. There IS a hidden ""manual payroll"" option, but even if you can find it past all the ads for subscriptions, they get you if you want to print the forms for the IRS.  Yes, in order to use the same IRS forms that you can download for free from the IRS, you have to pay intuit for their integrated version.

file attachments
As others have mentioned, you have to pay to save attachments to invoices in your own computer!

bloatware
What was one a simple program now install a ton of nagware that you don't want with no option to shut it off.

no easy way to export
They know they got you so they don't have any tools to convert their files to other format.

/*****************************edit**************************************************/
I give up.  Intuit using their ""customer retention managers"" to pressure amazon to delete negative reviews and comments aside, since the changing of the new social security tax rate (employee end), I can no longer print my tax forms and at the begging of my CPA, I was convinced that I have to get the new version AND since the new version doesn't let you print tax forms without subscribing to ENHANCED PAYROLL AND PAYING EXTRA FOR THE UNLIMITED EMPLOYEES, this $200 program will cost me around $500 for the first year and around $300 each following year until they force me to upgrade again.

This is a MONOPOLY.  So enjoy my money for now Intuit, you have won this round. The time will come when the DOJ hits you with an anti-trust lawsuit, FTA will come down on you for making fake positive reviews, or an enterprising software company beats you at your own game.

If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.","If you've used TurboTax before, you know what to expect.",1388966400,,

A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.

I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.

And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.

In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!

This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.

UPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: A shot back into time as we are on the cusp of the Great Depression [1930] in Nancy Drew's latest adventure mystery.  What can we learn from this era? What timeless things are ours to explore in the town of Titusville [in the midwest]?  I found fascination about this time warp, but actually learned nothing unique as I used the tools and ideals brought out from that decade.

INITIAL SCORE: 85

CHARACTERS:

Emily Crandall:  Nancy is out to learn from a friend of a friend what is upsetting this teenager and soon is on a two-part mystery that involves theft of family jewelry and a possible forgery of an estate will.  Emily was definitely distraught as she dealt with insecurities of being financially defunct, her mother passing away a month prior, her odd new guardian, and strange things happening to her [moving framed pictures and voices in her room].  I never got the sense she was insane; just tense. Emily did lose a bit of control at the end when she verbally attacked Nancy; I didn't take too much offense in that, although I probably should have.

Jane Willoughby: This is Emily's mother's best friend and she got under my skin right from the start.  Her Minnesota voice was out of place I felt and the strange lingo of ""What's cooking?"" irritated me to the fact that I avoided her if I could.

Richard Topham: Spitting image of John O'Hurley http://images.playbill.com/photo/o/h/ohurleycue200.jpg  and the resident ESP paranormal psychic that continues to practice on the grounds.  He was close colleagues with Josiah Crowley, the eccentric rich man who owned the Lilac Inn and is now the direct benefactor of the will that is now being contested.  I thought it a little arrogant to have him infer I needed to pass a test in order to converse with him, but I also found it fascinating since I aced it!

Jim Archer: This banker was my #1 suspect, because there was something about his financial dealings he won't making clear to me and he seemed friendly in a bizarre way.

Carson Drew/Bess:  This was the most grown up I have ever heard from Nancy's dad as compared to the later versions where he sounds less gruff and slightly younger in his views. Bess was the same delight as always.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
Totally different from any of the other ND adventures which is quite obvious. I didn't say it was an excellent score necessarily, but I give HER points for bringing out the era's style.  Graphics were decent, though learned nothing new about the era except perhaps the roadster and black/white photos of the early 20th century after the first World war.  Sound effects and detail of the ladder being sprung in the barn were fantastic.  The businesses and residents of Titusville were hugely entertaining as you delivered telegrams in the adventure. I loved Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farms, haha

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 86

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The golf game was strangely not as fun as I would have imaged, although I loved the golfball color challenge. Also not as enjoyable as I thought was the conversation cue ESP test. It took me a long time to integrate the sentences Richard spoke with the traditional card symbols. The Hobo puzzle was easy and okay. I like the test in the parlor involving the slider Shakespeare characters.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 86

ADVENTURE ENDING: I wasn't totally compelled with the plotline, but I wouldn't necessarily say I was bored neither. Thank God that the telegrams weren't a required evil the entire time as that would have made the game extremely tedious.

CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 87

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me three days [9 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 75

My Strong Points: The games were completed at a steady pace and I rarely needed help from the walkthrough although I had trouble finding out where to continue the adventure after being derailed mentally sometimes.

My Weak Points: I did not guess the culprit!!!  I didn't think I was that off-base, but I WAS so I have to give HER a bit of credit for stumping me [something they hadn't done in the last seven adventures thus far].

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: Cracking the Top Ten says a lot for a Franchise that is pushing to get its first A level type game, but at least we know that HER is trying to stretch its boundaries. Good Job and keep going!

In ""Message in a Haunted Mansion"" they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasn't horrifying.

Story-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that she's renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.

Graphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.

Sound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.

Gameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.

Length-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.

Overall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.

Experts advise us to do the same with WinVISTA - yet I do not think this is ever gonna happen...

WinVISTA is far WORSE than the initial release of WinXP: NUMEROUS and MAJOR compatibility problems with most third-party Software, Games (well, all games except...HALO2), GFX-Cards, Scanners & Printers, Cameras & USB-Peripherals. Not to mention Microsoft Software!

Even MICROSOFT Software (such as STREETS & TRIPS 2007, ENCARTA 2007, PICTURE-IT or MONEY 2007) refuses to work with WinVISTA! If they did not care to support their own Software, why should anyone else! And all this trouble just for the cool Aero effect (which, by the way, may be NOT supported on your 2007 PC!) and DirectX10 (for which, you do know, there is not one affordable GFX-card compatible with?)?
I don't think so!

Windows is an OPERATING SYSTEM! Why is it pretending to be able to DO EVERYTHING? It canNOT! Sure, it is nice to be able to listen to music, burn CDs, browse the Internet. But that is why there are so many Specialized Software available! And, what is even worse, WinVISTA will not let exactly these Software titles function as intended!

The first 3 times I tried to install it the installation simply froze in the middle and I had to shut down my system to get it to work again. The 4th time I was able to load the software and then it asked me to insert the bonus CD which comes with WinDVD - the CD authoring software - and extra audio, video clips. The moment WinDVD started to install on my system it tried to delete some files which caused a fatal system error and I got blue screened. I began again the next day, I installed the software again and did not put in the bonus CD as suggested.

The software is easy to work with, it can convert your DV tapes to digital media or you can edit your digital media. It's easy to drop in your video clips, drag in audio and use transitions. You may not able to use your computer for much else while editing unless you have a very powerful system. However, once you're done editing, it can be very frustrating to go through the authoring process.

My system keeps freezing repeatedly and it becomes really difficult to create a DVD from this software most times.

One would think it would be the same thing, but it's not. 2012 is easier on my system. I immediately noticed how much faster Internet Explorer runs. I've been using Firefox because Internet Explorer was so sluggish. I thought it was all the browser's fault. Apparently, the 2011 version causes Internet Explorer to slow down. My IE is still not as fast as Firefox, but much better than before.

As for the virus protection, I'm quite satisfied with the performance of Total Protection, which is why I continue to use McAfee. For many years, my husband did not use McAfee, and he was constantly being infected while mine was virus-free. I finally installed Total Protection on his computer. We haven't had much problems since, except for the interval last year when he went without protection for a few days after the subscription expired and he immediately picked up a virus.

If you are wondering whether to install McAfee Total Protection or Mcafee All Access For Pc Mac and Mobile, I'd go with McAfee Total Protection if you are only protecting home computers. It's less expensive, and you'll ultimately get the same software on your computer. If you are also protecting tablets and cell phones, then All Access is better. All Access will protect tablets, cell phones, netbooks, notebooks and PCs. All Access will also enable a user to remotely wipe out date from cell phones and tablets.

The reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 (the first time I've done that with this series) is because there are several places where what you have to do to move on is illogical, and for these same areas, there isn't any hints to let you know what to do.  As a result, I wound up having to consult ""UHS Hints"" (a really good website where you can find hints to all the Nancy Drew games) a lot more than I would have liked...

""Shadow Ranch"" is situated in the Arizona Desert - and the graphics of this area are great!  The mystery surrounds strange happenings that are occuring on the ranch - such as a phantom horse riding through at night, always accompanied by a major mishap at the ranch (a snake bite, power lines become downed, pump house floods).

Nancy finds out early in the game that there are rumors about an old bank robber who had hidden a treasure for his sweetheart - who used to live at the ranch.  So your job, as Nancy Drew, teen detective, is to 1. find out who or what is behind all of the strange mishaps - are they linked to the phantom horse, or does it just appear that way?  And 2. find the treasure - if there is one...

In order to get around the desert, you get to ride a horse - be sure to look around at everything you can find about riding horses before you begin, or you just might find yourself falling off a lot!!!

Overall, I found this game to be fun to play, although it did become quite frustrating at times...  If you find yourself having difficulty as I did, I'd recommend going to the ""UHS hints"" website - they allow you to choose how many hints to take, and you can always get a few before you're given the full answer - this way, if you just need a push in the right direction, you don't have to see the full answer and ruin the fun of figuring out for yourself.",Another Good Game!,1134864000,13.0,

I have also done remarkable graphics work from Corel PhotoPaint and CorelDraw for years too, often having rave comments from other graphic artists who assumed I had been using Photoshop or Illustrator.

I had lost track of WordPerfect for a while, but with the X6 package, am amazed at how superior this product is compared to the Office Products that I had been forced to use due to computer issues.  What a breath of fresh air to be using WordPerfect Office instead.  I was hoping to have some problems to warn about or pointers to give, but so far, it is pretty easy and problem free for me!

So far, I have not had any problems translating files from Corel to Microsoft file formats, nor have I had problems reading files sent to me from the newer Microsoft programs.

The Quattro Pro spreadsheet program was great too- easy to use and follow.

The templates are helpful and useful as well.  I have used several of them when I am in a hurry and don't know what else to do.

The help files are all searchable online now so it is easier to access instead of having to pull out a manual.  I will say that the search engine is not always the greatest so you might have to play around with words until you find what you want.

I am still working on exploring all of the program that I can, as it is really enjoyable to use and work with.

I will continue to update as I learn more about the program and if I run into any problems worth mentioning.

I am using this currently with Windows XP but plan on transferring it to my Windows 7 machine I am putting together soon and will update with my experiences there as well.

As with all of the Corel choices, the price point alone makes it amazing, but the ease of use and lack of problems I have had so far make it truly worth taking a look at.

Get 2002 or 2000, as 2003 (especially in Outlook) is very annoying.  The latter also removes backwards compatibility UNLESS you download the UnlockExcel.reg and UnlockWord.reg files from MS (free download).  And, be sure not to accept the MS Office 2003 bizillion updates for alleged problems.  Again, 2002 and prior are a better buy (more customizable, more add-ins, nicer), unless you have some specific need for 2003.

Rest of the review follows below, without further edit.

UPDATE 9/9/12: This review is long and unwieldy, sorry; it covers not only the upgrade version listed here; but also, this review compares full versions of Office 2003 and prior.  I'll be editing this review ad hoc, too.  The problem here is the LACK OF BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY imposed by later versions of Windows or Office.  So it becomes very complicated, to explain the variant problems with different MS versions of Office, and how to make them work.  If you have older files, you have to deal with these complex problems.  Hence this review:  it's mind-boggling.  MS has now made computing far more difficult than necessary.

According to Windows 7 Compatibility advisor, Office 2002 and prior are NOT compatible with Windows 7.  But according to users in the PC World forums, you can still use Office 2000-2002, especially Word and Excel, but might have problems with Outlook 2000, IF IF IF you configured it to run your email (the email passwords won't store, when Outlook 2000 is run from Win7 OS).  Google for PC World Office 2000, 2002 and for Windows 7.  Replace 'PC World' with 'MS Answers Forums' to see the same issues discussed in MS Answers Forums.  Pity that MS won't support its own products, when the newer versions of the same products, are worse.

SHORT SUMMARY: The #1 reason to buy this older (pre-2003) software, now that it's outdated -- is for backwards-compatibility.  And, some of its older functions work better than in Word 2003 et seq.  And, if you migrate to Win 7, you'll lose Outlook Express (one of the few stable and good programs MS has written, so OF COURSE they get rid of it).  So you'll have to learn Microsoft Outlook, anyway.  This matters most, because Outlook after version 2000, stinks.  Your other alternative will be SmartSuite version 9.8 and prior, from IBM.  Those versions are also backwards-compatible.  Latest SmartSuite might not be able to read DOS files from Win7, IBM told me.  But SmartSuite itself, is able to run in Win7, per MS' own listing of 'compatible' programs.  So try buying here in Amazon, earlier versions of SmartSuite, which run between $6 - $50 (versions 9.8 and prior).  I'm testing those, so am writing reviews of SmartSuite as well (review is still in progress).  The latest version of SmartSuite can only be purchased at IBM, so far as I can tell, but it's still called version 9 (but is later than the versions sold here at Amazon).  The latest version costs about $400, so you'd be smart to get an earlier version here in Amazon, see if you like it.

For later versions of Word (or SmartSuite) can read Word 2000-2002 files, as well as files in other older programs for Windows (SmartSuite can read more older files, even from DOS).

Why is that important?  These older Windows programs thus become BRIDGE programs to enable later MS software to read word processing and spreadsheet software which is PRE-2000.  In short, you open those older files in Word/Excel 2000-2002, and then CONVERT them into Word/Excel 2000-2002.  At which point, later MS software can work with the same file.  Else, it's toast. So if you have many old files, you need Office XP 2000 or 2002, as a 'bridge' back to your old files.  So now the question:  WHICH?  2000, or 2002?  No simple answer. Depends on what Office products you're using now, and whether you use Acrobat. The rest of this review is on these complex questions.

WARNING:  Windows 7 will not work with Outlook 2000.  Lots of complaints about that, in MS Answers forums.  Problem with passwords;  they won't store in Outlook 2000, when operated in Windows 7, because Windows 7 no longer allows you to use email directly from your computer;  you have to use it in conjunction with Windows Live mail -- a horrible thing.  (Why MS keeps on wrecking its own older-but-good features, is beyond my comprehension.)

So if you're planning to use Outlook 2000 in Windows 7, DO NOT install it with email enabled.  Maybe then it will work in Windows 7, because people have told me they can get Office 2000 to work even in Windows 8, but without Outlook email enabled.  So maybe you can install it and only in the new Windows version, enable email?  I don't know, but it's worth a shot.

====== OFFICE 2000 versus 2002 ======

Office 2000 works best in Win98SE and XP Home.  Office 2002 runs better in XP Professional; because the service packs convert Office 2000 into Word 2002 -- with bugs. So if like I did, you then reinstall 2000 to get rid of the bugs, the reinstallation conflicts with the updates. So that problem is solved if you upgrade to Office version 2002.

BUT BEWARE:  select CUSTOM installation of 2002. If you're on Windows XP Professional OS, DO NOT UPGRADE OUTLOOK 2000 to 2002.  So don't install Outlook 2002, if you're using Outlook 2000.  That's what I did (see last three paragraphs of this review).

====== OUTLOOK 2000 versus later editions ======

Outlook 2000 still beats the competing PIM and other calendar management software 'out there' for Windows, if you have a lot of recurring events in your year, i.e., you are an tax accountant, actuary, tax lawyer who deals with annual IRS deadlines.  Outlook is too much hassle to use, unless you have a lot of legal or other deadlines which you must track annually.  Same would be said if you are a buyer or supplier of regular shipments.  Buggy and cumbersome though Outlook is, once you properly set it up for recurring events/appointments, they keep on going forever.  Holidays, not so good: the list is stale-dated after a few years;  it's a hassle to go to MS to update your holidays, but they do provide updated lists (current one runs 2007-2012).  I just don't use them, have a paper calendar for that stuff.

Here's how I use it:  your usage will of course differ, but you can tell the PATTERN, and then adapt for your needs.  Key here is RECURRING DEADLINES.  Everyone has recurring deatlines.  Outlook shines in that respect.  So (as stated again below), a) I keep a thin wireback 8.5 x 11 paper calendar for basics on holidays, and workload planning.  Easy to store in the files, easier then to get a sense of where to look for stuff in Outlook.  Next, b) I programmed legal deadlines in Excel based on the client year end, because in pensions you end up having six or seven separate deadlines a month, centering around the 15th  and the end of the month, based on the Plan or client fiscal year end.  It's a nightmare.  So that master list of deadlines based on year end, helps a great deal.  Finally, c) in Outlook I then plotted a generic calendar by year end, so the deadlines show as 'events' in my calendar each day, week, month.  So Outlook is a glorified alarm clock.  Hassle to program, but easier than using a PDA or cellphone.  (Sidekick is next best, but you can't really run it properly in a DOS window, after Win98SE.)

A client is likewise an 'event' keyed to that particular year end.  Because in my business, the penalties are high for missing deadlines.  IRS almost always forgives the penalty if you've good reason for being late, but no one wants to go through that angst.  Hopefully this paragraph gave you ideas you can extrapolate for your own usage.

You might want to know about printing.  You can print any configuration you'll likely want, but remember that the longer the timeline per print job, the smaller the font needs to be, and the harder it will be to get decent output.  Daily, weekly, monthly works well.  A whole year can be done, but it's not useful.  You can configure the day/week/month with filters to create a blank calendar.  But that will cost you more time than if you just bought one.

Frankly, you'll waste time to print calendars.  The minute you print them, you'll find something you need to change.  So better to go paperless, if you need something to distribute: for this, you print to pdf.  Lots of good pdf printers out there, and you probably already have one on your machine.  My favorite is Smart PDF Creator Pro, but I also have Acrobat 9 (the latter creates the smallest file size of any pdf print program I've seen).  So you 'print' to the pdf printer on your machine, saving paper, time and guilt when you find, five seconds later, that the format is screwy or you left something out.  Outlook also exports to devices:  here it might matter that you use Outlook 2003, depending on your device.  Many more devices are configured to interface with Outlook, than with the other PIM software 'out there'.  It's usually a hassle to set up the first few times, because the names in your device don't match the names in Outlook, so you go through trial-and-error finding out which OUTLOOK names 'port' to your device.  But in the end, it is worth the effort.

Frankly, the old At-A-Glance monthly or weekly calendars are great.  But the problem is, if you have a lot of complicated recurring items you'll later need to SEARCH for, the paper method is no good.  So I keep paper for just the basics (like holidays and planning out my workload), but record the details in Outlook.  Stuff done stays in Outlook forever if you want it to, and you can archive anything for any period, manually or automatically (pick manual, never trust MS automated anything).

Outlook 2000 is the best version.  It's 'views' are very configurable;  it's extremely buggy (as is true of all MS products), but is better than later versions of Outlook. On XP Home, Outlook 2002 will 'obey' the Outlook 2000 settings you have, but you lose future 'view' configurability.  Outlook 2003 will not recognize the Outlook 2000 settings on XP Home; nor will Outlook 2002 on XP Professional OS.  I don't know whether the settings will be recognized on Win7, since I won't upgrade to that terrible, new OS.  (Win 7 is still VISTA, but with some corrections.)

Outlook 2000 can display custom-sized and positioned units, all on the same 'page': tasks, calendar, etc.  For example, you can widen or narrow dimensions;  say, Notes and Tasks alongside a daily or weekly calendar.  Again, THE reason to get Outlook, is its ability to set recurring events, and link them to notes, tasks, and journalling.  Bugs all have workarounds.  Since this is software you'd use daily, you'll get used to the workarounds.

(Old Borland Sidekick, and the old Lotus Metro were less buggy, but also less configurable.  Forget WordPerfect's PIM.  All business contact management software, stinks.  Been there, done that, have the war wounds.)

By contrast, Outlook 2002 (in XP Pro) et seq. only allow one view at a time, Calendar OR Notes OR Tasks. You must open new windows to view, say, Notes and/or Tasks alongside each other; of course you must resize the windows each time. So you're constantly stuck with moving them around.

In short, the last viable version of Outlook, is 2000.  Part of its viability ports over when you upgrade in 2002 in XP Home; but only data is ported over for Outlook 2003, which is utterly dysfunctional.  For example, your 'contacts' begin with REAMS of BLANKS, and there is no option for NAME fields.  What drunk designed that ????  The only way you can deal with it is to sort DESCENDING, or GUESS how many BLANKS you must first delete before you can reach the 'A' in contacts.  God forbid you click on any of the letters (which are supposed to be address-book-tabs), and above all don't click on 123, because then you can't sort at all -- well, until you leave 'Contacts', at which point when you return, your names are necessarily bass-ackwards.  But at least then you can see how many BLANKS you have to delete, and then reset sort to ascending.  Still, you can't organize FIELDS in Contacts.  Oh, wait -- you can specify the fields, but you can't SEE them, and there is no 'current view' available listing NAMES first.  None of this hassle applied in older versions of Outlook.  Unbelievable.

But finally, Outlook 2003 allows you to specify a certain folder to open on startup (i.e., your calendar, instead of that useless Outlook Today with too much white space and no configurability).  In Outlook 2000, you specify this by selecting Tools Options Other Advanced Options button, then pick what you want to display at startup from the drop-down box. (Sorry for the arcane step names.  Clarity is not, an MS forte.)

Outlook 2003 imposes problems when editing tasks, i.e., the highlighter seems to be on one task though you've clicked on a different one, so you'll think you delete the HIGHLIGHTED one; but instead you deleted the task on which your CURSOR (not mouse), resides.

Something must be wrong with the water, in Redmond WA.

Outlook 2002 et seq, FORCE TWO LINES OF ICONS.  You can't uncheck that Options box. When installing In XP Professional, it crashes, then tells you it can't use your prior version settings or your store, would you like to use the default. If you say no, the program quits. If you say yes, it wipes out your prior settings, and you have to do them all over: that's a week's work.

Same 'week' cost is true for Outlook 2000, but when you get it configured rightly, it's a decent program;  it has a nice PDA transfer capability, is easy to import and export to other formats.

====== PHOTO EDITOR 2000 versus later editions ======

DO NOT UPGRADE THE PHOTO EDITOR, either.  The 2000 version is much more full-featured.  The 2002 replacement isn't bad, but it's not as good as the year 2000 version.

====== OTHER OFFICE PROGRAMS (excepting Word and Excel) ======

Business Contact Manager, Front Page, Power Point and Access are useless programs, all glitch and no gain.  You might need Access, though, as many other non-MS programs, use its structure and features.  MS Power Point can result in a pretty slide show, but in Windows Movie Maker you can do more, and more easily.  (Pity Microsoft is so short-sighted, it won't modernize WMM.  MS is losing profits, by not modernizing it.  Again, the MS programs that are actually USEFUL, get scant MS attention.  The programs we NEED to be useful as well but are so buggy you itch for a gun, are 'upgraded' to be more buggy, still.)

Document Imaging and Scanning is marginally better in Office 2002, can be quite useful.  The default tiff file is easy to manipulate, small in size, and most older scanners can thus 'talk' to MS Document Imaging (i.e., the Brother line of MFC).  You have to tweak the MS settings each time; but especially for older scanners and files, these programs are a godsend.  They are somewhat easier to use than Acrobat and PaperPort, but operate along much the same lines.  Like MS, Acrobat is phasing out backwards-compatibility.

====== WORD and EXCEL 2000 and 2002 versus later editions ======

Acrobat can't work with Word post-2002, though it claims compatibility.  It can't work with Word 2000, per its own website (see my review on Acrobat 9, here in Amazon.)

So that leaves Word 2002 and Excel 2002.  GET THEM, if you ever used Win98SE or even Win 3.1 -- and thus have old computer files from that time and prior.  Office 2002 is the last MS version to support backwards compatibility with the powerhouse software of yesteryear (Word Perfect, Quattro Pro, Lotus 1-2-3, Ami, etc).  Later versions ELIMINATE backwards-compatibility; and worse, impose a 'restriction policy' you can't override without screaming (see my review of Word 2003 in Amazon).

So you will need Office 2002 or 2000 to READ older files.  Moreover, older software CANNOT SEARCH the drive. WordPerfect through X5 cannot search its own files on a disk.  Only can search its own files within a directory of a disk.  Windows, by contrast, can't read WordPerfect files to search for text.  This was not a problem in 98SE, but is a problem now.  So if you don't have some 'bridge' software that CAN read those old files, you're stuck.

If you're on XP Professional OS, then old spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3 wk1's, must be converted via an older version of Excel; to enable a later version of Excel, to read the file.  In XP Home (but NOT Professional), Office 2003's Excel CAN read Lotus 1-2-3 files, but later versions of Excel, cannot;  because, in later versions, the wk1 format is deemed dangerous, and you can't fix the Excel default to accept that format.  So, you'd have to convert the wk1 to an Excel format. This is especially true, if you want your family/friends/clients to read wk1 files.

Any version of Office is mediocre, buggy; what automation they should allow, they prohibit.  What automation they impose, wrecks your work. For example, DEFAULTS at installation involve 'autoformat' and 'update style', which on the surface, sound harmless and even beneficial. But if you don't spend hours examining and unchecking these and other defaults prior to creating an important document, you'll have regrets.

Example: say you install, didn't check the defaults, and start to write a document. You create bulleted lists. When you've reached page 18, you decide to reformat the indentation and type of bullets on THAT page.  YOU think you're only changing the format of the latest bullet list.  Surprise surprise -- ALL your previous bulleted lists, ALSO changed to CONFORM to your latest 'auto update style'.

So everything's bass-ackwards with MS software:  before you do anything, you must carefully review every default setting, and figure out how to change it.

So TURN OFF ALL AUTOMATED FUNCTIONS just after installation.  Before you create any document, call up each program and examine its Options and Customize and Autoformat.  It will take all day to figure out what you must turn off or on. Then hit the SAVE (floppy disk) icon to save, without naming the document/spreadsheet.  For that first document/spreadsheet which comes up, is the DEFAULT.  Word's default is Normal.dot, and Excel's default is Book1.xls.  But you won't see the former's name when you open Word;  instead, it labels as Doc1.doc;  but it IS, Normal.dot.  So make your changes to the Options (including Color, for Excel), then hit the SAVE (floppy disk) icon to save it IN the default.

So always have a backup copy before you edit in Word or Excel 2002.  Never trust that what you edited, was all that changed.  Read the entire document over.

What about their vaunted templates?  Yecccch.  And what if you design one of your own?  Well, here's the problem: you can't SEE the formatting so if you backspace, you just wiped it out.  Thankfully, there's 'Reveal Formatting' (in 'Format' menu, or separately moveable as an icon -- tricky thing to create it).  So if your Formatting is REVEALED (by a frame on the right side of your document) -- as you type, you can see what formatting is used for that line.  This is far better than Word Perfect's stupid Reveal Codes, but the latter at least smartly warns if you're deleting a 'style' or 'format'; or (at least in WP 9) flat presumes you only mean to delete text.  Now if only WP would get rid of auto-formatting for a printer hooked up to your system...

Word is not so smart.  It could be MADE to be smart, if they souped up their current option to 'show formatting marks' to INCLUDE the style identifiers.  So you can't see the STYLE, except via Reveal Formatting' frame at right of your document.

It is easy to change and add styles, but spend the hour or two it takes to figure out how to add those styles to Normal.dot, because a changed style only 'stays' with the document you edit.  Same problem is true for Excel, but Excel allows you to always COPY to and from Book1.xls, as you work.  This matters a bunch, for MS default colors are egregious.  In Excel but not Word, you can change the colors, save them to Book1.xls, and then 'copy' them into whatever other worksheet you later open.  Else, any colors you change (using Tools Options Color tab), are only good for that worksheet and maybe for that SESSION.  (It's quirky: sometimes my Tools Options Colors modifications for a worksheet; save; and sometimes not, though I always go through the same steps, and have been doing this for years.)

=== OTHER TIPS ===

A.  In Word, check the box in General tab which asks to be prompted to update the default template, 'Normal.dot'.  Else, any changes you make in program function (i.e., icons or options), won't be preserved once you close the program.  Similarly, if you goofed up your settings during a session, when prompted to update at close program, you can select 'no'; thus your goofups won't be saved. :)

B.  Word is notorious for not enabling underlined blanks.  So to make blank underlined spaces, select Tools Options, then select the Compatibility tab, and check off 'draw underline on trailing spaces'.  Then hit the 'default' button at lower right, and click Yes.  You've just enabled underlined blanks in all future documents. To enable them in past documents: repeat the foregoing steps, after having opened each such other document.  The other way to do it, is to tap out your spaces, end them with punctuation, then paint UP TO the punctuation mark you made.  Word will then draw the underline -- BECAUSE that punctuation mark is on the same line.  Weird.

C.  Comments in Word are incredibly stupid.  You're better off making footnotes or endnotes or objects, since you can optionally hide these from printing.  Bookmarks are a great alternative, since you can bookmark a section, so when the person clicks on it, can be redirected to the comment on some page not to be printed, then use the 'Web' Menu's back or forward buttons, to return back to where he was reading.  Comments in Excel are even more stupid, and no matter how you set them, a) you can't set a DEFAULT NOTE STYLE so are stuck with the ungainly defaults the stupid programmers impose; b) every time you load the worksheet, when you go to EDIT the comments, your comment on edit might be MILES AWAY from the cell (though anchored to the cell, properly readable as a comment).  I've spent hours slowly moving some edited comment which is anchored, say, to column E, but when opened for edit is somehow suddenly the size of a thin line, and way over in column FN, where no worksheet cells are active.  Doesn't matter whether you set the comment to move and resize with the cell, or move but not resize (no reason NOT to move the comment for a cell).  Each single comment must be individually formatted, but all formatting options are available.

D. In Excel, to make the Print Preview show color, select a PDF printer in Page Setup, and make sure that 'black and white' is NOT checked in Page Setup Sheet tab.  This enables you to print to pdf file, and keep the colors.  A black-and-white printer will print colors as shades, anyway.  So you don't need to do anything special.  (Older printers couldn't print shades, so the 'black-and-white' option in Page Setup Sheet is something of a holdover.  Any laser printer I've worked with, naturally recognizes color as a shade of gray.  If you have a color printer, generally you won't want to print black-and-white, either, as black ink is more expensive for color printers.)

E.  Editing text in Excel actually allows you full formatting options.  Edit in the formula bar, and when you want to bold or color or highlight only a specific portion of the text, then do it like you would in Word: select the text then pick whatever formatting you want to apply to the selection.  You can also conditionally format cells, but it's buggy and limited.  3-D type function is easy enough, where in one tab you reference another worksheet by tab name -- what's hard, is that the instructions don't make it clear, how to do this.  It's TABNAME!Cellname  -- be sure to include the exclamation.  Cellname can be either a named range or an address.  If a named range, be sure you've allowed 'accept labels in formulas', in the Tools Options Calculation tab. This is especially important if you're importing a spreadsheet with named ranges (i.e., from Lotus 1-2-3).  If you don't allow those 'labels', ALL YOUR NAMED RANGES ARE CONVERTED TO CELL ADDRESSES INSTEAD, AND YOU CANNOT RENAME THEM.  So says Excel help.  I've not tested that warning for accuracy.

F.  Else, in either 2000 or 2002, the footnotes, endnotes, section headers, table of contents, etc. are cumbersome but useful.  The 'styles' are quirky;  sometimes a backspace while working on a document, undoes or changes the style to something bizarre.  Bookmarks are handy. Customize your icons, to save time later.  In Word/Excel 2002, they insanely group the icons so that too much space is used.  So to end that problem, you must move the icons around to make them fit in the top window line (next to 'Help');  then, fit the rest of the icons so that they only take up ONE line. This fixing, takes hours.  Again, the stupid DEFAULTS pay no attention to customer need, usage, or even common sense.

G.  Word can't merge well with a database.  Comma-delimited or a text file is all it really knows.  But WordPerfect, is even more cumbersome and glitchy.  After years of trying to get either program to merge well, I fell back to my old DOS Multimate Advantage II.  I use old DOS Sidekick on a 486, to create a paste file which then runs the merge.  There ought to be a way to do the same thing in either Word or WordPerfect, but I've not found it.  (IBM's SmartSuite version 9.8 backwards, claim to enable real merging with a named range in a spreadsheet, even with DOS Lotus 1-2-3.  I'm testing that claim, now.  Will post its results in my SmartSuite review here in Amazon.)

====== SUMMARY AND INSTALLATION TIPS ======

SUMMING UP: On the whole, Office 2002 or 2000 is good enough for basic functions like a letter or a simple spreadsheet; for pretty colors but minimal functionality. Excel's ability to do complex calculations -- especially with dates -- is awful. However -- very ironic -- if you programmed the functions in DOS Lotus 1-2-3, the pre-2003 versions of Excel recognize them correctly, and suddenly can handle dates and other complex calculations.  In short, to make Exel really excel, you need DOS Lotus.  (Oddly, Lotus Release 3-5 for Windows, can't handle these calculations well.  SmartSuite did seem to recognize/calculate the functions correctly, when I uploaded a DOS Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet into SmartSuite version 9.6 and 9.1.)

Hence the need for Office 2002 or 2000, in order to 'read' your wk1 files, and make Excel, useful.  (Years ago I begged IBM to re-release DOS Lotus 1-2-3 -- they own its rights, now -- and never got an answer.  So the only way you can get DOS 1-2-3 version 2.x, is to buy it from the secondary market, i.e., some 'vintage software' warehouse.  Check here in Amazon, maybe someone's selling it.)

Again, Office 2002 runs more smoothly than 2000, in XP Pro;  but Outlook in 2002 is inflexible, compared to the 2000 version.  There are also more add-ins created for 2000.  Another flipside: 2002 is compatible with Acrobat 9 and X, but 2000 is not.  Not to worry: buy Smart PDF Creator Pro, which can what Adobe can do for a much lower price; and will work with these older MS Office programs.  So I just use Smart PDF Creator Pro with pre-2002 MS Office (and anything else).

Also, get the CONVERTERS, so that 2002 (or 2000) can read and use LATER versions of Word and Excel (like xlsx and docx extensions).  The converters do work.  Google on fileconverters.exe , to get the download from Microsoft.  That's its program name.

So now you're looking at a hybrid installation, Word 2002 and Excel 2002, but older versions of Outlook and Photo. On XP Pro OS, I installed Office 2003, over 2000; then uninstalled 2003, because it's so clunky and dysfunctional; then installed 2002; then uninstalled Outlook 2002, then reinstalled ONLY Outlook 2000 (to a different directory).  Works well, and all my overrides of the defaults, still work.  Will do the same for Photo 2000, later.  I always prefer the full version of the software to upgrades.  I hope you know, that even the upgrade version IS a full version.  But then you might have copyright concerns later.  Best to buy each 'upgrade' as a full version, so you can continue to separately use the old version, on some other machine.  Here, you've seen how that might be needful.

Alternative is to have one machine with 2000, and the other with 2002.  So my XP Pro machine, has the above hybrid;  my XP Home OS netbook, still has Office 2003; which was installed over Office 2000.  My other XP Home desktop, has Office 2002 installed over 2000.  And an old Win98SE laptop, still has 2000.  In short, to assure backwards-compatibility, I have multiple computers from 286 forward;  these run on DOS, Win98SE, XP.  And in case I need it, I have the older programs, too -- like Lotus, Multimate, Word Perfect, Word 97, etc.  Still have Win95 OS, too.  Even, Win 3.1 and 3.11.

This way, you can read files from older software going all the way back to the 1980's.  You know: when Noah was born. :)",BUY for backwards-compatibility with older computer files,1344556800,,

The moment WinDVD started to install on my system it tried to delete some files which caused a fatal system error and I got blue screened. I began again the next day, I installed the software again and did not put in the bonus CD as suggested.

The software is easy to work with, it can convert your DV tapes to digital media or you can edit your digital media. It's easy to drop in your video clips, drag in audio and use transitions. You may not able to use your computer for much else while editing unless you have a very powerful system. However, once you're done editing, it can be very frustrating to go through the authoring process.

I edit a consumer technology website so I feel very comfortable reviewing this product. Unfortunately, I can't give Microsoft Streets and Trips more than a lukewarm recommendation.

Let's start with the installation of the the software. The installer program on the included DVD-ROM is easily confused by other startup applications ... so don't try to install this software until all of your Windows startup applications (antivirus, wireless assistants, etc.) have finished loading. Even a single background application can throw off the installation.

Once installed, the trip planning software works fine, but you can do the same thing faster, easier, and for free using Google Maps or Yahoo Maps online. The overall Streets and Trips software interface isn't very intuitive so expect to stumble around trying to figure out how it works the first few times you try to use it.

Once you're able to get the GPS receiver to lock onto satellites and provide directions, things don't get much better. The spoken turn-by-turn directions aren't always clear, and because of the weak GPS receiver (more on that later) you don't always get the verbal directions when you need them.

The included GPS receiver/USB dongle is large but doesn't provide very good reception. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio (a reasonably large US city) and half the time I cannot get the GPS receiver to lock onto a satellite. My Garmin nuvi 360 handheld GPS gets better satellite reception, is easier to use, and the spoken directions are easier to understand. The only major advantage to The Microsoft Streets and Trips software/GPS receiver combo is that you can install it on a laptop so you don't have to carry a laptop and a GPS when traveling ... you can just use your laptop. Of course, that's assuming the GPS receiver actually gets a signal and can provide turn-by-turn directions.

The software supposedly gets updates for traffic conditions, but it never seems to know when there's a major construction zone ahead ... even if it's a construction zone that has been there for several months. By comparison, my Garmin GPS almost always knows when I'm about to approach a construction zone and alerts me in advance.

Bottom line, I really can't recommend Microsoft Streets and Trips 2009 with GPS to anyone unless you can't afford a stand-alone GPS device or smartphone with built-in GPS. Yes, I suppose it's nice to be able to navigate using just your laptop in the car, but the weak GPS receiver sort of kills that benefit.","When it works it's OK, but might not be worth the money.",1247702400,4.0,

I've added a star (now at three).  If I was to rate how Turbo worked well for me for many years, I would have given it 4 to 5 stars.  I never had a very complicated filing so others might rate differently.  I rated it 2 to 3 stars now because they've let me down this year.  There is plenty of chaos in the world, so I am happy when there is stability and reliability in something, especially MY MONEY!  I've switched to H&R Block.

Over time, Turbo has gradually ratcheted up their price which I could have lived with.  Instead of paying the usual $50 (everywhere you look) for Deluxe, I would wait until about now and buy at a Club store or on Amazon if there was a deal for about $40.

As I read about the changes this year, I got concerned.  I don't think I would really have a problem with this year's version, but what if I did!  I think H&R Block saw an opening and I bought it for about $16 from Amazon.  Why not try it this year?  I see that Turbo has ""backtracked"" on the extra charges.  But, it's too late for me.  Who wants the extra aggravation trying to get your money back?  If H&R works ok for me this year, I won't be returning to Turbo unless they're giving it away!

Turbo is made by Intuit, the SAME company that makes Quicken.  Intuit means ""understand or work out by instinct"".  This is not always the case with either Turbo or Quicken.  Like Turbo, I used Quicken for many, many years.  Every year, they'd come out with a new version, apparently just to generate revenue.  They would totally change the GUI (kind of like what Turbo does).  They would introduce so many errors that it would take the rest of the year to fix them.  Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and simply use my bank's ""on-line banking"" function which is free, saving me $10 a month AND the cost of the yearly upgrade.

At least Turbo doesn't seem very buggy.  However, they do do ""dumb"" things, like always printing Estimated Tax forms for the next year.  They're never correct because Turbo doesn't know about other income I may have the following year.  But, okay.  I just throw away 4 sheets of paper.  I also don't like having to clear a screen every time I start where they want to know if I want to buy more Turbo service.

Please note: I had previously installed the more basic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. This Office Professional 2013 version was for installation on a PC that had been upgraded to Windows 8.1, so it was initially more of an experiment than anything. Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office Professional 2013 suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.

 Likes:

+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless
+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed
+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email
+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed
+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way

 Rants & Irritants:

- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat

 Installation:

The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.

Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher or the other components, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.

What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.

 SkyDrive:

I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office Professional and the other Office 2013 variants, and it has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.

 Word:

The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.

Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.

 Excel:

On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.

But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, and restoring the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.

 OneNote:

This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.

 PowerPoint:

There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.

 Outlook:

There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible, and it seems to be working.

 Publisher:

I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office Professional, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.

 Access:

The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have only accessed this module a few times for conversion of some older files... and pardon the pun.

 Annoyances & Irritants:

My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the ""new"" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.

 Suggestions:

Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. This version was for installation on a PC that had recently been upgraded to Windows 8.1, and my installation went smoothly. It works well, though your results may differ from mine.

One of the other Office suites may be better suited to your needs.

Currently I'll rate this suite at a solid 5-star product that can easily be recommended on the Windows 8 or 8.1 platforms.

I found it just right.
When I contemplated self-employment, I had several concerns, including whether or not I could actually keep the wolf from the door that way, but my largest was the thought that I would have to keep records of some kind. I don't have a talent for that. When my sixth client sent me a contract, I searched diligently for a book called, say, ""The Smallest Amount of Accounting Knowledge You Need to Avoid Getting Thrown in Jail,"" but didn't find such a thing. All the books I could find seemed to imagine that I was -- well, an accountant.
Office Accounting Professional 2008 doesn't assume this. It is bossy software.
You know what I mean about bossy software. It reminds you to apply payments to invoices and nags you about putting in people's names correctly and won't let you charge people for ""June.""
In general, I don't like bossy software. Bossy word processing programs often just don't understand complex syntax and don't have as large a vocabulary as I do, and I really don't need my computer to warn me that I haven't been properly introduced to websites.
But the bossiness of this software means that someone like me can put her data in correctly enough to send it off to the accountant -- and there is a system for doing that, too.
I scoffed at the set-up poster, by the way, but it was nice to have some large paper showing all the steps in order. I had no trouble getting the software installed, everything was done by wizards, and overall I found the whole package reassuring.
Now, I have no employees, and I have no interest in eBay, so I sympathize with those who felt that there were more parts to this than they needed. However, I found that this package has just the amount of power I need for keeping track of hours, jobs, clients, income, and expenditure. If I have employees some day, I won't have to learn new software. I can foresee needing to use the banking features, so I'm glad they're there. The extra features don't hamper my use of what I currently need, and I've had the experience before of spending more on trading up than I would have if I'd bought something more powerful to begin with.
I would strongly recommend this package for small businesses.","Not for everyone, but just right for me",1214352000,13.0,

The combination of Microsoft's software, the gps and a netbook makes for an interesting alternative to a dedicated gps unit. There was the moment where I realized that Microsoft's GPS unit would not automatically be configured with Streets and Maps, so I had to do it, which was not difficult, but was also unnecessary.

Getting to the functions you want is easier, and more intuitive.  I don't find myself hunting through menus and boxes to find the changes I want to make.

Also the help functions are soooo much better.  When you do a help search on Microsoft, you basically get a web search for whatever words you entered, with WordPerfect you get actual useful answers and tutorials on how to do what you are trying to do.

Also with WordPerfect you have the option to save files directly to PDF (A Must have nowadays if you ask me) and you have a program called paperport that lets you scan in papers and convert them, a really nice program.

While I am still forced to do much of my work on Word, I find myself more and more using WordPerfect saving and then just converting the files to MS Word or excel.  A little extra work, but still easier then using the Microsoft products.

I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

Each iteration sees improvements and version 11 is no different.  I am someone who prefers typing over dictation, so I am not a heavy user of this product.

My first experience with the Dragon software was probably about ten years ago.  At that early stage voice dictation was more of a novelty than a professional work flow.  Things have improved exponentially since, and this version impressed me with its accurate recognition (after training of course).

Before you get started the software needs to be ""trained"" to your voice.  And while the training process has improved, it will still take some time to get it accurately interpreting your voice.  Account for that during the installation process as it will take an hour or two to get everything tweaked and adjusted.  Is the accuracy perfect?  Definitely not, but it's pretty close.  I tend to be a fast talker but Dragon was able to keep up most of the time.  Corrections are easy too.

For those with repetitive stress injuries or other disabilities, Dragon's software also brings voice control to a number of other functions, including email and search engine queries.  Short queries tend to be very accurate.

Other times, I really need an AutoCAD feature that just isn't included in the LT version.

This last one rankles a bit, because I inevitably have to call the client back and ask them to convert to a format I can handle, or print it themselves.

  Well, just add Norton Internet Security 2008!

  System boot-up times will be extended by a factor of two or three. Just the thing you want when starting up your computer - a nice long wait. A really long wait.

  And if that wasn't enough fun, wait until you launch your web browser. All those hours programmers spent trying to build fast response into their browser creations? Wasted effor. Norton Internet Security 2008 helps your browser pass away minute after minute after minute. You had no better use for your time anyway, did you? Norton Internet Security 2008 will slow your browser to a crawl.

  Norton Internet Security 2008 will interrrupt you at least twice a day (and generally more) with an intrusive pop-up that new updates have been downloaded and that you need to restart your computer. Oh, how nice: they five you an option of being reminded in 1, 12 or 24 hours - but apparently no option to set the update schedule or turn off the annoying pop-ups. Symanytec's program architects certainly think that the user is not only clueless, but their slave as well.

  Symantec has included a ""feature"" they call ""Identity Safe"". Every time you type in a password to a site it launches an annoying pop-up asking if you want to use ""Identity Safe"". You can click on the convenient ""Do not show this window again"" option a thousand times - and it will ignore you a thousand times. Norton Internet Security 2008 also grabs web browser tool bar space, but fortunately you can turn it off.

The BitDefender gives perhaps a slightly better bargain for the buck, partly because it offers very slightly larger features and partly because it provides a year year license while the Trend Micro provides only one.  In fact, comparing the BitDefender with all other security programs, it just might be the best bargain.

The one thing that I don't like about the BitDefender as opposed to the Trend Micro equivalent is that my computer seems to drag a bit downloading some pages compared to the one with Trend Micro.

Apart from the expected map updates, GPS navigation has been upgraded with text to speech capabilities. Unfortunately, it uses a raw Microsoft Anna speech engine, which sounds HORRIBLE. For example, instead of route ""US 51"" the software says ""us 51"" (as in the objective case of ""we""). Same thing with ""SR 51"": the program says ""senior 51"". The intonation is all wrong as well, making it extremely hard to understand (unlike dedicated GPS navigators). Microsoft Anna was never developed with route directions in mind, so I think that MS should have spent some time to adapt it for this software.

BUT, bad text to speech is better than no text to speech at all. For example, you CAN understand highway exit numbers, so if you frequent a lot of highways you'll find the text to speech useful.

Another nice little improvement is automatic rerouting. If you miss a turn from the route, you won't hear Anna repeat ""Off Route"" indefinitely (like in the old edition), but instead it will automatically recalculate a new route and supply you with the new directions. Extremely useful!

The interface has been improved to a certain extent as well. The buttons are now larger so it's easier to use while in a vehicle (of course, you still need to pull over when you need to make major changes, or when you want to find a point of interest).

And yes, you can use the old GPS receivers found in previous editions with absolutely no issues.

In the past, I've used Adobe Flash and Windows Movie Maker to make my trailers. Both have their pluses and minuses. Flash, for example, is expensive and comes with a high learning curve, whereas Windows Movie Maker is free (on the Windows OS), but extremely limiting.

Some authors (and publishers) create simple slide transitions with static imagery accompanied by background music. I, personally, find these types of trailers a bit dull, and not all that professional. The more ""movie-like"" a book trailer can be the better chance it has of gaining interest.

Like Flash, Anime Studio uses both a timeline and layers, which gives you the ability to create detailed motions: such as a character walking with clouds floating in the background. The bone structure in AS (Anime Studio) allows for easy character movements, such as lifting an arm and bending an elbow at the same time. This actually works easier than it does in Flash. I also like how there is a library of pre-made body parts, such as eyes (with different expressions) and mouths that animate automatically based on the words spoken in your audio (you can also change the pitch of your voice to sound more cartoon'ish-which you can record directly in the program). This is a major time saver. There are also wizards that help you to create your own custom characters without much effort (though I wish there was an easy way to create backgrounds too). Another great feature is that you can directly (from AS) upload your animations to Facebook and YouTube.

That said, as an Adobe designer (for over ten years), I found the tools and shortcuts in Anime Studio different enough to make simple tasks somewhat difficult. My thought was to design my vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator, and then import them into AS. This isn't possible in Anime Studio Debut, but it is in the Pro version, which provides the ability to use Adobe for some things and AS for others.

If you are considering the Debut version instead of Pro, consider these limitations: a 2 minute animation maximum, limit of 3000 frames, no more than 2 audio tracks, only 1 video track, no 3D support, a 788 x 768 maximum export size, among a plethora of other limitations and missing features. I strongly suggest visiting the SmithMicro website and viewing their comparison chart if you are considering the Debut version over the Pro.

SO - I would never  get the $550 ""prebate"" that I was entitled to this year, except that I knew about it from previous tax filings.
Also, it bothers me that in order to get my ""prebate"" I had to fill out downloaded forms by hand after searching for needed information in my files and using a calculator to get some needed totals.  To me, this is NOT what I should have to do after spending over $65 for a Fed./State/e-filing program!!!
Besides, if Turbo Tax can fill out these forms automatically and have these same forms in its State of Vermont Tax Program - what is wrong with TaxCut doing the same thing???  (I chatted online with TaxCut's customer support about this problem and they told me (a week ago) that there would be no updates to their Vermont program and that they ""do not include all needed forms"" in their program.)
NOW, wouldn't you think it is important to know about and be able to file forms HS-122 and HS-144 when you might get $500 or more back for submitting them?
What does this say about TaxCut and their completeness of tax preparation software?
What does this say about TaxCut's concern for their customers????

I had never bothered to try AVG Internet Security (AVG IS), mainly because it is an expensive package in comparison to most of the other offerings on the market. That said, it is a solid product and worth consideration in spite of the cost.

I should start by stating, for the record, that I had a dreadful install experience. AVG IS partially installed itself and then errored out. After a reboot, AVG IS was alive but outdated, and what was broken was the ability to update. Worse, the uninstall was also broken. After getting the uninstall ironed out, I tried to install again and this time everything was much smoother.

AVG IS is organized and clean with a very clear and easy-to-understand overview dashboard. At a glance you can tell what is active and what is not active. Double-clicking on any of the icons in this view gives access to adjustment controls by which the component in question can be manipulated and set as desired. I like this particular view. One thing that is not clear, though, is that to get to the real nuts and bolts of the various components' configurations, one must use the pull-down menus, not the icons.

AVG's firewall appears to do a good job of hiding the system on the net, locking down service ports and cutting off ping responses. I was unable to break it. However, where it gets interesting is in the control afforded the user - individual applications can be locked down, policies set for different networks, and so much more. Other firewalls do this, but AVG's organization in the interface is better than average.

AVG's track record as an antivirus vendor is well known. However, with versions prior to 9.0 their antivirus was slow, intrusive and hard to interrupt. AVG seems to have gotten the idea of how to improve this - it took about 90 minutes to scan over 1,000,000 items if you include the registry and even running at full speed I hardly noticed except for the fact that I had the task manager open and saw an occasional spike in CPU activity. I launched several applications, typed a lot, and even searched for a file on the hard drive and saw no real impact on the system. Cycles consumed seemed to be consistently under 10%.

AVG throws a lot of other things into the mix that you'd expect in a decent suite - antispam, antispyware, rootkit detection, and several other components. What surprised me was to find a process viewer that has the ability to kill processes, accessible from the dashboard under system tools. I have never worked with a security suite with that built-in as part of the package. Included is a connectivity viewer and even a startup process viewer, with the ability to manipulate the entries within. That's a very nice plus.

I've been unable to work with the antispam up to this point, as I get no spam. Even so, there are many, many settings that can be adjusted to the antispam, such as adding a blacklist server such as spamcop to assist with checking, Bayesian training and a lot more. Based on the feature set I suspect this antispam is very effective.

AVG IS includes a McAfee-style system of evaluating returns from search engines, marking unsafe links in the results window. It is not as thorough as McAfee's Site Adviser, but it is effective in giving you  heads-up when there is a possible danger ahead.

There are two things that AVG does not have that I wish were present. First, there is no parental control module. It looks like AVG made no effort at all to include a parental controls module, and while that's ok it is something that most other security suites include.  I was unable to even find a manual block list - if it's there, I cannot find it. Second, I found no ability to see the presence of other computers on the network. It is not something that I have found in a lot of suites but it's a very nice-to-have.

AVG has put together a very nice internet security suite. The main components, the antivirus and the firewall, are both very effective and all of the other components seem to be working nicely. There is room for some improvement/expansion, as is true with most security suites, but what is here is very polished and clean. AVG is a little pricey when compared to most other suites, but in spite of that cost it is very much worth consideration when looking at computer security suites. I am comfortable giving AVG IS a 5/5 stars rating - it isn't absolutely perfect, but what is there is excellent.",Solid Product,1259798400,7.0,

My notes below are brief because my goal was to list the attributes that persuaded me to keep this software rather than reverting to Office 2004. Indeed, I kept Office 2004 on my computer for five months after I installed this suite, so I could do side-by-side comparisons and decide which version to keep.

THE GOOD:
* PowerPoint functionality is more robust.
* PowerPoint themes make it simple to assemble an attractive basic presentation on the fly. While documentation and help are sketchy, applying brute force logic (and some experience with Photoshop and Quark) enabled me to make PowerPoint do some visual processes I thought that it ""should"" be able to do.
* Word loads faster and is more intuitive. It also has more modular components.
* PDF creation in Word is a simple ""save-as"" menu selection, which saves time compared with the print>save as PDF workaround.
* Anecdotally, Excel and Word are much better-behaved than the previous versions, with no and few hangs, respectively. I am a light user of Excel but use Word daily; the almost-daily aggravation is a thing of the past.

THE CAUTIONS:
* As with other Microsoft products, this suite does chew through a lot of resources. However, after trying out its svelter competition, I come back to Office for my personal use because of the convenience of using what most other folks use.
* Despite multiple attempts and multiple unanswered electronic queries to Microsoft, I have not been able to complete the online registration/tagging that is the last step of the install. (All seems well without it, but this situation leaves me a bit uneasy.)
* The install process is time-consuming. Allow at least two hours to install the software and then download and install multiple patches, even with lots of free space available on your hard drive. Contrast this with the approximately one hour it took to move from Leopard to Snow Leopard and perform further updates. For context, I used to do clean installs of OSes on our work Macs every two months back in the bad old days.

THE VERDICT:
I deleted my Office 2004 suite after five months of side-by-side use and, except for one minor irritant with header selection in Word, have not looked back.",Serviceable,1307059200,2.0,

Installation of the software on the notebook went well, and I plugged the small GPS unit into a free USB port on my Asus put the netbook on the passenger seat and headed out.

The software interface feels dated; I wasn't entirely impressed with either the design or functionality.  Many functions weren't very intuitive, with multiple panes opening and closing providing different data.  Once I sorted it out and programmed my first trip in though, things got a bit easier.

The GPS unit picked up satellites quickly and easily, besting the GPS unit in my phone as well as a dedicated handheld Magellan unit I had brought for comparison.  My  trip progress was tracked accurately, with a readout of estimated mileage and ETA updated on the fly.  The major problem was finding things nearby.

With freestanding GPS units, it's easy to simply ask it to display nearby gas stations, hotels, etc.  However, there's no way to do this easily with S&T.  The only way to get that information is to go to the turn-by-turn list of directions, figure out which step you are near, select THAT, and then request nearby places of interest.  Not only wasn't it intuitive, it was useless to me: I used my G1 and its GPS unit for that functionality most of the time.  One other problem I had was a few software crashes. I was unable to determine if this was bad code or an underpowered netbook - though mine is easily able to run everything else I've thrown at it.

I suppose if you sat in a room and planned your trip, then loaded those trips as you traveled, this would work fine. Alternatively, if you had a navigator with you running the computer, you might be in ok shape, if not a bit puzzled at times by the interface.

But for use as a GPS on the fly while traveling solo, I'd give it a pass.  It just doesn't provide the ease of use or functionality I want in a GPS.","Good GPS Unit, OK For Planning, Not Great For On-The-Fly",1250553600,3.0,

Altogether it took about 20 minutes, it was a seamless process.  If you know that you want to install on several computers / laptops all at once you're good to go.  If not, you do have an option for later installation:  ""You can always install Sage 50 on additional computers later.""  I was simply installing in on my PC, so opted for the one for now.

One other thing you'll need to consider during installation is disabling your firewall.  I chose to allow my Windows Firewall to work with Sage, but I could also have configured it manually.  There are a few things to consider when installing, but I found it to be an easy step-by-step process with no problems.  I simply closed out everything in the background and concentrated on the installation process.

Sage 50 is perfect for the individual accountant or small business bookkeeper.  Customer support has been spotty in the past and that has been their biggest downfall.  This packet comes with a full year of customer support and online updates.  What I'm seeing and want to see, is easy access for when I need help.  There's online assistance where I can ""manage a case"" by shooting off an email or can access technical support via chat.  Personally I much prefer using phone support when I have issues (866-747-3888).  The proof is in the pudding as they say and if anyone is having issues, later reviews will probably let everyone know how customer support is doing.

Learning curves are sometimes what the individual makes of them.  I'm so far liking what I see.  I was able to take a look at a sample company and could easily spot a section ""Getting Around Sage 50.""  If I can't see anything right in a program or if I have to buy an expansive book I easily become frustrated and will turn away.  Sage has everything right where I want it ... at my fingertips right in the program.  More than likely, the lengthy installation had something to do with this.  I don't want to buy a ""secrets"" sort of book nor do I want to go scouting around on the net to find out something.

I was looking at ""Show-Me-How Videos,"" ""Quick Reference Guides,"" and a list of ""Sage University Courses.""  No further expenditure was needed on my part.  I didn't have to take a pill so to speak from getting a headache looking at a mess.  Everything was laid out nicely and wasn't overwhelming.  Many of the learning areas had drop down menus with additional areas to explore.  I'm going to list what I saw as an easy-access learning menu below.

Do I think I can easily manage and work with this accounting software?  Yes.  Am I confident the company will come through with that customer support that was lacking in the past?  I'm not sure, but that remains to be seen and can't be predicted without more people weighing in.

It's tough sometimes to review a product like this, because if it works well... and Trend Micro Internet Security Pro does... there is little to notice; no worms, no identity theft, no problem.  Is Trend Micro 100% responsible for those results?  Probably not, as I would like that think that my common sense caution plays some role in my lack of drama.  But I'll give them credit for at least 75% of my success.

Even moderately cautious users will occasionally click on the wrong link, and it's comforting to see Trend Micro step between you and a suspicious web site from time to time.  Note to those that might see this little intervention on a regular basis, you just might want to rethink what you want out of the internet (genuine information and entertainment, or ????).

So, no virus infections within the past year.  No Trojan attacks, and everything appears to be safe and secure.  This is good!

Besides the basics, there are two features that I appreciate most, the System Tuner and the Trend Micro Vault.  My Vista-running PC has always been slow to boot and vulnerable to lags caused by resident software like security programs.  But what good does a security program do for you if it causes everything else to run more slowly? Internet Security Pro 3.0 doesn't create that problem.  And the System Tuner helps you tweak your resident software and file sizes to make that even less a problem.

I've had problems with other security programs in the past (Microsoft, Norton and McAfee), but this has been the most trouble-free package for me by far.  Installation was simple and quick, registration went off without a hitch and my system performance is clearly better.

And what about the System Vault?  Consider it your last-ditch defense.  If someone manages to walk off with your notebook, System Vault won't let them into the files that you least want shared.  'Nuff said.

I found 2012 a complete rethinking of the much older version that I had been using for a number of years. Now the 2014 is an update rather than an upgrade. If you have another version of Family Tree Maker on your computer installing this one means you have two versions on your computer.

I uninstalled 2014 from the netbook and installed it on a new laptop with Windows 8.1.  It went on easily with the program immediately updating itself and also downloading and installing at least twice in the last month.  You do need to install the program entirely to your computer. You cannot run it by putting the disc in the CD/DVD drive. Do make sure you have a substantial amount of memory available on your hard drive.

I can't tell a great deal of difference between the 2012 version and this version. However, there was a paper manual included, which is a miracle.  It's a handy size and easy to read and follow if you have some basic knowledge of the program.

The public record searches seem better. I'm not sure if this is due to Ancestry.com or the program, but I discovered a number of pieces of information that I had been missing.

OK, if you have an old computer with not much space on the hard drive I cannot recommend this.  I'm not fond of Windows 8.1 but this program works better with it than with XP.

Sometimes I have my computer hooked up to a hard drive on my desk, and I'd rather lean back in my chair  than have my hands on the keyboard. Or when I'm taking notes for research, I'll have my hands on a book and it's something of a pain to try and type while I'm holding the book open. On those occasions, Dragon Dictate comes in handy. I'd hoped that with the new speech recognition on Mac's Snow Lion that would solve my problem. But it really doesn't recognize words very well, and I need to go back and correct things nearly every sentence. With Dragon Dictate, I almost never need to make corrections. For example, I am writing this with Dragon Dictate. All I needed to do was open up the program, enable speech recognition, then click into the box for writing reviews. Now I am speaking this review, and it works just fine. The only times I need to make corrections are in cases where I use a possessive word in a context where it isn't obvious. In those cases, Dragon Dictate naturally treats the word as if it ends with an S, and then I need to go in and fix it. If you say something that you don't mean, or that looks wrong, just say delete. And it will remove the last thing you typed. If you want to remove a single word, just say delete, and the word. You do have to mention to place a comma or a period, and  I just realized that it has a hard time typing out the word ""comma.""  I know that the program comes with a list of keywords and commands that you can carry around with you, but I don't have them with me now and I don't even remember where they are, and all I really expect to do with this is dictation, but even without that dictation works pretty well. Again, I just dictated all of this and I only had a few corrections to make. Not bad, eh? (Note that I couldn't get it to type ""eh""; I had to spell it out. Oh well.)

Just for a quick comparison I am going to now dictate the first three sentences of my review using the built-in speech recognition on my Mac:

""well I generally prefer typing, Dragon dictate for Mac comes in handy when I'm not in the mood to type. Sometimes I have my computer hooked up to a hard drive on my desk, and I'd rather lean back in my chair and have my hands on the keyboard. Or, when I'm taking notes for research, I have my hands on a book and it's something of a pain to try and type one holding the book open."" - Not terrible, but not quite as good.

Anyhow, I won't be using this to open up applications, or shift between them. I'll just be using it for hands-free composition, and mostly only when I'm taking notes on something I'm reading.

Here's my review. .  . .. .

I have been using this product, off and on, for a little over a month now.  Here's my take on it. . . . If you are either a slow typist, or have a disability which does not allow you to type, then I think that this software is probably going to be helpful for you.  The box says that most people type no more than 40 words per minute.  I type over twice that.  I use this software when I want to send a letter to a friend.  I would not use this for business purposes.  You spend a lot of time correcting and ""training"" the system.  I find far fewer mistakes when I'm typing it myself than when I'm using this software.  But again, I type relatively fast.  Having spent a LOT of extra money to purchase the ""Preferred"" edition, I really wish I had stuck with the ""Standard"" edition.  Using it for Excel (not available on the Standard edition)  is cumbersome at best, and being that often times numbers are so important in spreadsheets, it's quite ""error prone"" and correcting a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet is not fun.  Again, I'm not really knocking the software.  I think it does a relatively good job overall, and I'm sure that if you take the time to make all of the corrections it gets better. .  .. but. . . I think if you type fast to begin with, you're probably not going to be too happy with this software.  Unless the above ""extras"" included in the Preferred edition are really worth a lot to you, I would recommend the Standard edition and save yourself some $$.

- Arrived in 2 days, today!  Installed (on WinXP, SP3) and worked flawlessly.

Got all the way down to filing the return (tonite!) ...and even up to: ""How do You Want Your Federal Refund"" but WAS Very dismayed to Not see the option for the Amazon Gift Card purchase!  :-(

What I learned from intuit help forum:

Problem Scenario (just like mine): ""I am currently on the File -> How would you like to get your federal refund? page and I do not see an option to receive part of the refund on Amazon Gift Cards. The only options that I see are Direct Deposit, Paper Check and Split into Multiple Accounts.""

Resolution: ""it is past that section. Enter that you want the refund to be deposited to your account, and enter bank info. The page will come up after that.""

I did that, and sure enough, it worked! I see option: ""I'll use all or some of my refund to purchase an e-gift card and get an extra 10%"" And the Amazon logo is there, etc.

Cool!  :-)

Hope this helps somebody else to bypass a bad moment I had there.

Also note that, to get the Amazon Gift Card, you have to e-file and Not split your refund over multiple accounts (just one bank account). Some other restrictions are there, but don't apply to an average guy like me.

For about 10 years now, I have enjoyed the perfection of the Turbo Tax software.  Only one year did I have an install issue, and that was quickly resolved by Customer Support.  And as a bonus - the tip I got from the support rep has been used to resolve other software installs and shared with others over the years.  (Thanks *again* to ""Rey"" from Turbo Tax customer support!)

Love the way I can import last year's tax data and don't re-type squat!  This is HUGE to me!  W-2s are tedious!

-> Please note, I always go with the CD/ROM version exclusively.  (I note that the download version reviews aren't so hot this year)

You just can't beat the completeness, rapidity and perfection of the Turbo Tax experience as delivered on the CR/ROM version.

I was able to do the Schedule D (stocks) even tho the higher versions are recommended.  Again, in contrast .... the download Deluxe version does NOT do the Schedule D whatsoever (must go to Premiere or higher) -- so this is another reason to go with the CD/ROM.

On the CD/ROM Deluxe version you can enter your stock sales, and functionality is not broken whatsoever!  Also applies to CD/ROM Basic version too -- I used Basic for Sched D last year and prior years.

Went with Deluxe this year for the 10% gift card bonus -- In contrast, Basic CD/ROM version  is only 5% bonus on the gift card.  So the Deluxe version will be money well-spent, cuz  I'm gonna put a LOT on the Amazon Gift Card, whoa yea!

Also note that State Filing is Not included in this product (and I don't need it).

I will be back to give updates.  IE: the day my Amazon Gift Card arrives.  I'm sure many of you are eager to know if it is legit.  So far, so good.

UPDATE 2014.02.15 - You cannot apply ALL of your refund to the Amazon Gift card as advertised.  I've contacted Amazon already about the discrepancy. You can apply all of your refund except $200, per the intuit website ( https://ttlc(dot)intuit(dot)com/questions/1981054-amazon-e-gift-card-maximum  ).  Hence:

Max Gift Card = Your refund - $200

I faithfully owned every version of Money Microsoft produced and then they did an end of life on there software so I switched to Quicken. Well then I got a mac and went to quicken for mac and it was nice. I used Quicken 2007 for mac for several years and finally Quicken came out with what they called ""Quicken Essentials"" which was just a useless program. They stripped out most the useful features, etc. So I downgraded back to Quicken 2007 as my primary finance tool and in parallel started playing with iBank. iBank is NOT as ""pretty"" as Quicken 2007 was which is sort of sad to say. But the software does everything I need it to do. Then when Apple announced OSX Lion and Quicken announced Quicken 2007 would not work well that just sealed the deal. I left quicken 2007 and have been using iBank 4. I've used iBank for probably 3 months now off and on and the last 2 weeks daily as my primary tool. It was a slow transition  as I wanted to get used to it slowly before I upgraded to Lion.

What I like is it works. It's simple and the web connect download of transactions is super fast. Quicken used to take a long time to download my transactions, iBank is a meere matter of seconds.

iBank also has the one feature most other software is missing, the cash flow forecast. A vital tool with how I do my budgets.

iBank is NOT the most polished piece of software I've ever used. But given the limited finance software on the mac it really is the best. Plus if you use the add-on iphone app and sync your data to it, you have one more way to keep track of your money. The app is a few bucks in the app store but it is worth it.

I'm happy with this, I wish they would fix some graphic issues, make the forecast chart look better, but that's really the only complaint I have and that's minor.

If you need finance software I recommend you download a trial version of this software from the developers website at iggsoftware and then if you like it enough to buy it, get it here on amazon as it is cheaper then buying it straight from the developer or the apple app store.","Is it the ultimate solution?

In some cases I am very fortunate, as some lines of my genealogy records so far go back almost 1,000 years.  In other cases because one side of my family recently emigrated (or more accurately, most are still in Iran), I have very little reliable information going back even 50 years.  So I can have both the puzzle and the satisfaction of a ton of information, and I need a lot of good research tools as well as a great way to organize my work.

I've used Ancestry.com before, without additional software, and the difference between the website and Family Tree Maker's GUI is substantial.  It's much faster and easier to work with this software.  I found the included documentation easy to use.  Importing pictures and documents was also easy, which was awesome as I have two very extensive word documents from two relatives that are now preserved for my family to enjoy.  I ran through a bit of the tutorial and found it well made, but the software was intuitive enough that I really didn't need it.  Exporting appears to be very straightforward as well.

For that matter, I put a lot of time into this software and have already exhausted my free month.  In that time I did not encounter any glitches.  Solid software.

Another point about Ancestry.com is that I don't really need a persistent subscription.  I'll get on this kick once in a while, usually just after the holidays, and then I'll go a year or more without having time for it.  This software gives me the best of both worlds as I retain my work and can even update my digital family tree, as well as share it with family when they visit, but I only have to pay for Ancestry.com on months where I'm going to be using it.  All my work is stored locally on my computer.

The different editions primarily pertain to the duration of the included membership.  I have the Essentials edition, which is the one I'd recommend as the best practical value, even though the Platinum costs less per month of Ancestry.com use.  And Ancetry.com is the real deal and will be of tremendous use to most people who are researching their family history.

The family tree viewing is dynamic and intelligently conveys relationship information in a variety of ways, especially for very detailed family trees in the Pedigree mode.  For me this had the effect of making it much more fun to include a lot more information and more relatives on my tree (and actually all of them).  The other effect is that people actually enjoy seeing my family tree, because it is actually easily presented on screen.

Time Machine has been a fantastic feature to have, painlessly backing up data for me in the background and saving me the trouble of doing so manually.  Typically it does so with no additional drag on the responsiveness of the computer (which is several years old, and I tend to run a lot of programs at a time) though occasionally if I've left it unhooked from the external drive for an extended period and it has a lot to sort through the responsiveness will slow for a minute or two while it catches up.

Spaces is a great feature as well, allowing you to divide your windows up among multiple 'virtual' desktops.  On this particular computer I find that I don't use it a great deal, because I don't find that a laptop lends itself to this style of use for me.  However, I've used similar features from Linux distributions on a desktop to know that in that situation it's a great help to keeping things organized and moving along.

Word is effectively the standard format for documents in the American business world, and most of my employers use Exchange as their email server. Therefore, what I most want from my office suite is something that 1. works well reading and writing Word documents and 2. provides a way to connect to my employer's Exchange server and properly handle its calendars, meeting requests, etc.

Office 2008 for Mac just does that! I pulled up and edited my old PC Office-created Word resume with no problem, and haven't experienced major issues reading any other Word document yet. The Exchange capabilities of Entourage work like a charm, let you accept and send meeting requests and generally enable you do all of the things you're used to doing with Outlook, but can't currently do with Mac Mail. The simple Excel spreadsheets I used for timesheets pulled up in Mac Excel without a hitch and Messenger and Powerpoint are nice-to-haves.

For better or worse (I say better), the interface for Office 2008 for Mac isn't the ribbon interface you may be used to with Office 2007 for PC, but after getting used to the Mac's Office interface, I actually found it easier to use!

I miss having applications like OneNote (though Word has a similar ""Notebook"" mode), InfoPath and Visio, the forthcoming version of Mac Mail diminishes Entourage's value by providing Exchange support and power-users of Office may miss features like the ability to hack together VBA macros (the Mac Workflows are a bit more limited), but for most business users, Office 2008 for Mac will suit their needs perfectly and provide the necessary hook into the Microsoft Office suite that currently dominates the business landscape.

Overall, I'd recommend the package and think it's an essential purchase for most business users especially since SP2 added Live Workspace and SharePoint integration. However, with Mac Mail gaining Exchange support and because there are several programs for PC Office that don't come with Office 2008 for Mac, the Mac suite loses a star in my eyes.",Great at General Productivity and Exchange Email.

Ive used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that Ive had to purchase much more expensive editions of the product to handle all the forms, and Ive generally paid extra for the audit defense guarantee.

This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product.

First, in some situations Intuit won't let you retrieve and print prior years returns unless youve paid for the current years product. I cant remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is don't just save your tax return in Intuits file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records.

The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I couldn't file because a particular form wasn't ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but E-File on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for E-File, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark DO NOT FILE - FORM NOT FINAL even though its supposed to be available. I tried checking for updates and reinstalling as suggested but no luck. I was finally able to find a telephone number for customer service and speak to someone there after a 20-minute hold, only to be told they had no information other than what I knew from searching the forums, and no process for escalating my call to anyone who could help or even give me an updated ETA. I was promised a full refund for the software but have had to start all over on preparing my taxes and several weeks have gone by in which I could have already filed my return.

Intuit makes it hard to speak to anyone in the first place, and harder still to find anyone who can help you with your problems. Between that and the limited access to your own information that magically becomes no problem if you simply give them more money, Im very dissatisfied.","Missing forms prevent filing, paid customer's prior years' data held hostage",1423699200,3.0,

Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.

Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.

Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time. Yes I can do this with a smart folder but I would like to have option not to since I don't always want to come back to the search later.

Posting to Facebook and Flickr only gives you access to some of the features on those sites. You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.

If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos.

Now the only way a can access them is to boot back and forth between my old hard drive. It is a good thing I happen to have two drives in my machine or I would have to recreate them. I imagine this is what you would have to do if you had a laptop.

The recent area on the sidebar only shows the last event you look at. This is ok but I would like to see a history of the last several events I viewed.

I tested this software with a current project of editing some old silent 8mm family films that were captured to DVD in a horrendous menu.  The biggest challenge with a product like PowerDirector is learning the basics.  I know something can be done, but am not sure the steps to take to do this.  Add the challenge of mental focus as well... while I'm discovering how to export to file or create a menu, I am seeing all these other things that I wonder what they are and then... boom... down another rabbit hole I go.

While I could figure out how to do things, it took some poking and prodding to figure things out.  I would call the user interface nice, but not stunning.  I could find things, but they didn't always leap out at me, or certain functions didn't activate to be visual until clicking on a track and so on.

PowerDirector provides a lot of tools and features very nice feature  I haven't even scratched the surface of.  One feature I was very appreciative of was the fix/enhance feature, under that I used the video stabilize to help smooth out some hand held jittery videos.  I expect over time I will discover more amazing features as needs arrive.

Overall, this is a very solid and powerful product that I am happy to own.  When small projects pop up I will not be scrounging around for a video tool.",Powerful product - user interface ok,1446422400,,

Ray,"As the happy owner of a new digital camera, it seemed natural to install some video editing software so I could play with my home videos a bit. Having used Corel's software in the past, I looked forward to trying VideoStudio Pro X6.

I've never edited video before and I've also never had a video camera before. I am very proficient with technology and computers, as my career is in IT. Based on past experience with other Corel products, I expected VideoStudio Pro X6 to be a bit more intuitive than it has been so far. Again, I am a complete novice at video editing, so perhaps this is part of a learning curve for me. Until I've had more time to learn and experiment, I'm giving the software a neutral rating while I tell you what I have experienced already.

The install went very smoothly. I put it on my laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate with 16 GB of Ram and an i7 processor. Launching the software is also smooth and the software doesn't take long to load on my PC.

Corel presents you with a mini help window when you first launch the software. The `Home' tab has information and links to helpful items, including a link to check for software updates. The `Learn' tab has helpful training videos. The `Do More' tab has a number of downloadable add-ons, many of which are free. And the last tab is for `Messages'.

There are also very thorough user guides you can download from their website. Normally, I find most software easy to figure out and refer to such manuals for extra tips and information I couldn't figure out on my own. It is apparent I will need to go through this one page by page to learn how to use this software. It would be nice if they had some tutorials that took you through various tasks step by step. There may be such but I haven't found them yet if there are.

So far, I've been able to get video clips into a project, although that took quite a bit of time for me to learn. The import function I found in the `Capture' area does not work as I had expected it to. Now that I have a video clip in the software to work with, I'm working on learning how to edit it and in what ways it can be modified.

As I said before, I am granting it a neutral 3-star rating for now. I had expected this software to be more intuitive - I've had no trouble learning Corel's photo editing software. Once I've worked with the software a bit more, I will adjust my rating however it is warranted and add the new experiences to my review. I do have to say, so far I find it disappointing that it has not been easier and more user friendly.

To an outside viewer any foreign language can seem like a perplexing challenge to take on. It usually requires regiments of classes and years of complex study. When Rosetta Stone advertized itself as being able to teach foreign languages in an easy, concise manner, I was very skeptical. Now that I've spent a few months using this software in the small gaps that open up during my busy schedule, my skepticism has completely dissolved.

While I can't claim to have gained mastery of the Japanese language, I can say that I've learned quite a lot by utilizing this outstanding software. The program allows the user to work with a headset, in which you speak various words and sayings into a microphone. Feedback is given on how well you pronouce these words and compared alongside the audio samples of native speakers. The visual techniques employed by the software is also very effective; the mind is immersed in a catalog of recognizable images that methodically builds up a network of associations and helps to gently increase your powers of memory.

While most study involved in Foreign Languages can be ardous and painful, Rosetta Stone somehow manages to turn the ordeal into a pleasent experience. The program is very user-friendly without being overly patronizing, and it ran very smoothly on my system without any sort of technical problems. I was honestly expecting some sort of technical hiccup due to the complex nature of the programming, but one never presented itself.

But perhaps the greatest aspect of Rosetta Stone is it's casual-though-effective structure to teaching. I found that simply using the program for just an hour a day proved to show progress, with most lessons taking 30 minutes or less to complete. It doesn't force its users to dedicate large portions of their life time in order to make progress. The way the lessons are timed and structured, one could come closer to understanding a foreign language while still maintaining a full and busy life with career, friends, and family.

Overall, I found Rosetta Stone to an effective tool in learning Japanese. I've only had the time to get through level 1 of the course, but I'm already inching my way closer to speaking and writing the alphabets of Japanese, without sacrificing any time from my normal schedule. It is highly recommended to everyone.",Advanced yet gentle learning experience,1219190400,,

I have used Norton Internet security, and then Norton 360 for years; it has served me very well. the 360 is very comprehensive as an antivirus and Network plus a password manager. It also has a feature when you do a search, for instance, to see which sites are safe, and which are known to be malicious, and shown with a green (safe) or Red (danger) icon next to the link.

 The upgrade procedure is a nightmare if you are trying to install it on to your PC as an upgrade, especially if you want to carry over remaining days from your current subscription of the regular Norton 360. quite a few reviewers here have complained about the same issue. The Amazon download purchase of this product gives you a link to Symantec's website, where you enter your logon credentials, and the registration Key into the form. So far, no problem. The norton downloader installs, which then downoads the Norton 360 Premiere install file. When it is done, it says it is complete, and you are given the option to activate it, which again askes you for your registation key. When you enter it, it gives you an error that it is for the incorrect product. Everybody has complained on this, and I thought I would be more successful, lol.
You wind up closing the window, and looking at your current Norton 360, and see no change, so you click on the upgrade link, where you can enter the reg key: same error. You look into the folder where the downoad went into (Premiere NEVER DID install) and double click the file, which then actually does something and tells you that it needs to first uninstall the old 360, and also gives your the very wise opportunity to save your user settings, like your password vault first. you reboot your PC, and all you wind up with is (No new Norton 360 Premiere), a little icon in the taskbar for the password vault. So you install it again from the downloaded install file and it is successful, and asks for the reg key once more.

Now, how do you get your remaining days back from your ""old"" subscription? You go on Norton's web site and finally find out how to start a Chat session, enter your info, and get put into the Chat que. I was number 104 in line to start. It took about 45 minutes to get a rep on the chat session.  I actually put this paragraph in the wrong place..  Before I even went to start the download and upgrade, I went to Chat first to be told the correct procedure, and the rep only said that before he can carry over the remaining days, I must first install and activate the Premiere product. He actually never told me HOW to do the above correctly.
He also gave me a case number to use after I activated the new product, so I could continue afterwards and get the days transferred. I did that this morning, and it took another 40 minutes to go from #44 in the que to chat with a rep. He got it done for me no problem.
So I have 2 more PC's to do this to, and it whould work out easy I hope.

I hate to sound like I'm bitchy and whiney, normally I'm not, but this really got to me. If only the instructions were clear and accurate.
If you have no previous product to upgrsade from, you should have no problem. Others here have advised to uninstall the old product first, but I thought I was smarter than them. Well, I AM NOT, lol.

Now WHY did I not wait untill my old product subscription expired? Because I wanted to make sure the reg key I got was valid and worked. The others were right. Uninstall the old product FIRST.

It seemed more stable then the previous antivirus programs I've used, so I went ahead and updated it to Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 after about two weeks of use. Worked the same for a while until I started really noticing the difference between these programs and my last antivirus program, Spyware Doctor.

When I first installed Bitdefender Antivirus 2010, it found a couple of problems that Spyware Doctor didn't. However, since then it's found almost nothing, which is strange... when I used Spyware Doctor, I would scan every night and find four or five minor problems (tracking cookies, etc) over the course of a week. This program hasn't found anything in the last two months. I finally reinstalled Spyware Doctor and came up with several minor security risks that Bitdefender ignored. My definitions are automatically updated, so that isn't the problem.

After about a month of using it, I began having strange problems. First, Bitdefender's firewall suddenly began causing problems with programs that were normally allowed to access the internet. I tried removing them from the exceptions list then re-adding them, but nothing worked. I finally gave up and disabled Bitdefender's firewall and everything worked fine again. I emailed their support, but never received a response.

Second, around the same time I began having computer lockups... my computer would stop responding and run EXTREMELY slow. At the same time, the Bitdefender icon in the taskbar would turn grey with the message telling me that Bitdefender encountered a problem and I need to restart the computer. It usually cleared itself up within a few minutes, but would reoccur randomly. Sometimes it would go several days, other times it would happen two to three times in a single evening. I finally had to shut down the real-time monitoring, which seems to have cured this problem.

""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing.

I first purchased it when my primary computer began acting sluggish -- it was in need of maintenance but I had no idea what. For me, SM was a god-send ... it breathed new life into an aging machine and allowed me to keep it up and running for 4 more years. I love the product so much that I've used the trial version on my elder parents' machines. I also use it on my DH's machine ... and he's an IT professional. I now have new machine, and one of my first installs was ... you guessed it, SM 9 for Win7.

That said, some words of advice when using SM.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

That said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs. That's what it's done for me.

It was far better than any others I have used before. Now my wife and I have tablets as well, and I find myself doing more business on my portable devices.  Norton Small Business-10 Device was perfect for my needs. It works on PCs, Macs, or Android devices..

This  is solid antivirus software that detects most viruses we have encountered in the past. It works on PCs, Macs, or Android devices, and catches viruses that other well known antivirus products could not detect. I love the packaged license deal where we have the flexibility of using one license for multiple devices..

One thing does seem like a step back for me.. I loved just the Norton Antivirus multiple user license because it does not contain the redundant firewall. Now with small business I have to turn off the Norton firewall so both the windows firewall and the Norton firewall don't double up and give me false positives.

Installation was easy. The license lets you install the software from their website with just one key. You can then manage all protected devices from your online account and move protections around as your collection of devices changes.

All of the devices start their protection when the first device is activated.  This can be a bit annoying, but you know when they all need to be renewed.

 The Safe Search Toolbar installs automatically so you can search safely right from your browser. There are plenty of search toolbars available. I like having one that matches my PC security package.

Some features I really like for my phones are Scream Alarm (sets off an alarm and alerts you to the location of a users misplaced smart phone or tablet), Remote Locate (helps pinpoint a lost or stolen phone or tablet on a map to help you find it), Remote Lock (helps lock devices to prevent others from using them if lost or stolen, and Remote Wipe (helps erase sensitive information on Android devices if they are lost or stolen).

If you want a program with a flashy installation screen, transparent splash screens, 2.3GB of hard drive space taken up and a whopping 32,443 items added to your registry then this is your program.  It's no wonder the system requirements are so steep.  As a CD and DVD burner, I see little difference between this and the many other programs out there (including freeware).  Its DVD player is fine, but frankly I already have one.  The video studio has no real outstanding features that are better than any other cut and paste video program except maybe the ability to add soundtracks and voiceovers.  It's almost embarrassing to have only four different animated titles available and the fourth can't possibly be used for anything other than baby photos.  Seriously, four only?

Help is only located online and the instructions they give are very simplistic with a very small index.  I don't see a link to where you can ask questions either.  It's not really a studio, just four different programs.  This becomes evident when the icons appear on your desktop along with a gadget to open the programs just in case you weren't smart enough to double-click the icons.  Of course you were never asked permission during installation.  Corel also reassigns all the media files (movies, music, and photos) you used to play on Windows Media Player, your photo viewer or whatever you were using to Corel's programs without your permission too!  I call all this stuff vomitware.  Wake up Corel!

Out of all of the programs I used, the only one I found useful was the photo-editing program. The blemish removal and the suntan tool are useful, although the fake suntan could get red and blotchy if not used properly.  The red eye tool is supposed to work on pets too but I didn't find this to be the case.  The straighten tool seemed to chop up the photo more than straighten it.  The fine tune tool (aka the quick fix) brightened up pictures and made some of the old black and white photos I was restoring look really nice.  Strangely it made color photos look too bright and a little over saturated.  In short, it's fun for beginners to play around with but it's certainly not professional quality.  You get a whopping six edges and seventeen frames for your photos in this program.  It's basic, but it is easy to learn and it may save you time over competing photo editors.

Personally I would look around for a program with lesser system requirements and more features, especially since Corel needs to get more options in the features they already have.",Not impressed,1256774400,2.0,

First, VMware really rocks on my 8-core Mac Pro. For some reason I don't quite understand, it runs some Windows benchmarks within a virtual machine *faster* than booting Windows natively on the box! Graphics-intensive apps seem to do better natively, but anything that does lots of I/O seems to run faster under VMware.

The other thing I wanted to mention is that it's really more than just Windows on a Mac - you can run just about any Intel operating system within VMware. On my Mac Pro, I have Linux (both RedHat and SuSE/Novell) and a few other old Intel-based operating systems - even a very old OS/2. Honestly, this helped me justify the price of my Mac Pro - one box runs Mac, several versions of Windows, Linux and so on. And they all run really well... :)

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.

An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.

Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.

It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.","Annual expense, but some neat benefits",1381190400,,

I am so frustrated with this software. All I wanted to do was pull in three or four stills along with three short videos. Total run time about 2 minutes. Adding captions was limited as far as I can tell; I was not able to do what I wanted to do. Then when I tried to export a .mp4 file Pinnacle Studio 18 failed to export the video portions. I've now spent about three hours on this little project and have not been able to spit out my little project.

There's no way I'd buy this software and don't recommend it.

I take it all back. Dropping back to 3 stars.  While Pinnacle Studio 18 has basic video editing capabilities the user interface sure needs some improvement. On top of that the Help PDF file could be better as well. I had to refer to customer youtube videos to get a few basic things done recently.

The user interface for importing video files is cumbersome. Managing those video files within the tool is much too complex for a basic tool like this.

At one point I wanted to separate a sound track from a video file. At first I couldn't figure out how to do that so I went to the help file but found nothing. Then I went to the user forum where there was even confusion whether Studio 18 could even do that basic task. In the end I found it to be quite easy to do, albeit a little hidden. This is an example about how the user interface and help file could be greatly improved.

I was easily able to add a title to a video. When it came to adding a caption to overlay part of a video I searched and searched. Finally a user youtube video helped. The solution was to click on a video segment and use the Title key again. How is a user supposed to figure that out? Title is title and Caption is caption. How easy it would have been to simply add a Caption button and make the editing behavior be easier to use.

So, as I have no better tool, I'll continue to use Studio 18, but there's no way I'd buy an upgrade version of this product.

Well I'm bumping my review up from 3 stars to 4. My son and I both purchased GoPro cameras and I've just finished editing two hours of captured motorcycle dirt ride video down to 13 minutes. I included fade-in and fade-out sound, titles, and captions that overlay the video. I'm beginning to understand the capabilities of the tool.

I do find the user manual a bit lacking, but goggling user help turns up text or youtube help that solves the issue.

There are definite speed improvements using Studio 18 over Microsoft Movie Maker.

Dec 17, 2014
I am dropping from 4 stars to 3 stars based on the fact that I can not get Pinnacle Studio 18 to export a decent video with the particular input file I'm using. This is the main thing a video editor needs to do so if it fails that it is pretty much useless. I give it two stars based on the features it has, and the fact that my problem seems to be just that - my problem.

I could find little evidence that Exported video quality is a widespread issue with Studio 18. There were very few complaints about video quality. My problem has to do with the input file I was working with. It is a file downloaded from the internet. Nonetheless that is the file I wanted to edit and it didn't come out well. At the same time Microsoft Movie Maker did a fine job on it.

It works well with better input files. I tried one from my DSLR camera and the final file from Pinnacle Studio 18 and Microsoft Movie Maker came out nearly as good as the input file.

I did try to contact Pinnacle but they want to be paid for support which I consider poor customer support. I did interact with the user forum where I picked up some hints on how to improve output quality but nothing worked.

I can use the program but it looks like it is going to be hit or miss depending on the quality of the input file. To save myself the trouble I'll just continue using Movie Maker most of the time unless I feel I want to use a more advanced editor at which time I'll try Studio 18.

At this point I wouldn't spend money on this product and wouldn't recommend it.

Trouble. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but the video quality rendered in MP4/1080 is poor. I've tried to search the internet for help but didn't find any. If I create a video for Facebook no problem. But I have some videos that I wanted to trim some bad parts then render for watching on our large flat screen display. But even on my 24"" 1920 x 1080 computer monitor the output of Pinnacle Studio 18 is a disappointment.

I took a single file, cut out all but the first 5 minutes, then Exported an MP4/1080 video from Pinnacle Studio 18. The results were much less than satisfactory.

I then took the same file, again cut out all but the first 5 minutes, then Saved the move for High Definition Display using Microsoft Movie Maker. The results were quite good.

I will attempt to contact Pinnacle to see if there is anything I can do. I have a hard time believing the rendered output file can't be improved. A video editor tool that outputs bad quality video files is useless. But I've tried a number of attempts to obtain better image quality without success. Even if Pinnacle provides a solution it shouldn't be this hard.

Dec 10, 2014 Update
Today I captured a video of my 4-year-old receiving his yellow belt in Kempo Karate. Using Pinnacle Studio 18 I cliped out a part that was too long, then added a transition to make that cut out section flow nicely in the video. Then I added a title and a closing graphic transition.

Pros:
- Easy to install
- Easy to use the basic video editing features (without reading the manual if you can poke around a bit)
- The user manual is pretty good.
- The on-line video tutorials are quite informative.
- Pinnacle Studio 18 comes with a large number (1,500) of transitions.
- Comes with over 500 sounds (animals, bells, cartoons, etc.)
- Comes with 45 music clips
- Comes with over 550 Title video segments
- You can import photos and do some basic editing of them.
- It is easy to see that this program offers many features including multiple video tracks and audio tracks.

Cons:
- I had a difficult time altering the default execution time for a transition. Perhaps I need to read up on this.
- I was hoping I could ""crop"" or ""zoom"" a video. That doesn't seem to be available. On the other hand I don't know if any video editors allow that feature. Perhaps it is too much to expect.

Dec 9, 2014 Update
While watching some vacation video I found one that I had captured hand held with a long zoom lens and the video was shaky. I wondered if Pinnacle Studio 18 could stabilize it and sure enough that feature exists. I loaded the video file, ran the Stabilize Render and Play process and Poof the video was now much more watchable. Nice feature. Once again it consumed about 80% of my 64-bit quad-core 2.4GHz processor.

Dec 7, 2014 First Impressions. I've only had Pinnacle Studio 18 for a couple of days and just started using it today. I am a relative novice with video tools but I have quite a lot of computer experience.

I received Pinnacle Studio 18 free as a member of the Amazon Vine program.

I have used powerful video editing tools in the past, but my recent reference is Windows Movie Maker in Windows 7. For my needs Windows Movie Maker has been sufficient, although there were things I wished I could do to my videos which Windows Movie Maker did not support, such as zooming.

After I loaded Pinnacle Studio 18 it immediately offered to load a patch update which I accepted. The update worked flawlessly.

I have a great deal of computer experience, including being a graphical user interface programmer for 10 years. I believe I should be able to start a new software tool and use the basic features without first reading a user manual, or else the program does not have a good user interface. On the other hand every piece of software is unique so there is a start-up learning curve. Accessing the more advanced features usually requires reading the manual or watching tutorials.

I jumped right into a project involving four video files spanning about 15 minutes. I wanted to view the video content, and clip out any sections I didn't want to be part of the final video. Within 15 minutes I was able to discern the basics; loading my video files into the tool, putting the four videos in the order I wanted, assigning the videos to the timeline, and I learned how to cut out unwanted clips. It took me about an hour to work over my video, and begin the process of saving the final MPEG-4 500 megabyte file. So the tool passed my basic requirements.

After going through this early basic learning curve I find Pinnacle Studio 18 is easier to use than Windows Movie Maker. I am very likely to use Pinnacle Studio 18 for my video projects going forward.

Pinnacle offers on-line video tutorials as well as a text based user manual. I watched a bit of one of the youtube.com videos which I thought was quite good. I will likely take advantage of those tutorials for some of the advanced features.

This tool works my computer quite hard. I have a quad 2.4GHz processor with 8GB of RAM so it is reasonably powerful. I also tend to have several things running on my computer. I did encounter slow operation of all of my computer tasks while Pinnacle Studio 18 was rendering and saving my video file. As soon as the file was saved, which was much faster than Windows Movie Maker would have taken, my computer was freed up and working normally.

The resulting video file was smooth and the transitions were clean.

I'm not done and intend to re-edit my video, adding fancy transitions. I may try some voice-overs too. I will return here to add more comments. I realize this review is currently lacking in useful detail.",User interface is challenging at best,1417910400,2.0,

App Performance: A+
VM states suspend and resume seamlessly and quickly.

Windows Performance:A+
The windows users in my office are using fairly new PCs and laptops, but with crappy graphics cards.  My Macbook Pro (early 2007 version) runs windows ""faster"" than any version of windows in the office.  Is it really faster?  There's no way to know without running benchmarks, but it seems faster, and that's something.

Interface: A -
Accessibility to Windows and Windows apps is simple, as are installation and configuration utilities.  Windows apps are still bound to a single screen when using spaces - even in 'unity' mode.  This is a major gripe I have with VMs in general, as I use multiple work spaces.  For those who use a single screen, or who run the VM in a dedicate screen 'space', this isn't a problem.  It keeps me out of 'unity' mode and in full screen though.

Mac/PC sharing: A
Your home folder on your Mac shows up as an attached drive (Z:), making navigation to mac directories and files simple and easy (and fast!)

Networking: A+
Fast networking, with setup so easy I almost forgot to review it :-)
Overall: A+

Details:

I'm a long-time Windows-on-Mac user, starting back in the day of Virtual PC, and most recently using Parallels (I currently use Parallels v3.0).  I want to start this review by saying that, for many casual PC users looking to run Windows on a Mac, there probably isn't a need -- most everything I do day to day (at work and home) can be done on either OS, and if you own mac hardware, you'll be happier running Mac apps as well.  UNLESS you have that ""one application"" that isn't supported natively.

In my office, we:
1. use Microsoft exchange for email and scheduling, and so I needed to run Windows
2. use one of those large printer/copier/scanner/collating/faxing monstrosities, and it lacks a working mac driver

Of course, there's a slew of word and powerpoint files to deal with as well, but these can be handled with Office for Mac or OpenOffice.  Of course, once running Windows anyway for the two reasons above, I prefer to use native Office apps, because that way I'm 100% the files will be compatible (and plus, I end up having to open them on the Windows side to print them anyway).

My initial impressions of VMware Fusion 2 were very positive.  It was easy to install, and the interface is very clean.  While it's not 100% fair to compare VMware Fusion 2 to the older version of Parallels 3.0 in terms of performance, it is fair to compare things like interface and usability -- and in these areas, VMware wins, in my opinion.  I'll give the blanket caveat up front: Parallels may have fixed some of these things in newer versions ... I'll try to get a copy of Parallels v4.0 and do a follow-up review.

VMware's 'unity' puts windows apps side by side with Mac apps (much like Parallel's 'Coherence').  When in 'unity' mode, you have the option to show the windows task bar, which plunks the ugly windows bar behind the Mac's dock.  My dock fills the center 70% of my screen, so the Start Menu and the goofy windows tool tray are nice and visible on the far-left and far-right of the screen.  However, because I use virtual screens (Mac's ""spaces"" feature), and because VMware is bound to one of those screens, I run in full-screen mode -- if I have to switch spaces to get to my PC apps anyway, I don't want the ugly conflict between taskbar & dock.

Networking was so clean I almost forgot to include it in this review: it just worked, piggy-backing my Mac's network connections without requiring any action on my part.  Digging in, it offers direct network connections as well as private networking (the PC is only available to the Mac).  Nice options, but what's even nicer is I didn't even notice they were there.

Performance is amazing for a VM ... even before enabling access to both processors and boosting the default 512MB of memory to 1GB.  The only slow-down on the Mac side occurs during a windows boot (or re-boot as is more often the case) ... otherwise, Windows can sit, used or ignored, running on the mac without any noticeable performance degradation to Mac apps.",Windows Under Glass,1227225600,81.0,

As a long-time user of Corel's ""Graphics Suite"" bundle of graphics software, this is my first experience with their Photo/Video bundle, even though I have also previously used both the separate ""VideoStudio Pro X2"" and ""PaintShop Pro Photo X2"" packages.  What makes this bundled package so attractive is that for a very competitive price (especially now that their X4 versions are released), you get a set of very useful software for editing both photos and videos.

PaintShop Photo Pro X3 continues to improve ever since Corel acquired it from Jasc Software in 2004, and the new X3 version offers better RAW support along with new features for manipulating and carving objects out from an image and scaling images.  Of course, PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is not Photoshop, but it is also farrrrrr more user-friendly to photo enthusiasts who just want easy-to-use options for correcting and enhancing their photos without lots of fuss.  There are lots of cool, useful, interesting, or sometimes strange special effects that you can apply to your photos, ranging from giving people suntans to removing facial blemishes and age wrinkles to even making people look skinnier (a timely special effect, considering the population obesity that is on the rise).  Although not a huge improvement and rework of the X2 version, PaintShop Photo Pro X3 continues to enhance its ""Photoshop For The Masses"" approach to photo editing.

As for VideoStudio Pro X3, I previously used VideoStudio Pro X2 and I really liked its ""Movie Wizard"" mode as a wonderful way to ease the learning curve and let you create professional-looking videos quickly for instant gratification.  The X3 version improves upon X2 with new filters and templates.

Corel Painter Essentials 4 provides a fun limited subset of the functionality found in the full ""Painter"" software.  ""Painter"" occupies a very unique niche in its ability to manipulate photos and turn them into images that look like oil paintings, watercolors, pastels, and pencil sketches.  I also have ""Corel Painter 11"" and there are sometimes photos and situations where Painter's abilities cannot be replicated by any other photo editing software (yes, not even by using the full-blown Photoshop).  One of my favorite ways to use Corel Painter is to convert a landscape photo or portrait into a French Impressionist painting; either printing this out or displaying it on a Web page always gets compliments.

As with Corel's Graphic Suite (I have their X4 version), the software comes with printed User Guides, a 137-page PaintShop Pro X3 User Guide, a 155-page VideoStudio Pro X3 User Guide, and a separate ""Getting Started Guide"" for both of these too. I like a combination of a printed User Guide along with more detailed searchable help information that is accessed from within the software, and I could never understand software companies who just have a lone CD floating around in a cardboard box without including hardcopy guides/documentation or, even worse, software that requires you to be connected to the Internet because all the documentation is posted on an external Web site.  Compared with each of Corel's Graphic Suite applications (i.e. Corel Draw and Corel Photo-Paint), the applications in Photo and Video Pro X3 feel like they run a bit slower.  PaintShop Photo Pro X3, in particular, seems to feel slower with each new version as it incorporates new features.  You definitely need at least 2-GB of memory on your computer, and it would help if you shut down other applications if you are performing extended photo and video editing.  I am sometimes amazed at the amount of software and processes that people have constantly running on their computers.  Of course, some of these processes and Windows services were piled on as new software got loaded onto their computer.",Great value-packed bundle of software for photos and video.,1321315200,,

As successful as this low-end product has become, it has one flaw: it retains the steep learning curve of its big brother. I am of two minds here. As a powerful stand-alone 2D package, AutoCAD LT 2012 has a depth of capability that few will use completely. That depth deserves some learning (or better yet, professional training). Makers of other high end packages have successfully built low-end tools that are easier to learn: Adobe Photoshop Elements comes to mind. But Elements provides only a small subset of the functionality of Photoshop, unlike AutoCAD LT 2012, which provides virtually the entire AutoCAD feature set (except 3D).

So if you need a 2D drafting package with flawless AutoCAD compatibility, AutoCAD LT 2012 is literally perfect. But if you don't use AutoCAD already, you will need training, or at the very least a good book!",Why Compromise? AutoCAD for your Laptop/Customers/Contractors,1306540800,3.0,

The full review:
More to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.  In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.

So what exactly are you getting here?

This package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called ""OneDrive"" (formerly known as ""SkyDrive"") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.

It's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.

This package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.

Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (""the Cloud"", a.k.a., ""on the Internet"") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the ""Kanban"" look that you also see in Windows 8's ""Metro-now-called-Modern"" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.

My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.

You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose ""Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.

The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.
The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.
The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.

Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or ""bonus feature"" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.",Times have changed,1446076800,39.0,

So far I'm really enjoying this software.  After 3 weeks I'm still discovering more that it can do!

I am using Windows 7 with Firefox as my browser and ran into no major problems other than having to share my son's Norton account since he was the first one in our family to install it, hence the suggestion to have a separate email account for this product.

Looking back over my use of  MS Windows products for nearly 30 years, I would never have rated any release higher than ""3."" This is because Microsoft's corporate culture is marketing-driven, not quality-driven. Its products are pushed out the door much too quickly, and many of the security vulnerabilities, bugs, and undesirable ""features"" are never fixed. What's more--customers get whiplash from Microsoft's constantly ripping up the user interfaces to which customers have become accustomed, and replacing them with something far different and non-intuitive.  This costs customers time and frustration, and businesses money in lost productivity. Add to those problems the registry--a cumbersome, unreliable cornerstone of this system, and frustration and loss of productivity are guaranteed. From my perspective, the only reason for using Windows is that its software is ubiquitous--if you want to do application x and want to share it with user y, you tend to be in the Windows trap.

Although Windows 8 is better than some (such as the infamous Vista), it still has bugs. Such as the one that prevents some laptops from completely shutting down and powering off. Even the implementation of several ""fixes""--some by Microsoft, some by others--failed to fix this problem on a Lenovo laptop. Restarts and shutdowns will reach a point where the machine is doing nothing for an extended period, and yet it is still powered on. You must manually power it off, then on again.

No software can do the hard work for you of training your brain to recognize sounds, training your tongue to make them, and learning an entirely new set of vocabulary. But Rosetta Stone tries to make this process fun, intuitive, and simple. When you are trying to do something as difficult as learning another language, you don't need other difficulties thrown in your path. Attending a traditional class--driving, reading books, studying flash cards, interacting with other people who know the language just as poorly as you do--in my opinion introduces many more difficulties into the language learning process and is the cause of many people's failure to advance. If this is you, I recommend Rosetta Stone, which will allow you to advance beyond beginner level in a language in the comfort of your own home, using your own computer and the provided headset and microphone. When compared with the cost of taking a traditional course along with drive time and cost of books, Rosetta Stone's value becomes apparent.

Rosetta Stone is fun. At times, it can feel like a video game. The program does a good job of continuously challenging both your vocabulary and your tongue (as you have to pronounce the words more or less accurately) without being so difficult as to be dishearteningly discouraging.

Rosetta Stone immediately immerses the learner in the world of the language trying to make you forget your mother tongue (in my case English) as much as possible as you learn. This is, as far as I can tell, the best way to make oneself truly fluent. It is the way that I learned Spanish (total immersion), and in my opinion Rosetta Stone does as good of a job of that in a computer setting as I could imagine using today's technology.

I recommend purchasing levels 1, 2, & 3 together in a set so that you can advance far enough to actually begin intelligent conversations with native speakers. Rosetta Stone will only be able to advance you to a point, getting you out of beginner status. But to move on from there to fluent, will most definitely require surrounding yourself with people who speak the target language. But I am aware of no better value than Rosetta Stone to make that transition into another culture and language possible. I am looking forward to taking the next step.

I do have  word of caution from my experience regarding Windows Vista 64-bit software and Rosetta Stone's technical support. I was able to ""successfully"" install the software but unable to load any of the language modules into the software. After multiple calls (3+ hours) to technical support with a wide range of suggestions, I was finally told that Rosetta Stone is not supported on Vista 64 bit. This is somewhat frustrating and will likely be an issue more many purchasers of newer computers. I have read in reviews and blogs that some have been able to make it work, but I was unable to. I ended up having to install it on a secondary (and older) computer system. This was an inconvenience and something that I personally feel is an inexcusable oversight for high-end software. For lack of 64-bit support and the slowness of technical support to identify this issue, I have dropped my rating of the software from 5 stars to 4 stars.",Excellent Value & Great Way to Learn Language; Warning Regarding 64-Bit Windows Vista,1239840000,13.0,

It is what I typed my first reports in.  I craft my first term papers and kept notes in it, and did some of my first statistical analysis and graphing using Quattro Pro.  Then I got a real job and joined the corporate world and found the ubiquity of Microsoft Office.  And I had to learn Word, Excel, and Power Point etc.  And while Microsoft Office is the standard, and you find it almost everywhere, I find myself missing WordPerfect and the other programs often.
WordPerfect is still and amazingly powerful word processor.  It may not look as pretty as Word, but it has a lot less hiccups and once you learn the basic workings it makes it much easier to format documents then Word.  Word in all its wisdom to try and figure out what it is you are trying to do does a lot of auto-formatting and getting it to stop can be tough, WordPerfect makes that much easier and much more straight forward, I imagine that is one reason it is so like by the legal profession.
Quattro Pro has all the processing power of Excel in my opinion, pretty much every function you have in Excel you have in QP.  But it does have access to the add-in that you get with Excel, and so you lose some points there.  But if you don't have any fancy add-ins you can do your spreadsheet work and save in Excel format and everything works just the same on the other side.
The Presentations X8 program is okay.  For basic presentations it works very similar to PowerPoint, and can save in the PowerPoint format.  Takes a little while to figure out but it works well.  To be honest I don't do many presentations, so I will have to update when I have more to say on this one.

I got this for my first and third graders to learn how to type.  The third grader has had a few basic lessons at school, and this program is working well with what he's doing there.  He already knew the ""home keys"", and so the lessons on learning the letters that go with the fingers were perfect for him.  He was already doing some of that, so MB is great reinforcement and extra practice for him.  He is improving steadily, and is starting to use proper form when using the computer.

The first grader on the other hand, has never had any typing lessons before.  The concept of the home keys is new to him, and it isn't really emphasized very much by MB.  He rushed through to get to the actual typing lessons, but was just using whichever fingers were easy for him to do *fast*, so I stopped him.  We'll try it again in another year or so - I think he's just too young for this particular program.  So, the ""ages 8 to adult"" on the package is probably right on target!

All in all, Mavis is as good as ever, and teaching a skill that is critical to life in the world today.  Some other comments, off the top of my head:
- This program has audio - just about everything is read aloud.  Unfortunately, on my computer (not the fastest), the audio lagged a little bit, and isn't as helpful as it could be.
- The videos that show you what each lesson is about - seem to be there just so they can say they have videos, because they really are just showing the lesson.  Watch the video, do the lesson, same difference!

Installation was quick and easy. WinZip has been the consumer standard for compression, and they have branched out and separated the software into various editions including a Courier for email, a self extractor, utilities malware protection and so on. This review covers the standard edition, WinZip 17. This standard has a lot of great new features that make it more useful than ever. WinZip can now convert doc, docx (Word files), xls, xlsx (Excel files) and ppt, pptx (PowerPoint files) by selecting the Convert to PDF box in the Create tab and simply dragging your document into the work area. That alone is fantastic. By selecting options beforehand, you can encrypt your files (Winzip wipes and deletes any temporary files so they cannot be recovered, great protection option). You can right click and create zip files straight from Windows Explorer, sort columns by clicking on headers, processes files such as RAR, 7Z, ISO, IMG, BZ2, BZ, TBZ,TBZ2, TAR, Z, GZ, TGZ, LZH, LHA, CAB, UUencode, BinHex & MIME files. There are even iOS & Android apps for Apple & Google devices. You can resize images (great for compressing large photos). You can even add Watermarks to your Files with the extensions of BMP, GIF, JPG, PDF, PNG and TIF. The toolbars are very easy to use and are context sensitive, adapting to the task you are working on. Another great new feature is sharing with your social media accounts. You can post any type of file to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn with ZipShare. You can also send large files up to 2GB from your email account with ZipSend.  For me the best new feature is the access to cloud files. WinZip will connect to Dropbox, SkyDrive, Box and Google Drive. You can save a ton of space by zipping files to your cloud accounts or extracting to them. File compression can be customized to your specifications and is quick and fast. I love being able to convert documents to quick PDFs (no it doesn't have the features of Acrobat or Create PDF, but it gets the job done if you need an Office document converted to share or send). The Cloud integration is excellent. Just link WinZip to the service or services you use and you can zip or extract to them in a few minutes. WinZip makes the setup for this a breeze. This is particularly good for large size files or photos since extra space costs $$. I have used WinZip before and this new edition is the best ever. While many complain about the cost, WinZip is really an excellent product. I have tried several other compression programs like 7Zip (shareware) and Power Archiver. 7Zip for me is a great hassle. We have it at work and it is useless because even though it is installed on some machines, co-workers have a difficult time opening files so I never use it. When we had WinZip, everything ran smoothly. It may not be the most advanced compression option, the Pro Version has more advanced features, but it is certainly the easiest to use and the new features make it worth it. Connection  to the Cloud drives and quick PDF conversion are the features I use most often and it is fast and easy. There is also plenty of help available if needed and you can right click for more options. I highly recommend WinZip 17, Corel has stepped up their game for usefulness.

While no product is perfect, I personally think TT is pretty consistently a good piece of software at a reasonable price.  Intuit (like many other companies) plays games with licensing and features and versions, which annoy me as much as anyone else, but that doesn't make the product terrible.  BTW, if you have a tax situation that is more complex than you can handle, tax software isn't going to help you figure things out.  You'll either need to educate yourself (books & IRS website), or find a tax accountant.

As I do every year, I'll try to write a balanced review based on my own experience.  Note that I've been a user of tax software for many years, and have in the past used the competition's products as well.

Initial Review 6 Dec 2015

This is my first report, which I will update down the road after I've made more progress.

Initial download from Amazon and installation was completely trouble-free (Windows 7 64-bit).  No problems with warnings, glitches, updates, or anything else.  The only oddity (minor) was that after the initial updates it failed to automatically start the program, after saying it would.  When I did start it up, it quickly found the various copies of my 2014 tax files (I save versions as I go, in case I make a serious error and need to roll back).  Imports from the file I selected were clean and trouble-free.  My tax situation this year includes self-employment income, investment income, foreign income (not just mutual funds), itemized deductions, college expenses, 529 fund payouts, and Roth conversions.

The interview hasn't changed much that I noticed.  I switched back and forth between the interview and the forms view, as I often do, to understand what was going on under the covers.  It didn't take too long for me to enter all my current numbers (many of them estimates, of course) and get a sense of my full tax picture.  For state taxes, TT had already started on my state return (based on my home state), but asked me to confirm that it was the free state I wanted to use (extra states have additional cost, e.g., if you live and work in different states).  The state tax return was also trouble-free and looked correct.

Two glitches to report so far, hopefully these will be corrected.  Both are related to college costs, and both can cost you real money.
(1) My son's college charges a required fee that it doesn't include in the 1098T.  It's a qualified expense for the 529 fund, and there's a place for it on the form, but TT doesn't ask for it or allow it during the interview.  You sort of have to know the mechanics and go into the right form to add this item.  Not user-friendly, and can lead to higher taxes than you owe.  Bad.
(2) The ""optimization"" of the various education credits is terrible, and can lead to bad results if you let the program do what it chooses.  In my case TT reserved a huge part of the 529 funds withdrawn for the AOC (don't worry if you don't know what that is), which led to some of it becoming taxable.  There was no optimization -- I was able to do much better with simple trial-and-error.  Bad.

One other thing I noticed:  there doesn't appear to be a simple way to find and correct the health insurance figure (in the business income section).  It's hard to find in the interview, and I couldn't find a way to change it in the forms (ran into a circular reference between two forms each saying go change the other one).  This part of the program hasn't changed from last year.  Not a big problem, just something to be aware of.

Overall, I'm satisfied.  Still a reasonable program for the money, still does a decent job at reducing my tax computation and filing hassles.

Update 22 Feb 2016:

Overall I'm still reasonably happy with TT.  Some specific comments:

(1) The college fees issue I mentioned above is still in the software, which I think means that it will ""never"" be corrected.  It's important to enter this data correctly, obviously.  Further, it might affect your state tax as well: in MA, it matters in the computation of the college tuition deduction.

(2) The optimization of the American Opportunity Credit is now corrected, it works the way it should.

(3) I had a problem with the MA tuition deduction calculation works -- in my first run in December this wasn't done correctly by TT, so it over-indicated (by more than $2000) how much I would gain from this.  So now I find that I'm paying the state instead of getting a refund.  Would have been nice to know that before I had to pay my Jan estimated tax installment.

(4) The handling of Form 1116 (for foreign tax credit) is very poorly implemented.  TT prompts you during error checking to fill in some required ""explain this line"" forms, instead of doing so during the interview.  Also, the explanations are usually so simple that TT has the information needed to pre-fill these in, instead of asking the user to hunt down where the numbers came from.  Also, if you're not careful, Form 1116 might calculate your foreign tax credits incorrectly, by excluding certain foreign income.  I've found that one MUST review this form manually and make corrections directly in the form and in the relevant 1099 forms, in order to make sure everything is done correctly.  (I've been doing this for years now, there's been no improvement here.)",TT remains a pretty good tax prep software package,1449360000,56.0,

R.,"Up until several years ago I was a high school teacher, and one of the classes that I taught was Digital Graphics & Animation. Back when I was teaching, I was a bit envious of the middle-school teachers that also taught this subject. One of the software programs that they used for their classes was the Honestech Claymation Animation package. I always wanted a chance to play with it - but never got it. The classes I taught, we did 3D CGI animation and 2D flash-based animation. I think the main reason I was so interested in the stop-motion animation was due to my having attempted that sort of thing back in the mid-70's when I was a high school student (I was a big fan of the Gumby cartoons). Course back then you had to use super-8 film cameras and it took a lot of time and effort to get something good. Nowadays, with the software and technology available today - even young children can make some really neat videos and it doesn't have to cost a whole lot of money.

This software is very easy to use, the controls are very simplified and all you need besides the software is a computer and a webcam. I tried two different cameras, one a regular webcam (Logitech C615) and one of the U-create Games and Artimation devices. I had much better results with the HD webcam than I did with the low-resolution camera on the U-Create unit, but the results with the lesser camera really wasn't that bad. What you can do with these is limited to your imagination and what props and material you have on hand.

So, if you have some children who like to be creative and have a computer and a detachable webcam this would be the prefect summer activity (or winter) to keep them busy and maybe teach them something in the process. If you go that route, and want to be a bit educational - search the web for lesson plans and instructions handouts, like I mentioned there are teachers out there using software like this with their students.",Very easy to use.,1396137600,,

As I understand the speech engine is same as Dragon Naturallyspeaking, but somehow, the performance does not transfer to the Mac version - and this is version 5!

Most software for Mac has better user interface compared to Windows software; but in Dragon's case, it is the other way round. Mac version is not user-friendly and difficult to use, installation is very tortuous, takes a long time, and instead of starting with your previous version 4.0 profile, prompts you to start all over again with a new profile. And then program repeatedly hangs up and freezes. Does not work well with Google Docs, Evernote and Microsoft Office on the web.

But I must say, compared to Dragon Dictate version 4.0, it is a little faster and the accuracy is better. The user experience is not any better though. Dragon microphone window is very obtrusive.

I have used Windows Dragon Naturallyspeaking for 15 years and to me Dragon for Mac 5 is difficult to use, buggy, slow to start and the correction accuracy does not come close to Windows version. If you use speech recognition for work or use extensively then I would recommend Windows Dragon Naturallyspeaking.

Windows 8 is a completely new approach to using Windows and it hampers function for desktop users to assist tablet users.  Windows 7 and XP users will be frustrated and often lost.

Microsoft was negligent and typically arrogant in not providing an alternative choice to select a more intuitive Windows 7 like interface option under Windows 8 for desktop users.  If you are so frustrated with Windows 8  that you are ready to reinstall Windows 7 over Windows 8  or return your new computer for a Windows 7 version, a good application that makes Windows 8 a little more usable and makes it operate more like windows 7 is called Classic Shell and is a free download (another ap is Pokki).  Ironically, Windows 7 computers are not any cheaper, although they are being clearance out, because of the high learning curve with Windows 8 and associated preference of desktop users (as apposed to tablet users) for Windows 7.

On the positive side, Windows 8 is more compact and a little faster and a little less buggy than Windows 7 (why it got one more star than one only).

On one hand, WordPerfect Office offers a powerful and very capable alternative to Microsoft Office. As multiple reviewers have already noted, if you really care about a document's layout the ""Alt + F3"" ""Reveal Codes"" feature is pretty much worth the cost of the purchase.

But the X8 version is not really all that different from the last version I used (X4). And what new features have been added pretty much apply to the Standard or Professional version of WPOX8 and not this one (Home & Student). At this point, I have to add that the ""Home and Student"" edition reviewed here is NOT the same as WPOX8 Academic (more on that in a bit).

So what does one get for $99 (Amazon price at the time of this review)? You get the essentials and they are: the WordPerfect document processor (equivalent to MS Word), Quattro Pro spreadsheet (equivalent to MS Excel), Presentations (equivalent to MS PowerPoint), Lightning (equivalent to MS OneNote), and the AfterShot 2 photo processing app. That's it, but that's probably enough for most folks. (Interestingly, Corel offers a stripped down version of this product -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Office-5-3-Installs/dp/B006N1Q0W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Office 5 - 3 Installs</a>&nbsp;(essentially, the Corel version of MS Works) - and I can't help but wonder if, at $30, Corel is hurting WPO sales by offering Office (though I suspect Corel hopes Office will be a stepping stone to WPO)).

For me, the sweet spot (as it pertains to features is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-WordPerfect-Office-X8-Standard/dp/B01EB06R10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel WordPerfect Office X8 Standard</a>. But for some reason Corel puts it out of reach by pricing it at $250. I guess there must be some logic, but I'm not following. If you can qualify for the Academic Edition that's the way to go. For $80 you get WPOX8 Professional (which adds the Paradox database application) for less than this Home & Student Edition. Disappointingly, the Perfect Authority ""table of authorities"" feature is an add-on (at $199) for the Standard and Professional versions; perhaps even more disappointingly, Perfect Authority won't work with this (Home & Student) edition.

If Corel really wants to keep a foothold with the ""next gen"" of users it HAS to update the interface; the software still looks like it did a decade (or more) ago. Frankly, this looked good when WFWG 3.11 was the current OS (and that was 1993)! What with folks moving away from WPO years ago and now folks moving away from the desktop/laptop entirely, Corel has got to do something to refresh the look. Even the free, Open Source LibreOffice has updated its look. It amazes me is that it's the cheaper, less capable product - Corel Office - that uses a MS Word ribbon interface that is far more modern and user-friendly (to the eyes) than WPOX8. So if Corel believes WPO can survive because lawyers still like the pleading and authorities features, okay. But I think it is ultimately a losing strategy.

WordPerfect, despite its looks, is - I believe - a superior product to MS Word (if it matters to you what your document looks like behind the scenes). I have used both since the late 1980s and know that you can do more with the former than latter. Quattro Pro is equally as capable as Excel at most basic tasks, but the world is Excel-based (so most work in QP will have to be ""translated"" for use in Excel). Finally, I think Presentations is a better presenting app than PowerPoint, but once again, the world is PowerPoint-centric. Of the three, the least difficult to transition output over to an MS Office-centric world is WordPerfect (which is fortunate as WP is the reason I think most people buy this suite). Even if this is the case, don't discount the other two: I learned spreadsheets on QP and found it a bit easier to understand the concept of spreadsheets on QP than I did on Excel; same with Presentations (easier to use initially; which is kind of a hoot considering WP's long-standing reputation of having a steep learning curve!).

After Shot 2 is a full version photo editing/adjusting application. I don't do a whole lot of work with photos so my impressions are those of an amateur. But from all appearances it appears to be a comprehensive, full-featured app. It is, however, 1 version behind; the most current version is 3.x (which you will learn about when closing version 2 and being shown an offer to upgrade to version 3 for $49.

One last thought. Usually ""user help"" is an after-thought; the mind set these days seems to be that if you can't figure it out, do an internet search or buy an after-market book. It's pleasing to see Corel not going that route; the Corel Reference Center utility is superb.

Summary: 4 stars. Functional, powerful, capable, at $99 you get a great program at a reasonable price and one that doesn't require an email account to activate and keep active. A 5-star bit of software. But it looks so, so, so old; WPO is in drastic need of a facelift. And the features added to make WPOX8 better than previous offerings is slim. The old look and minimal reasons to upgrade earn -1 star. So while I really want to support Corel's latest edition of WPO, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I think the optimal way to go (if you can't get the Academic version) is either to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordPerfect-Office-X7-Standard/dp/B00JC5Y6WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordPerfect Office X7 Standard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Wordperfect-Office-X7-Home-Student-Product-Key-Card/dp/B00YYCI98K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Wordperfect Office X7 Home & Student - Product Key Card</a>. At $140 you get a more powerful suite in WPOX7 Standard than WPOX8 H&S and don't really miss anything for $40 more than WPOX8 H&S. If one decides to go the H&S route, WPOX7 Home & Student comes in at $40 and is essentially identical to WPOX8 H&S (but less than half the cost). Like I said, not sure I'm following Corel's pricing strategies; to me, Corel has to do something if it wants WPO to remain a viable product.

I work almost exclusively in classic desktop mode, but am finding myself using the modern UI more and more when I'm browsing around, looking at news, etc. Now if they took away the classic desktop, I wouldn't be at all happy.
The biggest change for me in 8.1 is allowing you to configure the computer to start up in classic desktop mode. That's a big time saver. I really didn't care about, or miss the Start Button that much (OK, full disclosure, maybe a little!).

General:
Back-up status is right on the front page. It tells you the last backup date and time, so you know when you are up to date.
QB Help Center - a realtime help bar with frequently asked questions in the form of a member forum. Find quick solutions from people like you who are using the same software.
QB Connect - access your company data, record payments, and make invoices from any internet device - even a smartphone!
Clean-up Company Data - lets you enter an ""as of"" date to clean closed transactions and enters them as monthly summary journal entries, to greatly clear up your company file.
Search Feature - tons of options to find exactly what you are looking for, and fast!
List Import - import lists from Excel, including customer and vendor lists with address and phone number.
Attach Feature - Allows you to scan directly into QB and attach to anything with the paperclip icon. Scan in a cancelled check copy and attach it to the paid bill; scan in important documents and attach it to an employee file; scan notes on a project and attach it to a vendor/customer.
Before closing - QB gives you a ""are you sure"" prompt to prevent accidental closure of the software.

IMPRESSIONS:
The Firewall has undergone major improvement.  It is less obtrusive than the previous version, automatically creating rules for trusted programs/access without bothering you with any annoying 'stop everything and attend to me' pop-ups.  The Computer Scanner interface tab now shines for its easy to use scheduling of single or multiple scans, manual scans of your computer, or manual scans of just selected files.  The Virus Vault and the History could still use some work, but they are perfectly functional as is.

I cannot use Vista because of accessibility problems so I have to use XP.

2008-05-08
The Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3 makes changes to XP that severely affect accessibility for people with some forms of epilepsy. I suspect that Microsoft is partially trying to install some Vista style features ( ripped off from Apple ). In particular, I have seen Apple style ""sliding down"" menu boxes or whatever they are called. As an example, open the ""control panel"" applet. BEFORE, it was accessible, NOW, the elements at the top of the left column ""slide"" down. I had enough bad seizures ( bad in this case means very unpleasant - I can actually feel them in my brain ) that, after experimenting trying to disable this abomination, at had to get away from the computer.

For people like me, my computer is my lifeline. Since Macs are absolutely not accessible, we are stuck with Microsoft Windows XP. Vista is absolutely not accessible, as is Leopard, etc. With Microsoft destroying the minimal accessibility of XP, there is nowhere to go.

IF YOU DECIDE TO INSTALL SP3 - FULLY BACKUP YOUR COMPUTER SO YOU CAN REVERT TO SP2 IF YOU HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. ( I have two notebooks; if I cannot figure out a workaround, then I will never be able to install SP3 )

BTW, I review so that other people like me can find information about products to avoid and so that they can realize that the problems that they are having are common to other people. There is essentially no accessibility any more. It is so bad that it is only a matter of years before we can no longer live in this society due to blinking, flashing, etc.

Workaround:
Control Panel | System | Advanced | Performance - SETTINGS
Unclick EVERYTHING that allows animation, fading, sliding, etc. I am not sure how comprehensive this will be but it helps.

BTW, FULL accessibility demands that the display be totally ""quiet"" as far as any unnecessary motion or blinking. Unnecessary features that make Windows XP inaccessible are, in particular, ""progress bars"", animations for copying files. Microsoft Word has major accessibility problems. The animations associated with spell checking ( the IDIOT animated book icon at the bottom of the screen - every time you type the animations start. Also, the rippling red underline when Word autocapitalizes. MICROSOFT - GO AWAY )",Re: Service Pack 3 for Windows XP Pro,1210204800,3.0,

I found the interface to be fairly intuitive and very similar to what I am accustomed to in MS Office. I liked the fact that I can import Microsoft documents into WordPerfect. Unfortunately for some reason it refuses to import one document I use almost daily although it will import a similar file. I also found that creating tables works a bit differently but I am certain that with a little concentrated effort I will figure that one out. I also like that I can save documents as pdf files. I have used the PDF plugin for both MS Word and Publisher so am quite happy to retain that function.

Overall, I would say that WordPerfect Office X7 contains all the features I use on a regular basis with the comparable Microsoft product. It will require just a bit of familiarization to become proficient in using it but that is not really a negative detail.

Capture cards typically came bundled with software for capturing, editing and producing video in DVD and other formats. The most common ones at the time were Pinnacle Studio and Ulead Video Studio. Ulead is now part of Corel, and is sold as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-VideoStudio/dp/B00BFYEH8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel VideoStudio</a>. That product has evolved quite a bit, and is still a good choice. I reviewed it separately as part of Corel Photo Video Suite X6. Pinnacle evolved quite a bit too, and this version is a departure from previous versions. I never used version 16, but compared to version 15 and below, this version has a substantially different interface. Its old one was centered around the paradigm of the steps mentioned above, which was common for Video Studio and also for Cyberlink Power Director. Others such as Sony took a fresh approach, and this is a fresh approach for Pinnacle.

The new interface is cleaner and more powerful. I can now edit far more video tracks, rendering is much faster, and many features have been added. Unfortunately, while video editing software seemed to be the last software product around that still came with a hard copy manual, Corel has dropped it for both this and Video Studio. I suppose if you have a Kindle, you can get by with the PDF, but you most likely want your full computer screen for running the product itself. I found the PDF manual to be lacking, and some very simple things are not documented. Thus the learning curve was greater than I expected, even though once I learned it, it was easy to use.

The newest features are useful and practical, but there is also an increasing array of features that go far beyond what I'll ever need. In past versions, I often failed to see why I need hundreds of new transitions and more title backgrounds than I'd care to look at when I'll only use a handful, but if you are looking for a special title slide or want to have effects similar to the wipes, fades, pans, folds and spins of an over the top sports broadcast, you can do that too.

The product is still well suited for getting those old Digital8 or MiniDV tapes off the shelf and putting them on line, but it's even better suited to giving you the features necessary to work with your full HD videos and render things in any popular format or burn to a Blu-ray disc. It will also handle 3D videos. It won't handle subtitles the way Cyberlink will and you'd have to rely on standard titles for that. But the interface is much cleaner than something like Cyberlink's, which tries to upsell itself.

I've found it particularly useful when multiple video cameras are used at the same event and I wish to cut from one angle to another but have a cohesive video with no breaks in action or dialog. But the same editing capabilities come in handy even with lesser quality video, and my video review shows how I was able to salvage bits and pieces of videos to come up with something better.

Whether you merely want to take a collection of video clips and put them together, adding transitions and little more, or whether you want to edit multiple videos together with fancy titles rolling credits and Blu-Ray disc menus with a different moving background for each scene selection, you can do it with this product. The PLUS version of the product doesn't have all the features of the Ultimate version, so I suggest you check the feature comparison chart. I suspect that for most users, this will work fine, especially if you save your videos on your computer or want to watch them on line. If you want to burn things to Blu-Ray disc or want support for 4K ultra HD, the Ultimate version will be better for you.",Powerful but a lot to learn,1392854400,,
