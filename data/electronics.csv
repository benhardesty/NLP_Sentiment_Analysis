A 15 inch screen is not large, but this can be just the ticket for a small space such as the one in which I am using it on my boat. The picture is very sharp and crisp when I play movies on it through the iPhone using the HDMI port. The DVD player is adequate. The sound is not all that terrific but many users will do as I do and use outboard speakers. As it happens, my boat has a very nice built-in speaker system and it is very easy to simply play this TV through those speakers. I suspect most users will come up with a solution along these lines.

For the price, it is hard to have too many nits or criticisms of this TV. It does what it is supposed to do. One minor nit is that when you insert a DVD the TV does not automatically switch to DVD mode, you have to do that manually. Not a big deal but other TVs that I have had that had built-in DVD players automatically switch when you insert a DVD.  Like all LED flatscreen TVs viewing angle matters and if you are watching TV on this unit you will want to be directly in front of it if possible.

411,1248,8884,225262,225262,B004YIFOZ0,,4.0,"* Easy to follow instructions:
Not sure what the other 1 star reviewer was talking about, something about cheap instruction stickers that are directly on the protective screen(film), ruining the protective film when she tried to remove it. Just like another reviewer had stated, each film has a clear mask on each side when it is new, and yes, they look like cheap instruction stickers on the mask, but they are on the mask and NOT on the actual protective film. On the masks, one side says ""Step 1, clean tablet before applying film"", on that same side of the mask, another sticker says ""peel off this mask before applying the film"". Once you are done applying the film properly onto the screen, the mask on the other side of the film says ""peel off this mask AFTER film is positioned correctly"". Anyway, the instructions were very easy to follow.

* Thickness
It is 0.13 mm thick, feels thick, should help with accidental scratching.

* Problem
I did run into a problem, when trying to put on the first film. I cleaned the screen as instructed, I only applied about 2 inches of the film, using the smoothing card to remove the bubbles, then noticed a single bubble that would not go away, right below the camera, looked like there was a tiny speck of dirt under the film, causing the bubble, I pulled the film off and checked the film and screen, there was nothing visible, so I tried putting the film back on, same issue, got frustrated and crumbled the film and threw it out. Grabbed the second film, same exact problem, got frustrated and threw that out. So I decided to use the tablet without a screen protector. I did whip the screen by breathing on it and using your typical bath towel, without any scratches. So far, the tablet screen seems as durable as the screen on the iPod, which I never used a screen protector, and I whip the hell out of it with my shirt for over a year, without a single scratch. Oh well, wasted money on this, but it is not the product's fault, as far as I can tell. Since I've never had a screen protector on my iPod and I let my 4 yr old son play with it, since he was about 2.5 yrs old, and there is not a single scratch, I bought these for the tablet, mainly out of paranoia, just because of the brand new item mentality, kind of like having a brand new car, where you will baby the hell out of it at first.

* Star Rating
I'm giving this a 4 star, because I cannot say that I'm 100% sure that the problem was with the brand new screen protectors or not, since I was unable to see that single speck of dirt that may had been on the screen.

UPDATE 4/24/2013

132,2360,7927,603048,603048,B011WSX82A,,5.0,"This is a very good radar detector with some nice features you just won't find many, if any, other places.

Range: The range on this unit can be very good, especially on Ka Band. It will meet or exceed the range of many high end detectors and have excellent off-axis sensitivity to pick up radar signals that may not be directly in front of you. One note, K band range has tested good but not excellent. It has been sufficient in my area but is not on the same level as the Ka range. If K is not a big concern in your area, not issues. If K is your primary threat, you may want to consider its bigger brother the SE or another unit all together. For me it is a non issue and leads to less false alerts.

Filtering: Multiple options for filtering. Speed based muting keeps everything under a certain speed limit very quiet. One alert and then it mutes. Additional speed based city and auto city modes will lower sensitivity to X, K, and Ka bands based on your preference at a pre set speed (such as your typically speed limit in your area). Another level under that mutes everything completely. Good for parking lots and such (think 15 mph and lower). In addition it has two levels of TSR filtering. Most radar detectors only have one. Low adds a short delay to K band alerts to be sure that it is not a traffic filter or blind spot monitor system found on some newer cars. High makes the delay longer to accomplish the same thing. Use whichever works for you. The lower the better as the shorter delay allows the detector to respond more quickly.

GPS: This detector also has GPS lockout features built in. I don't personally use them as the GPS speed sensitive alerts referenced above are sufficient for me and I don't have to worry about accidentally locking out a real threat. Radenso is working on a firmware update to change the way lockouts are handled. In addition to lockouts, this detector offers Speed Camera, Redlight Camera, and Speed Trap Camera GPS alerts and the database is free (included with cost of detector). This is very important if these can be found in your area.

Additional PROS: The size. This this is tiny. Should be able to find a place for this thing in any vehicle. Other detectors that don't have GPS are much larger. The mount works very well. They are constantly improving this unit through downloadable firmware updates as well as the Speedcam, Redlightcam, and Speed Trap Database. They say they are enthusiast driven and are working hard on continuous improvement. That is a plus.

CONS: If I had to point out a few things that could be better. I sometimes have trouble viewing the screen wearing Polarized Sunglasses. This can be mitigated some by changing the angle or moving the location on the windshield. The power connector is a type typically seen on cheaper detectors, could have used a style similar to Escort, Beltronics, and Uniden. The case does not feel as substantial as the price tag might indicate. Not necessarily a huge deal as long as you didn't buy it to hold or stare at and admire.",good radar detector nice feature find many place range range unit good especially ka band meet exceed range many high end detector excellent axis sensitivity pick radar signal may directly front one note k band range tested good excellent sufficient area level ka range k big concern area issue k primary threat may want consider bigger brother se another unit together non issue lead le false alert filtering multiple option filtering speed based muting keep everything certain speed limit quiet one alert mute additional speed based city auto city mode lower sensitivity x k ka band based preference pre set speed typically speed limit area another level mute everything completely good parking lot think mph lower addition two level tsr filtering radar detector one low add short delay k band alert sure traffic filter blind spot monitor system found newer car high make delay longer accomplish thing use whichever work lower better shorter delay allows detector respond quickly gps detector also gps lockout feature built personally use gps speed sensitive alert referenced sufficient worry accidentally locking real threat radenso working firmware update change way lockout handled addition lockout detector offer speed camera redlight camera speed trap camera gps alert database free included cost detector important found area additional pro size tiny able find place thing vehicle detector gps much larger mount work well constantly improving unit downloadable firmware update well speedcam redlightcam speed trap database say enthusiast driven working hard continuous improvement plus con point thing could better sometimes trouble viewing screen wearing polarized sunglass mitigated changing angle moving location windshield power connector type typically seen cheaper detector could used style similar escort beltronics uniden case feel substantial price tag might indicate necessarily huge deal long buy hold stare admire,"12 29, 2015",A1XOBCHAAHEVV4,Chris,,"A very good detector, competes with the top tier in certain categories, offers some features not found elsewhere",1451347200,False,4.0,1

It turns out I was expecting too much for a small tube shaped camera.  The other cameras I have are the Ion Air Pro Lite, Sena Prism Tube and some other no-name tube cam not worth naming.  This cam by far has the most features.  Ion may have tried to cram too many features into this cam.  Not all the non essential features will work well, but I don't use them all anyway.  The ones I do use seem to work well.  This review will basically be a comparison with the Sena Prism Tube.  .

What the Air Pro 3 HAS, where the Prism Tube does not: Very wide viewing angle. Once accustomed to having this extra wide angle available, it's hard to live with a narrower angle.  You can select different recording resolutions, although I leave mine at 1080 / 30fps all the time. It takes still photos, actually pretty nice ones at 12 megapixels.  The Prism Tube does not take still shots.  It has a built-in mic, but also has a standard mic jack for an external mic.  So, you don't need a proprietary mic.  The Prism Tube has no built-in mic, and requires a proprietary mic.  It has image stabilization. I questioned if the stabilization was actually working for a while, but when comparing with the Prism Tube which does not have stabilization, I can tell it's working.  Video is also not distorted during vibration and movement.  The Prism Tube's image sometimes seems jagged or distorted.  It is water proof, not just water resistant.  You can take it underwater up to 3 meters as long as the rear cover is attached.  Color is pretty accurate in all lighting conditions.  With the Prism tube, bright lighting often can throws off color balance.

What this does NOT have that the Prism Tube does have:  It's at least 30% larger in diameter than the Prism Tube.  I wish they would have made this cam a little smaller instead of trying to pack too many features into it.  I don't need WiFi, social media sharing, etc.  It doesn't have a side mount for your helmet.  I had to make my own.  Underwater videos and images are blurry.  In all fairness, the Prism Tube can't even go underwater.  Sound quality, even with a good external mic is poor.  It doesn't seem to pick up low tones at all.

Yes, it adds weight and bulk, but I rather have it to protect the tablet from accidental bumps, scratches and drops, especially when my 4 yr old kid is playing with it. The case fits nice and snug. The only issue I have is that while the tablet is in this case, it's somewhat difficult to open the cover to the USB, HDMI ports, you have to really dig into it with your finger.

UPDATE 8/10/2011
After using it for about 10 days, I found that I rather use the tablet without this case, since I mostly use the tablet at home only. Don't need the extra protection and that the case makes the tablet feel too thick, the tablet feels so much thinner and lighter without this case.

The noise cancellation is not as complete as you can get with over-ear headphones, but it is still good and the convenience of earbuds is highly desired. In the lower price range many NC headphone designs are a compromise between noise cancellation and audio fidelity. But there is no point in buying headphones with poor audio. With the HC55 the price is right, the highs are bright and the lows are well defined.

To adjust the earbuds I put them on without an audio source and listen to refrigerator noise. When you get a close fit it is obvious the noise cancellation is highest. Then I plug in an audio source and get the realism I enjoy. Battery life seems almost infinitely long.

I use a Canon T3i camera and I do a lot of shooting but not every day.  I've taken about 4000 pictures in the last 10 months and I'm a member at Shutterfly.

I was able to get this working as I wanted it to after about 10 minutes of setup.  I'm not big on directions, and I didn't really need them.  I did look up the Relay Transfer function in the help though.

Stuff I like about this product
- Easy setup
- No need for cables to transfer pictures
- My wife can now upload pictures to shutterfly without me telling her she's doing it wrong :)
- My pictures are organized automatically by shooting date without the need for the clunky canon software to do it.

Stuff I don't like about this product
- Most settings have to be changed from the PC, with the card connected.  I can't make changes to it from my camera's screen.
- SD card dongle is rather large, would be better to use a corded USB design or ship with a USB cord to attach to it.

Overall, excellent product.  I like knowing that I can back up pictures from virtually anywhere, any time.  An example of how this is great, picture yourself on a honeymoon.  You've taken 400-1000 pictures in a couple of days. Your eye-fi card is relaying these pictures to your home computer every chance it can.  Your camera gets stolen/lost/dropped in water/falls into volcano/falls out of hot air balloon/etc.  It is unfortunate that you have to get a new camera, but you didn't lose many (if any) pictures.  If you have a smart phone that can act as a wifi hotspot you can literally shoot pictures and upload them live.
