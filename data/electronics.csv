1196,10084,89127,89127,B0014L6RH4,,4.0,"This is my first GPS but some of my friends are up to their 4th. I'm directionally challenged and always wanted one but the complaints of friends with GPS and the huge price tag made me wait it out. With all the upgraded features and prices dropping so much, I could not resist buying one. I've only been testing it in my neighborhood and to work but it's been accurate; 1 error in a street name but the SD map was from 2008. I called company, asked for the ""free"" latest map within their 30 day of purchase window.  Unfortunately, it's still 2009 since the 2010 won't be release until much later in the year; cost $10 for S/H to mail the SD map. Delivery was fast but now I need full charge before I can install the new software to use the new map. Since I only have the car charger and my drive to work is ~15 minutes, the battery still not max yet. I'll update after the upgrade and new map but the GPS is intuitive to use/program. I have no trouble figuring out the features, enter addresses and started using it out of the box.  Low volume is a major complaint of most GPS but with the radio on I still can hear this one clearly on max setting. Love the street names, turns announcements; no need to even look at the screen. It also have a bell alert immediately before each turn. The bright blue screen was easy to see in bright daylight too. One person complained it was too bright for night; the reviewer may not know about the brightness setting. Tried it myself, not a problem. I did not tried the free 3 month traffic subscription yet. My Miami commute is nothing compare to other major cities I've been in.

I was hesitant about this model with all the low reviews I saw here but since most were from 2008 and early 2009 and for the price ~$90 plus some very positive reviews, I was willing to risk it.  I think the company may have resolved the issues with upgrades, 30 days free map upgrade and better customer service. Like I said, I'll post my experience after the upgrade and new map to see if the company actually did fix the issues reported by some.  The customer service I got was excellent.

I'm happy with the price and features of this unit so far. I'm purcahsing a wall charger for this unit for $5. I already have a USB data link for the upgrade. If you live in a city where there were no major changes to the freeway, highways or roads the last few years then you can save money and not upgrade the map or simply wait for a later model with more current maps. GPS seem to be getting cheaper by the month.

UPDATE 04-Jul-10:
Got my wall charger last week and downloaded the software update so I can use the new 2009 SD map. The SD map came so quickly after I faxed Magellan the receipt with date of purchase, I had to wait for my wall charger because you'll need a fully charge unit first.  No problems with the download (took only a few minutes) but I had a problem after I inserted the new SD map.  It was my fault because I did not remove the plastic screen protector and it cause an error that took me more than 20 mins to figure out why it wasn't responding to touch or reset. Once I removed the screen protector, it reset and responded well to touch and so far no problems with the unit so I believe they fixed the software problem that others complained about.  The name error of the one street was still not corrected with the new map so save your money if you live in an area with no major changes to your roads in the last few years. Like other posters asked, do they really update those maps?!!

For the price and features, absolutely happy with the unit. None of my friends ever complained about the durability of a GPS so I think this unit will only be replaced in the future with a ""better"" unit or if the new maps at the current $80 are more expensive than buying a new unit.",first gps friend th directionally challenged always wanted one complaint friend gps huge price tag made wait upgraded feature price dropping much could resist buying one testing neighborhood work accurate error street name sd map called company asked free latest map within day purchase window unfortunately still since release much later year cost h mail sd map delivery fast need full charge install new software use new map since car charger drive work minute battery still max yet update upgrade new map gps intuitive use program trouble figuring feature enter address started using box low volume major complaint gps radio still hear one clearly max setting love street name turn announcement need even look screen also bell alert immediately turn bright blue screen easy see bright daylight one person complained bright night reviewer may know brightness setting tried problem tried free month traffic subscription yet miami commute nothing compare major city hesitant model low review saw since early price plus positive review willing risk think company may resolved issue upgrade day free map upgrade better customer service like said post experience upgrade new map see company actually fix issue reported customer service got excellent happy price feature unit far purcahsing wall charger unit already usb data link upgrade live city major change freeway highway road last year save money upgrade map simply wait later model current map gps seem getting cheaper month update jul got wall charger last week downloaded software update use new sd map sd map came quickly faxed magellan receipt date purchase wait wall charger need fully charge unit first problem download took minute problem inserted new sd map fault remove plastic screen protector cause error took min figure responding touch reset removed screen protector reset responded well touch far problem unit believe fixed software problem others complained name error one street still corrected new map save money live area major change road last year like poster asked really update map price feature absolutely happy unit none friend ever complained durability gps think unit replaced future better unit new map current expensive buying new unit,"06 26, 2010",A2IEX6RTEHI5DC,thia,{'Product Packaging:': ' Standard Packaging'},"Updated w/ new maps (had it for a week, no regrets so far)",1277510400,False,,1

1662,7904,674562,674562,B01FJFNE5I,,5.0,"In recent years, I've become a big fan of Lenovo.  After having some issues with purchases of an HP, 2 Acers,and a Dell over the past 4 years, I decided to give Lenovo a chance.  The first Lenovo purchase was for two 'Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p 59388313 15.6-Inch Laptop (Dusk Black) ' laptops.  While I found them a bit more expensive than other available laptops of similar specs, I was fed up with the poor performance and/or qualty of prior brands.

It's been about 2.5 years since the purchase of the Y510p laptops.  However, my wife was still using one of the last remaining Acers (a V5 Touch) as of this purchase a little over a month ago.  She could no longer stand to use it.  It had been replaced via Squaretrade maybe 6-8 months earlier and now it too was freezing and just barely responsive at time.  So I jumped on Amazon to find her a new laptop when I stumbled across this one one sale.  It's only been a short time, but this Lenovo has performed admirably.  It is super responsive and fairly lightweight when compared to other laptops, including the the Acer V5 touch.

It provides a strong specs showing at the price point.  It was retailing on Amazon for around $600 or so, but had a sale price of around $515.  However, I think that was PrimeDay and I got it for $400.  Great deal considering the specs:

Intel i5-6200U 2.3GH
8GB RAM
1TB Harddrive
Optical DVD RW drive
HD LED 15.6"" display
High-speed 802.11 a/c
USB 3.0 port
HDMI out
Windows 10

I've played around with it while my wife was away and it is impressive.  I wish I would have picked up a second one, at that price.  So we know have 3 Lenovo laptops and they have operated perfectly.  Even the 2.5 year old Y510p still perform as they did when new (one of which is heavily used for business, streaming, and software development and testing via virtual machines).  The latest addition won't have as rough a life, but I trust that we can depend on it for the long run.",recent year become big fan lenovo issue purchase hp acer dell past year decided give lenovo chance first lenovo purchase two lenovo ideapad p inch laptop dusk black laptop found bit expensive available laptop similar spec fed poor performance qualty prior brand year since purchase p laptop however wife still using one last remaining acer v touch purchase little month ago could longer stand use replaced via squaretrade maybe month earlier freezing barely responsive time jumped amazon find new laptop stumbled across one one sale short time lenovo performed admirably super responsive fairly lightweight compared laptop including acer v touch provides strong spec showing price point retailing amazon around sale price around however think primeday got great deal considering spec intel u gh gb ram tb harddrive optical dvd rw drive hd led display high speed c usb port hdmi window played around wife away impressive wish would picked second one price know lenovo laptop operated perfectly even year old p still perform new one heavily used business streaming software development testing via virtual machine latest addition rough life trust depend long run,"08 23, 2016",A281YNUJLGXDXO,J Ponder,{'Style:': ' Laptop Only'},Haven't gone wrong with Lenovo!,1471910400,True,3.0,1

I use a Canon T3i camera and I do a lot of shooting but not every day.  I've taken about 4000 pictures in the last 10 months and I'm a member at Shutterfly.

I was able to get this working as I wanted it to after about 10 minutes of setup.  I'm not big on directions, and I didn't really need them.  I did look up the Relay Transfer function in the help though.

Stuff I like about this product
- Easy setup
- No need for cables to transfer pictures
- My wife can now upload pictures to shutterfly without me telling her she's doing it wrong :)
- My pictures are organized automatically by shooting date without the need for the clunky canon software to do it.

Stuff I don't like about this product
- Most settings have to be changed from the PC, with the card connected.  I can't make changes to it from my camera's screen.
- SD card dongle is rather large, would be better to use a corded USB design or ship with a USB cord to attach to it.

Overall, excellent product.  I like knowing that I can back up pictures from virtually anywhere, any time.  An example of how this is great, picture yourself on a honeymoon.  You've taken 400-1000 pictures in a couple of days. Your eye-fi card is relaying these pictures to your home computer every chance it can.  Your camera gets stolen/lost/dropped in water/falls into volcano/falls out of hot air balloon/etc.  It is unfortunate that you have to get a new camera, but you didn't lose many (if any) pictures.  If you have a smart phone that can act as a wifi hotspot you can literally shoot pictures and upload them live.

*SkipDr. has a machine for Wii games however, I have used this same machine for our Wii disc.

Bad review issues- Stopping and Slowing down-
**Stopping
There may not be enough mist applied. The spray mist provided provides lubrication between the wheel and disc.
Check the repair wheel, the blue fan looking part. After exhausting all other conceivable issues, I took the repair wheel after and re-installed it. It worked perfectly. If the wheel isn't secure in place or if it has defects such as being slightly warped, it will stop to prevent disc damage.
**Slowing
Again, check the amount of fluid applied.
Remove disc and put it back in. 9 out of 10 times the disc was pushed all the down. Wanting to be gentle with the disc, I was not applying enough pressure when pushing down.
Sometimes I would just nudge the disc slightly and it would start moving on it's own.

My SkipDr came with an adapter. Knowing now how well it works, I would have no problem purchasing a power cord. Look at watts/volts/amps, you may already have one you can borrow from another appliance.
I would not recommend batteries. No more than a person would use it, I see that as a waste of money.

I was a little leary in purchasing another Lacie device, but their customer support is very good and I know their products are usually very good.

This newer model is substantially improved.  First, it no longer has a fan to cool it (which I think was unnecessary before anyway).  The inside only consists of a hard drive and a small circuit board.  It is completely sealed and just uses the outside aluminum case for cooler (which hardly gets warm).  This model also runs much quieter than the previous one.  The software that it runs (linux based) is much more improved as well.  The web interface is easier to use and you can also control more things, like turning off the blue light on the front and letting it go into sleep mode at specified times to save money.

Also, I am able to stream photos and listen to music from my DirecTV box with this.  The previous model had this same capability, but never worked right and would constantly hang.  This one works flawlessly and is easy to setup. I really like this, as you can show guests pictures right on your TV. It comes in handy.

I highly recommend this device.  It also has a 2nd partition that you can use to connect a computer directl to it for USB storage drive.

2916,7597,5866,5866,B00005NHAK,,5.0,"This camera is awesome, what makes it even more spectacular is the price. I could not be happier with it. First, it has great zoom capabilities. Second it is 3.3 megapixels for under $.... What more could you ask for?! Well, you may not be able to ask for a lot more, but you sure get it.
Before I bought this camera I did a lot of research. I even visited some of the local camera shops and electronics stores to get a feel for the different cameras before I ordered one on the net. Boy, it sure paid off.  There were some that had a body made of plastic. I don't intend to spend $... on something that is made of plastic. Others were very small and were uncomfortable to hold. The Minolta is the perfect size and weight.
When I hooked it up to my system for the first time, I was able to upload pictures in minutes.  Another nice feature is that you can take up to 60 Seconds worth of video, very nice. The video even loads up to the system easily.
In addition it uses a Compactflash card. These are pretty reasonably priced. A 16 MB card came with the camera. Most of the pictures I have taken so far are about 500K, so you can store quite a few pictures. I also purchased a 128 MB card at a good price here on ..., so I have plenty of space to store pictures before committing them to CD via my system.
I only have one warning. You need to buy Ni-MH batteries. Then charge them for at least 24 hours, the first time. If you don't the camera will keep coming back and telling you that your batteries are dead. When I called support they kept telling me that I had to buy a special brand of batteries. This wasn't the case, you just need to fully charge the batteries.

All the mounting hardware is included (as is a 10 foot HDMI cable and a bubble level).  This is the second TV I have wall mounted, the first being over ten years ago when the process was a lot more difficult and when TV's were a lot heavier.  This was a much easier mounting process that required only minimal mechanical skill and tools, although I would still suggest having a partner.
This is also a VESA mount.  VESA is an organization that provides uniformity standards for the different brands of consumer electronics to comply with, which as far as mounts go, means that most major TV brands will have similar mounting set-ups so the process and equipment used for mounting will be standard, or 'VESA compliant'.

This sub arrived as scheduled. Initially, I was very excited to hook this sub up. The sub is only 150 RMS and 300 watt max but since it is a Kicker product, my expectations were high. I read tons of reviews saying how this is ""the best subwoofer for the price.. period"" and ""Kicks so  hard for the wattage"". Well, maybe.

I'm currently running an 800 watt Visonik Bridgable amp. I will tell you this, this kicker can hit hard, but cannot preform good low bass notes and deep bass. Its really not loud at all. I purchased it thinking it would atleast shake my small car a little (i have a 1993 Chrysler Lebaron) and it hardly does anything. Now i'm not expecting these to be Kicker l7 material or bust my windows out... But Its dissapointing for a kicker product.

I'm asking that you take my word for it because a few reasons. I'm not an amateur nooby car audio kid. I've had a few speakers in my day and i know how to set systems up pretty well. I'm just saying right now, PLEASE LISTEN. If you are looking for your first subwoofer for a small car, then go ahead and by one. Hell maybe two. But if you were like me looking for the short way out of some cheap 12 inch kickers to rattle your car, save yourself the money and purchase a better model or different brand.

1.  My intention was to use this on the TV in my basement so I wouldn't have to have it on my main TV, adding yet another box on my entertainment center.  The plan was to use it to record, and then carry the recording on the thumb drive to my Western Digital Media player to watch.  As it turns out, the DVR records in ""blocks"" of 511 megabytes, so recording the 24 series opener gave me 25 files.  Only the first file was named with a "".mts"" extension.  That one plays fine.  All the rest of the files are named "".mts1"" "".mts2"" "".mts3"" and so on.  So, to play each of the files on any source other than the DVR, I had to rename all the files to "".mts"".

2.  File naming.  The recorded files only show the station ID and time stamp.  It makes no sense to me that if there is an electronic program guide and the ability to rename files manually (both of which work great by the way), why the unit can't name the recording using the name of the show.

3.  Clunky remote.  I'm never lost because the on-screen prompts that show what you can do, but seriously, why would I press ""hold"" to go full screen?  how about a button that says ""full screen"" or something intuitive.  I bought this as a test for my Mother in Law, and she will eventually pick up on the visual cues, but it needs to be made more user friendly.

All in all, a good buy.  I'll probably be buying another one shortly.

Update 5-13:

I gave it another go with a faster USB hard drive, and this time, the entire program recorded in one file.  It would be nice to know why.  I can only speculate as to why.  I hope the manufacturer is reading this.  Anyway, MAKE SURE you have a fast flash drive.  My original USB drive gave hiccups every few seconds.  Now it works fine.

Update 1/21/16:

unit has been having issues for a while now.  About two months ago, the coax input quit working, so I had to eat up an HDMI port to support it.  It quit turning on with the remote, although turning off and all other functions were fine.  It has frozen up a couple of times in the last week or so, and finally just shut off with no sign of life.

I still recommend this device.  I bought it on May 3, 2014 for 59.99.  That is still less than one month of service with any cable provider and has provided me nearly two years of good service.  I just ordered another one to replace it, and now they're 32.99.

I have two quibbles with this switch, the bright blue status LED and the external IR receiver.  I don't know why so many manufacturers put the blue status lights on devices for home theater equipment because even a single status light can easily light up a room.  The other problem was the external IR receiver.  The receiver has a short cord, which does not help when you are trying to hide that bright blue status light.  The IR receiver also had a very limited field from which it could pick up a signal.  I had to point directly at the receiver and even then it was flaky.

However video in low light was much darker than other cameras that i used, and especially in high fps modes it would get WAY darker and very grainy. I compared to my old casio before and my samsung wb2000 which both did high fps video and the difference was very apparent, it was darker and way noisier. You pretty much can only use this effectively outside. Normal 1080p video was decent enough quality when there's enough light, i had wind noise reduction on and it didn't seem to do anything though.

Picture quality seems decent enough for a point and shoot, the precapture and high fps shooting modes are easy and great to use, preset modes are mostly useful too and easy to use and understand. Zoom works great, even the combined physical and digital zoom was done well.

Overall if casio would have given better low light sensitivity i would have loved it but it really was crippled by this.

1981,6797,267751,267751,B0067XX3AI,,2.0,"Who needs a tablet computer?  That is what I've been saying to my Apple Fanboy friends since the iPad came out.  Honestly, if it weren't for the Vine program, I would not have gotten a tablet.

My first impression, out of the box is, I'm impressed.  It seems to act just like my Android phone.  It is very responsive for a 1GHz cpu.

The instructions that come with it are non-existent, a card with where the buttons are.  Their support page gives a URL error.  Their FAQs has no entries except for the specs.

Cons:
* The sound is very tinny.  It is not very good, especially compared to my friend's iPad.
*  No rear facing camera.  So this is only good for chat.  Can't really take pictures or use a scanner app.  A little disappointing.
* The auto-brightness doesn't work very well for me.  I think it makes the display too dark under all lighting conditions.
* It cannot play trailers from apple.com/trailers.
* The system tutorial in Settings->About Tablet doesn't work.  It just returns to the previous screen.
* Android 2.2 is not designed for tablets.  Google said this.
* The wireless can use 802.11n but only the 2.4GHz band and not the less cluttered 5GHz band.
* My biggest complaint is that both the on/off and the volume buttons are very hard to use.  They are too small or too recessed.

Pros:
* The display is very nice and a good size.
* Price, though I think they could have sprung for more than a 4gb card.  Even my phone came with 8bg card.
* Battery life seems real good.  I've been using it for over 3 hours over two days and it is at 56%.
* The Android system is a plus.  I hope it can be upgraded to 3.0+
*  It comes with the Kindle app installed and ebooks look real nice.  I do still like my Kindle better since it is so much lighter.
* Touch screen is very sensitive.  I find if I press too hard, it doesn't work. But of course that kind of sensitivity can be bad too, because I press things I don't mean to all the time.

Some other notes:  I tried Firefox mobile on it.  It doesn't feel like Firefox and the password manager doesn't allow for a master password and that made me nervous.  Also flash did not work with Firefox, so I removed it.  I do not like the generic Browser on Android.  So I will be looking for a new one.

I installed the ""Hackers Keyboard"" from the app store and really like that.  No more hunting around for special keys, they are all there.

I played some games that required interaction of the touch screen and the motion detections system.  Both worked very well.

You might think from all my cons that I don't like this tablet, but that is incorrect.  Most of the cons are nits.  If you are looking for a device that you can sit on the couch with, browse the web and check email, this is it.  It would be nice if the speakers sounded better (I'm looking for an equalizer app) and if the buttons were easier to use, but this is a very nice device for $350.

Update 5-30-11
As of today, I would NOT buy this tablet.  It does somethings nice, but many things including Netflix don't work and Le Pan has not plans to upgrade this to Andriod 2.3 let alone 3.0 or above.  They make a nice tablet and plan to release another 9.7 with 3.0, so I would wait.

Update 7-24-12
Now that I can, I've changed the rating to 2 star.  It was an okay tablet while it worked with the flaws mentioned above.  But as I suspected, they never updated the software.
Also, the Wi-Fi died.

2360,7927,603048,603048,B011WSX82A,,5.0,"This is a very good radar detector with some nice features you just won't find many, if any, other places.

Range: The range on this unit can be very good, especially on Ka Band. It will meet or exceed the range of many high end detectors and have excellent off-axis sensitivity to pick up radar signals that may not be directly in front of you. One note, K band range has tested good but not excellent. It has been sufficient in my area but is not on the same level as the Ka range. If K is not a big concern in your area, not issues. If K is your primary threat, you may want to consider its bigger brother the SE or another unit all together. For me it is a non issue and leads to less false alerts.

Filtering: Multiple options for filtering. Speed based muting keeps everything under a certain speed limit very quiet. One alert and then it mutes. Additional speed based city and auto city modes will lower sensitivity to X, K, and Ka bands based on your preference at a pre set speed (such as your typically speed limit in your area). Another level under that mutes everything completely. Good for parking lots and such (think 15 mph and lower). In addition it has two levels of TSR filtering. Most radar detectors only have one. Low adds a short delay to K band alerts to be sure that it is not a traffic filter or blind spot monitor system found on some newer cars. High makes the delay longer to accomplish the same thing. Use whichever works for you. The lower the better as the shorter delay allows the detector to respond more quickly.

GPS: This detector also has GPS lockout features built in. I don't personally use them as the GPS speed sensitive alerts referenced above are sufficient for me and I don't have to worry about accidentally locking out a real threat. Radenso is working on a firmware update to change the way lockouts are handled. In addition to lockouts, this detector offers Speed Camera, Redlight Camera, and Speed Trap Camera GPS alerts and the database is free (included with cost of detector). This is very important if these can be found in your area.

Additional PROS: The size. This this is tiny. Should be able to find a place for this thing in any vehicle. Other detectors that don't have GPS are much larger. The mount works very well. They are constantly improving this unit through downloadable firmware updates as well as the Speedcam, Redlightcam, and Speed Trap Database. They say they are enthusiast driven and are working hard on continuous improvement. That is a plus.

CONS: If I had to point out a few things that could be better. I sometimes have trouble viewing the screen wearing Polarized Sunglasses. This can be mitigated some by changing the angle or moving the location on the windshield. The power connector is a type typically seen on cheaper detectors, could have used a style similar to Escort, Beltronics, and Uniden. The case does not feel as substantial as the price tag might indicate.

Reception was okay, but after trying 2 or 3 different positions (lower height in the window, a bit more to the middle of the window etc.) reception is now maximized. The roku tv I use displays the signal strength for each of the channels it displays,

For most channels, this antenna picked up pure signals and had a good picture quality. I had to place the antenna at the top of a nearby window. When I moved it inside, picture quality was definitely affected. With that said, this is a UHF antenna only. From what I understand UHF is the standard for the most part, however here in Austin, the fox over the air channel is broadcast in VHF. As a result, I have to return this antenna. If there are no channels where you live broadcasting in VHF only, and you can place your antenna in a window, this should work fine. Honestly, if the local fox chanel was not broadcasting in an ancient freqency, I would be keeping this and incredibly happy",first wrote review however using antenna tv side wall receiving vhf uhf reception okay trying different position lower height window bit middle window etc reception maximized roku tv use display signal strength channel display channel antenna picked pure signal good picture quality place antenna top nearby window moved inside picture quality definitely affected said uhf antenna understand uhf standard part however austin fox air channel broadcast vhf result return antenna channel live broadcasting vhf place antenna window work fine honestly local fox chanel broadcasting ancient freqency would keeping incredibly happy,"10 30, 2016",A7V2YDDQZ1O46,Patriots fan,,"Good antenna, play with placement until you get it just right.",1477785600,True,,1

It's a bit confusing to switch from mono to stereo, presets, that kind of stuff but you get the hang of it. Sound quality is good, not flawless it does cut out sometimes.

My two biggest problems with this transmitter, and reasons why I had to change my review. One, the transmitter goes from 88.1 to 107.x... I live in Wisconsin, we don't have a whole lot of stations compared to some places, so I can't imagine this thing would work as well for people in say, Chicago, or Milwaukee, or some place more urban than where I am.

Second, and a little more worrying, where the thing plugged into my ipod, the rubber coating came loose from the plug making some of the wires exposed. This I did not like, I tossed it the day I noticed it because the last thing I wanted was a potential fire hazard. And for anybody that thing I stretched the cord too far or something like that. No. Most of the time I had it in a little spot about a foot infront of the plug (think 04+ Pontiac Grand Prix, little spot infront of shifter, with it plugged in right behind shifter). So there's no way I was stretched the cord, bending the cord or anything like it shouldn't have been.

The keyboard layout works out nicely for my fingers and the tactile touch is nice.
Here's a few observations I've found comparing it to the Logitech
1.) PROTECTS. I love having a protective case around my iPad. I've already dropped it once without damage. The Logitech does not protect the iPad
2.) Auto Sleep-Mode. The Kensington shuts off automatically after a few minutes of inactivity, saving battery life. The Logitech stayed on unless your powered it off
3.) STABILITY. The Kensington has a weird stability. It sits stable when on a flat surface, but when i try to use it in my favorite spot (the recliner), it's tough to make the prop angle stable. On your lap, the screen wants to lean forward or backward. The LogiTech was very stable because of the way it sat in the groove.
4.) COPY/PASTE The Kensington doesn't have a Copy/Cut/Paste function key (or I haven't found it yet). This was a very useful feature on the LogiTech keyboard.
Overall, I'm very pleased with my Kensington.

2659,1867,531328,531328,B00PPXMM5S,,4.0,"There are so, so many of these dash cams out there, and they're becoming more popular in the US, so I figured I should get ahead of the game and try one out in my car.

The device comes well-boxed with a car charger (cigarette lighter with a long, long cable (about 4 feet) to micro USB), a regular micro USB cable for your computer, a suction cup, and that's about it. It's a very through-the-motions packaging experience. Nothing fancy, and the camera itself is a little plastic-y. The buttons on the camera have a very satisfying click to them, and my sample's regular LCD screen looked just fine (if not HD), with no stuck/dead pixels or other screen anomalies.

Setup was a little trickier than I'd have liked, - it's not a touch screen, and the button layout is not instinctively intuitive. Once you have it set up (date/time etc), it all becomes a lot simpler as you'll likely just be hitting the record button.

Getting a micro SD card into the unit took a bit of finagling. I ended up using a credit card to push it in all the way as I don't really have any nails to speak of. In a positive sense, at least it won't be popping out by mistake!

Image quality is actually quite decent. There's a slight fish-bowl look to things, a result of the extremely wide lens in there to capture everything very close in front of you (in the event of a collision, for example). Cars come out pretty well defined, and you'd have no trouble reading license plates when the car in front is reasonably close to you. This is important, so I'm glad it works.

Curiously, while you can zoom in and out, you cannot do this while the camera is recording. However, to be fair, it's just a digital zoom (there's no physical lens movement that I can tell), so you don't gain any extra detail by zooming in anyway. If you have some basic editing tools at home, you can always zoom in as necessary, after the fact.

The GSHOCK option in the camera menu I found quite interesting. You can set it to low, medium, or high sensitivity, and the camera will record if it detects any sudden shock to the device. This could be particularly handy if someone crashes into you when you're parked, although if they ram the back of your car, you might well be wishing you had another camera in the back window! At the highest sensitivity (my recommendation), it did a pretty decent job when I tapped the camera mount itself - starting recording immediately, though I'll wait till someone reverses into my car to test that feature out extensively!

There are a few software quirks (e.g. to turn the device off you have to hold down the power button for a second or two... and then let go. If you don't let go, it never actually turns off! Weird), and the interface definitely takes a little getting used to, but, you know.., the Esky 2.4"" Full HD car camera does a pretty decent job - doing basically what it sets out to do, and it works.

Overall, 4 out of 5. Certainly recommended for those in need of a dash-cam fix!

1293,452,128487,128487,B003ZX8B3W,,3.0,"The unit overall works well and is suitably reviewed.  The purpose of this review is to warn you about Junction View. Note this is different from Lane Assist, which does work.

Junction View is shown prominently in Garmin advertisements for many GPSr's. It is deceptive advertising; it only works in a few, rare areas and Garmin won't tell you what those areas are.
Garmin on Junction View
<...>

Both searching the Garmin website and googling, it appears Garmin keeps Junction View locations a secret.  Calling and asking techs will get you varying answers as to how many areas it works in.

You can post Q&A on Garmin's and other forums and hope someone will confirm what areas work for you.  Once guy said it did work for parts of New York City....great.  I can confirm it does not work in Richmond, VA.

But then again I could be wrong about Richmond.  It appears Garmin's map updates can delete junction view.  JV has to be re-installed manually by downloading a file and mounting the GPS as a drive (i.e. the installer program uninstalls junction view, but doesn't install it back on).  Garmin does not provide this information on their Junction View page, you have to search the help files on the correct keywords you'll find that out.
<...>

The Amazon sales page should have a caveat in big letters highlighting that:
- Junction view, while given it's own prominent paragraph and picture in the advertisement, works only in a few small, select areas.
- Garmin keeps those areas a secret
- If it does work for you, updating your maps can delete junction view
Thus if junction view works in your area, you are lucky (and don't update your maps if you want to keep them)

If junction view does not work in your area, you need to:
- search the Garmin help files, find the write junction view file for your unit,
- follow directions to save them on your desktop.
- You will NOT use the map installer program to install the map files,
- Instead follow the directions to mount the GPS as a drive and manually insert files into correct location for your unit
- Note that the above just puts the files on your GPSr, junction view may not display in your area.

If junction view still doesn't work for you, it's either because
- you installed them wrong, or
- they don't work in your area

The driver installation is quick and helpful since it gives you programs that optimize games, overclocks the GPU, and compares all other devices to get the best possible output. When it comes to regular tasks like writing documents and other non-gaming things, the GPU can handle a small amount since it is primarily used for gaming.

I have a separate unit set up to record dvd's of my favorite TV shows, pay per view movies, etc. I still prefer this to using TiVo or hard drive recording.  When my ""recording unit"" ages out (it's a Panasonic recorder) I will replace it with the new Tobisha combo. I bought the Tobisha because I still need the capability to play videotapes and it does that very nicely on my widescreen plasma TV. The picture quality for both videotapes and dvd's is excellent -- not as good as blu ray, but a cut above normal playback that I had before.

After several days, I feel confident that I can give an accurate assessment of the product. The product is labelled as being made from leather. It does have thick and strong texture like the full grain leather but the backing of the leather leaves me wondering whether it is imitation or synthetic. Leather also has a distinctive leather smell (from the tanning process) and this one is more chemical like. The inside of the cover is lined with synthetic suede. The cover core seems to be made from cardboard and so it is quite stiff. Some people may not mind it but I find I could not fold the front cover to the back of the Nook like I normally do with paperback book covers. The cardboard core stiffness did not give me confidence that it was a high quality product.

The way the color Nook is placed in this product is to slide it in from the top. It does have the appropriate openings for the volume controls, the off switch and the jack for the microUSB. The challenge for me was the zipper part sort of blocks the clean entry of the microUSB plug into the Nook and also pushing the microUSB into the Nook would make the Nook slide out this ""leather"" cover. Since it was so easy to slide the Nook in and out, I thought that this could present the danger if I had the cover unzipped and I had it upside down that the Nook could fall out the cover and into the ground (HORROR!!). So I am making the habit to at least zip the top part of this cover so it will not happen.

It is my opinion that the price I paid for is a little high for this product. It is stylish and protective for the Nook and OK for utility. The stand is only for horizontal landscape mode and if I was reading email, I would have to turn the Nook in vertical mode and this cover does not seem to have the facility and so I have to hold it in my hands.

ADDENDUM:

I had this cover on my Nook for a while and it is when I am reading the Nook that I notice strongly that I cannot set the Nook on its stand to read a book because of the horizontal stand. Nook Books are only for the vertical direction. So I have to hold it in my hand all the time or lay it flat on the table.

ADDENDUM 2:

There was a second Nook at home and despite the shortcomings of its inability for this cover to stand vertically, the positives outweighed the negative and so I purchased a SECOND ONE. And I realized why one commenter mentioned the velcro thing for this cover. The second one had a small case within the cover that was attached with Velcro. This model was more stable than the one I have as it did have Velcro on top to keep the Nook from sliding out. I purchased this from pcmicro store on a well known auction site as it was being charged for less than here and this same seller is selling here too.",wanted try product several day left review several day feel confident give accurate assessment product product labelled made leather thick strong texture like full grain leather backing leather leaf wondering whether imitation synthetic leather also distinctive leather smell tanning process one chemical like inside cover lined synthetic suede cover core seems made cardboard quite stiff people may mind find could fold front cover back nook like normally paperback book cover cardboard core stiffness give confidence high quality product way color nook placed product slide top appropriate opening volume control switch jack microusb challenge zipper part sort block clean entry microusb plug nook also pushing microusb nook would make nook slide leather cover since easy slide nook thought could present danger cover unzipped upside nook could fall cover ground horror making habit least zip top part cover happen opinion price paid little high product stylish protective nook ok utility stand horizontal landscape mode reading email would turn nook vertical mode cover seem facility hold hand addendum cover nook reading nook notice strongly cannot set nook stand read book horizontal stand nook book vertical direction hold hand time lay flat table addendum second nook home despite shortcoming inability cover stand vertically positive outweighed negative purchased second one realized one commenter mentioned velcro thing cover second one small case within cover attached velcro model stable one velcro top keep nook sliding purchased pcmicro store well known auction site charged le seller selling,"05 9, 2011",A28AOYX0UWTI66,psat,,Decent and stylish protection for the Nook Color,1304899200,True,38,0

First off, if you expecting an OEM battery you can spend 6x what this one costs to get those standards. I call these my back up batteries that I use first while on a shoot or out in the field.

I have 2 Canon OEM batteries which can be recharged for years, have no problem communicating, and are my reliable sources of power. Along with those 2 OEM Batteries I have 4 of these inexpensive batteries that do the job when my shooting is a little more flexible. They probably hold about 80% of the charge an OEM battery has and after a 12-18 months I expect my camera may stops communicating all together or it will no longer hold a charge. That's the nature of the game.

However, if you go into this purchase knowing that then you shouldn't be surprised if one dies on you. When you're out in the field and you need power I recommend using your OEM battery last and using these batteries first. They will more than likely give you all the charge you need for your shoot however you have the added insurance of an OEM workhorse sitting in your bag ready to go if you run out of juice. With one exception, don't rely on these batteries during a ""no second chance shoot"". Meaning I wouldn't have these batteries in my camera during the wedding ceremony or the start of a race, however if you are doing staged shots or won't be affected when the battery runs out of juice and you have to switch batteries then you will be fine.

Again for the price they are offering these at you can have 5-6x the power in your bag, however they do not replace the reliability of an OEM battery, so don't assume they do.",one get pay type product first expecting oem battery spend x one cost get standard call back battery use first shoot field canon oem battery recharged year problem communicating reliable source power along oem battery inexpensive battery job shooting little flexible probably hold charge oem battery month expect camera may stop communicating together longer hold charge nature game however go purchase knowing surprised one dy field need power recommend using oem battery last using battery first likely give charge need shoot however added insurance oem workhorse sitting bag ready go run juice one exception rely battery second chance shoot meaning battery camera wedding ceremony start race however staged shot affected battery run juice switch battery fine price offering x power bag however replace reliability oem battery assume,"01 7, 2016",A2IW2X9GYZHRTZ,NeedProductReviews,,Inexpensive Option to OEM with some flaws,1452124800,True,2.0,1

The wired Ethernet port on this laptop is a joke - instead of just a normal tried and true RJ45 port, some first year design student at Lenovo decided to ""improve it"" by removing the STANDARD Ethernet port and adding some collapsing draw-bridge type monstrosity that twice now has required me cutting the patch cable out of the port in order not to break the laptop.

See the attached picture to see what I mean.  The bottom part opens down to allow the RJ45 Plug to enter and latch, where it will remain for all eternity until you either break the flip down door completely off, or use a pair of electricians pliers to crush the RJ45 plug allowing the pieces to fall out.  This is the worse design on a laptop I've seen in years.

I finally ordered a USB3-Ethernet adapter (and took the speed hit) so that I could plug in and remove the patch cord like normal people.

411,8916,37759,37759,B000A6LSVY,,5.0,"Let me preface this review by stating that I've been a fan of Microsoft hardware (primarily mice & keyboards) for some time now.  I'm not die-hard a MS fan by any means (heck I prefer Unix over Windows for most uses), but I have to admit they've done a decent job at making computer hardware.  I especially like their ergonomic keyboards and optical mice.  I know many people prefer Logitech's products, but I'm not a gamer, so Microsoft's input devices suit me just fine.

I thought I bought the holy grail of mice when I upgraded to the Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 about a year ago, so much so that I got the notebook version for my laptop not long after.  So I was skeptical about the level of improvement on these new-fangled laser mice, and hadn't planned on buying one.

However, I never really cared for the snap-in receiver on my Wireless Notebook Mouse 3000.  It is designed to be adjustable so that the end of the receiver can be repositioned to different angles for the best wireless reception.  Unfortunately, this design also makes the receiver come loose easily when stored in the bottom of the mouse, causing it to turn on frequently while not in use--draining battery life.  So I decided to give the MS Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000 a try, as it comes with a fixed receiver that doesn't move.

I was blown away by how much better the laser notebook mouse tracks.  It is surprisingly more precise and accurate than the previous mouse devices.  It's hard to understand the improvement until you've tried one.  The mouse is extremely responsive, and makes other non-laser mice feel like heavy paperweights in comparison.  The laser is not just a gimmicky marketing trick, it really makes for a better mouse!  I subsequently bought the Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 for my desktop, and am experiencing the same level of improvement there as well.  It feels terrific in my hand, and I like the fact that it can also run on one AA battery (like other MS wireless mice I've used) for a reduced weight.

The only drawback is that the laser is invisible, as I miss the red light on the bottom of my old mouse sometimes (but not enough to go back to the old mouse!).  Also, I would rather have a black receiver than the more standout silver color.  I experimented and found that the laser mouse will work with the black wireless receiver for the Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0, but scrolling doesn't work as well, so I'm sticking with the silver receiver.

Congrats on improving a nice product, Microsoft!",let preface review stating fan microsoft hardware primarily mouse keyboard time die hard m fan mean heck prefer unix window us admit done decent job making computer hardware especially like ergonomic keyboard optical mouse know many people prefer logitech product gamer microsoft input device suit fine thought bought holy grail mouse upgraded wireless intellimouse explorer year ago much got notebook version laptop long skeptical level improvement new fangled laser mouse planned buying one however never really cared snap receiver wireless notebook mouse designed adjustable end receiver repositioned different angle best wireless reception unfortunately design also make receiver come loose easily stored bottom mouse causing turn frequently use draining battery life decided give m wireless notebook laser mouse try come fixed receiver move blown away much better laser notebook mouse track surprisingly precise accurate previous mouse device hard understand improvement tried one mouse extremely responsive make non laser mouse feel like heavy paperweight comparison laser gimmicky marketing trick really make better mouse subsequently bought wireless laser mouse desktop experiencing level improvement well feel terrific hand like fact also run one aa battery like m wireless mouse used reduced weight drawback laser invisible miss red light bottom old mouse sometimes enough go back old mouse also would rather black receiver standout silver color experimented found laser mouse work black wireless receiver wireless intellimouse explorer scrolling work well sticking silver receiver congrats improving nice product microsoft,"03 7, 2006",A3SKZXSJDKD18S,ilovetofu,,Love this mouse!,1141689600,False,,1

I own Macbook Pros which I use consistently as well as Windows laptops. When I saw this for the price that I mentioned above I could not resist it! In a nutshell I can truly say that I really like this little Hisense Chromebook. To me it works as fast as my Macbook Pro and maybe a little bit faster! Heck I now use this Chromebook more than I use my Macbook Pro! This thing boots up quickly and you can get right to surfing the internet as soon as possible without a delay.

This little Chromebook is nothing like the Windows netbooks which were the exact same size that I bought just a couple of years ago who would eventually get slow and laggy. This is a browser laptop that works!....and gets the job done for what your trying to do. If it's just surfing the internet or watching videos on Youtube it does what its suppose do and does it right. I didn't think I would like these little Chromebooks, but I can honestly admit I was totally wrong.

This would be the perfect present for someone who cannot afford to buy a computer to use for surfing the internet, or for someone who may own an older laptop/desktop that has began to run at a snails pace but they just don't have the money to buy a new one in this tough economy. Or it can be for someone who may not be so tech savvy such as some Spouses, Grandparents, Parents, in-laws, or that not too tech savvy Uncle, Aunt or cousin who wants to just get the internet for basic purposes.

**UPDATE** 8-2-2016

I had given the Hisense Chromebook to someone who needed a computer. I missed my Hisense Chromebook so much to the point that I just ordered another one, it only cost $84.00, and I just received it a couple of days ago...Let me tell you I am so Happy to have my Hisense Chromebook back with me.  I also wanted to mention that after I bought the first Hisense Chromebook I managed to purchase two more Chromebooks refurbished (Groupon) which is the Acer CB5-571-c4g4 and the Acer CB3-571-c4a5 and that shows how much i've grown to really like Chromebooks. They are both 15.6"" and the perfect size but just like I said I had to repurchase my beloved Hisense Chromebook that I like to use when i'm laying in bed when I don't feel like using my tablets and other laptops. The Hisense Chromebook is truly an EXCELLENT bang for your buck and I never thought that I would say that before I bought the first Hisense Chromebook, and I truly mean that!...Try a Hisense Chromebook for yourself and you will see exactly what I mean.

1108,7267,513010,513010,B00NJ4ARW0,,5.0,"SO glad I found these.  I had been running with normal buds (the type that don't go in your ear canal) and was going crazy resetting them every 15 seconds ... definitely a serious distraction when you're doing hard cardio.  I got these at wally world for 19.99 and used them the same night I bought them.  INSTANT APPRECIATION.

The fidelity of the ear buds is good enough for me.  Listening to some re-mastered Led Zeppelin I definitely heard nuances to the music I've never heard before .. while running hard, about to die, sweating a gallon a minute pounding like a herd of elephants on a treadmill in a gym that pipes constant loud music.  Good enough for me.

The cover design really is the money here.  By using silicon, which has a natural tackiness to it compared to other ""rubber"" and by inserting into the canal their 'put it in and twist' technique REALLY DO keep them in... while running several miles and sweating like a pig, while doing situps, doing all sorts of weird yoga stretches, lifting ... you name it.  My set included two different sets of covers; I experimented with the larger ones but the smaller ones (that were installed as shipped) fit me like a glove.  You can remove and replace them very easily; when you replace them, make sure that you shift them slightly ""off 90 degrees""... left on between 3 and 4 oclock, right one between 8 and 9 oclock.

It takes about two time inserting and removing them to get used to the ""twist lock"" design - after that, they go in and out as quickly and easily as any other earbud. Just hold it upside and put the pointed end in your ear ... then twist down to normal position and they're locked in.

These allow ambient sound in - a plus for situational awareness for sure - but since they direct the music into the ear I found that even at moderate volumes I could hear my music over the gym's music (which is constant and pretty loud).  However, by dropping the volume slightly I could hear what's going on around me and was able to find the right mix of music vs ambient sound pretty easily.  At one point I found myself *directly under* a speaker - these are large speakers, probably 100 watts or more - and I had to turn up the volume some.  At home I was doing some stretches in a room directly connected to the kitchen while someone else was banging around pots and pans, slamming the fridge door - those made it through pretty clearly with the volume at about 50% ... at that point, to coexist with someone banging around pots and pans while Im trying to chill to some Ambient music and stretch I probably would have preferred noise isolating headphones.  But I'm honestly very happy with the mix of music to ambient that I get with these at the gym.

I think the single button is ingenious as well.  It hangs on the right hand cord before the two cords are joined up, so you can easily located it even if you have the rest of the cord wrapped up, routed through a jacket, etc.  At first I wasn't sure if I would like having a single button, but now I can't imagine ever needing more than one button.  This single button allows you to pause and resume music, move forward and back a track, answer and hang up calls, and EVEN activate voice commands on my Android phone (ie Ok Google).  I made a voice call with them while driving, and the other person said I was coming in loud and clear.  I just installed a new Bluetooth gadget for my car that also uses the single button approach - honestly it sounds confusing at first (like, where's the forward button ? where's  the volume button ? ) but it becomes very intuitive very quickly and is more minimal.

They also include magnets in them, so the two earbuds stick together. That's a great, thoughtful innovative feature.  It does help prevent them from tangling a bit, but I really like that I can clip them behind my head when I'm not listening to them.  Yep, they'll clip to a locker even.

The very first night I wore these to the gym they were SO comfortable, so easily forgotten that I had them in, so stable that I wore them through my entire lifting routine as well - other than the cord (which definitely gets in the way when you're lifting) the earbuds stay perfectly fit.  When stretching, if my phone ended up a little further away I could literally drag it over the floor closer to me just by dragging with my head- the buds still stayed in place.

The earbuds themselves are the type that sit outside the ear, like iPhone ear buds.  You can purchase the Yurbuds cover seperately to replace any that have worn (or to turn ""ordinary"" earbuds into Yurbuds) but they're pricey and may be able to just buy a whole new replacement headset.

They come with a little carrier bag which also has a carry loop in it, so I can clip them to my lock, although the carry loop is becoming frayed already.

Because I need long recovery periods I tend to only work out once or twice a week for several hours at a time. The Yurbuds stay firmly put and are very comfortable in my ears for hours at a time, no problem.

I would honestly have to say that these are the best earbuds/earphones I've owned.  Don't buy these to listen to fancy music. Earbuds aren't for critical listening -that's what good headphones or good monitors are for.  But if you want solid audio sound and - more importnatly - comfortable, well fitting earbuds that STAY IN PLACE than this is the one for you. I wasn't paid, didn't receive a free sample, not a gilded reviewer or anything and I don't go throwing out 5 stars all over the place ... I bought these with my own cash at a retail store and really do love them.

Full disclosure: Now that I'm already used to listening to music during my whole workout, I've purchased some bluetooth headphones as the cable can definitely become an annoyance when lifting, and sometimes I need to rest my phone away from my work area.  If those workout, these will Yurbuds be my turn-to for outdoor running, walking/hiking and around the house; anytime I want earbuds that stay put and the cable won't get in the way.  This isn't a downgrade on the Yurbuds, it's just that I do alot of different exercises and it's enough that just having a cable becomes a nuisance.",glad found running normal bud type go ear canal going crazy resetting every second definitely serious distraction hard cardio got wally world used night bought instant appreciation fidelity ear bud good enough listening mastered led zeppelin definitely heard nuance music never heard running hard die sweating gallon minute pounding like herd elephant treadmill gym pipe constant loud music good enough cover design really money using silicon natural tackiness compared rubber inserting canal put twist technique really keep running several mile sweating like pig situps sort weird yoga stretch lifting name set included two different set cover experimented larger one smaller one installed shipped fit like glove remove replace easily replace make sure shift slightly degree left oclock right one oclock take two time inserting removing get used twist lock design go quickly easily earbud hold upside put pointed end ear twist normal position locked allow ambient sound plus situational awareness sure since direct music ear found even moderate volume could hear music gym music constant pretty loud however dropping volume slightly could hear going around able find right mix music v ambient sound pretty easily one point found directly speaker large speaker probably watt turn volume home stretch room directly connected kitchen someone else banging around pot pan slamming fridge door made pretty clearly volume point coexist someone banging around pot pan im trying chill ambient music stretch probably would preferred noise isolating headphone honestly happy mix music ambient get gym think single button ingenious well hang right hand cord two cord joined easily located even rest cord wrapped routed jacket etc first sure would like single button imagine ever needing one button single button allows pause resume music move forward back track answer hang call even activate voice command android phone ie ok google made voice call driving person said coming loud clear installed new bluetooth gadget car also us single button approach honestly sound confusing first like forward button volume button becomes intuitive quickly minimal also include magnet two earbuds stick together great thoughtful innovative feature help prevent tangling bit really like clip behind head listening yep clip locker even first night wore gym comfortable easily forgotten stable wore entire lifting routine well cord definitely get way lifting earbuds stay perfectly fit stretching phone ended little away could literally drag floor closer dragging head bud still stayed place earbuds type sit outside ear like iphone ear bud purchase yurbuds cover seperately replace worn turn ordinary earbuds yurbuds pricey may able buy whole new replacement headset come little carrier bag also carry loop clip lock although carry loop becoming frayed already need long recovery period tend work twice week several hour time yurbuds stay firmly put comfortable ear hour time problem would honestly say best earbuds earphone owned buy listen fancy music earbuds critical listening good headphone good monitor want solid audio sound importnatly comfortable well fitting earbuds stay place one paid receive free sample gilded reviewer anything go throwing star place bought cash retail store really love full disclosure already used listening music whole workout purchased bluetooth headphone cable definitely become annoyance lifting sometimes need rest phone away work area workout yurbuds turn outdoor running walking hiking around house anytime want earbuds stay put cable get way downgrade yurbuds alot different exercise enough cable becomes nuisance,"01 1, 2015",A3F4OO6AEYUWNG,Mark Twain,{'Color:': ' Black'},"REALLY do stay put even when running, lifting, yoga, anything.",1420070400,False,6,1

Yes, it adds weight and bulk, but I rather have it to protect the tablet from accidental bumps, scratches and drops, especially when my 4 yr old kid is playing with it. The case fits nice and snug.

How to prevent it from turning itself off: Set your input device up hight close to or at max, set the Speaker to middle volume.

Therefore we wanted a basic, entry level 5.1 Receiver an pair it with DVD player that can be replaced at lower cost if it failed again. We originally settled for the Yamaha V375 for $249 which receives excellent reviews everywhere. However, this Pioneer popped up as a daily deal for $179.99 and I couldn't resist. Set-up wasn't overly difficult. Getting the speaker cables hooked up was the toughest part. I'm not an expert, but so far my equipment always had simple push connectors. These screw connectors are a pain in the neck. I had a flashlight in my mouth and fumbled quite  a while to get all speakers connected. I then discovered that our existing subwoofer from the home theater system wouldn't work with this receiver. It requires a powered subwoofer so I ended up paying another $89.95 to buy a powered subwoofer. I hardwired the receiver to my router through an ethernet switch and connected the TV with an optical audio cable. Once set up it worked like a charm. I need the manual (only comes as a pdf on a CD) to be able to use the advanced features on the remote (which I really don't need). The sound is more than sufficient for our needs and much better than the old system. We are glad, that we bought this unit because of it's advanced connectivity compared to the Yamaha. The ipod connects and gets charged through USB - which is great - but selecting songs from the playlist with the remote is not very convenient compared to doing it on the ipod screen. We haven't used AirPlay. We do love the internet radio !!  Again, accessing them through the remote isn't very convenient. It's far easier to set the radio stations up online and save them to favorites. The tablet remote control didn't work well for us. It kept giving us connectivity errors and we ended up using it.

I wanted something similar to Apple's earbuds that have that rubber design to help prevent slippage out of the ear, and these have that feature.  Audio from these headphones are better than I had expected. Highs are good, but the bass was surprising.  I had read other reviews that said bass was lacking, but there is some bass in there; not the sort that you'd receive from costlier in-ear/noise cancelling sets, but it's not like there isn't any at all. Probably from a scale of 1 to 10 in bass, they're a 6-7.  Overall comfort is good too. For my medium-small ears they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I've used them while washing my car (not that they're water-proof, just an example of time worn), walking around, jogging, and just music listening. Again, I especially love the rubber lining on the earbuds, as they help prevent the headphones from slipping out of my ears.

The only feature I don't seem to find use for is the built-in clips.  They're designed to clip onto your shirt when not in use, but when I'm not using them I just put them away in my pocket... =\

1248,8884,225262,225262,B004YIFOZ0,,4.0,"* Easy to follow instructions:
Not sure what the other 1 star reviewer was talking about, something about cheap instruction stickers that are directly on the protective screen(film), ruining the protective film when she tried to remove it. Just like another reviewer had stated, each film has a clear mask on each side when it is new, and yes, they look like cheap instruction stickers on the mask, but they are on the mask and NOT on the actual protective film. On the masks, one side says ""Step 1, clean tablet before applying film"", on that same side of the mask, another sticker says ""peel off this mask before applying the film"". Once you are done applying the film properly onto the screen, the mask on the other side of the film says ""peel off this mask AFTER film is positioned correctly"". Anyway, the instructions were very easy to follow.

* Thickness
It is 0.13 mm thick, feels thick, should help with accidental scratching.

* Problem
I did run into a problem, when trying to put on the first film. I cleaned the screen as instructed, I only applied about 2 inches of the film, using the smoothing card to remove the bubbles, then noticed a single bubble that would not go away, right below the camera, looked like there was a tiny speck of dirt under the film, causing the bubble, I pulled the film off and checked the film and screen, there was nothing visible, so I tried putting the film back on, same issue, got frustrated and crumbled the film and threw it out. Grabbed the second film, same exact problem, got frustrated and threw that out. So I decided to use the tablet without a screen protector. I did whip the screen by breathing on it and using your typical bath towel, without any scratches. So far, the tablet screen seems as durable as the screen on the iPod, which I never used a screen protector, and I whip the hell out of it with my shirt for over a year, without a single scratch. Oh well, wasted money on this, but it is not the product's fault, as far as I can tell. Since I've never had a screen protector on my iPod and I let my 4 yr old son play with it, since he was about 2.5 yrs old, and there is not a single scratch, I bought these for the tablet, mainly out of paranoia, just because of the brand new item mentality, kind of like having a brand new car, where you will baby the hell out of it at first.

* Star Rating
I'm giving this a 4 star, because I cannot say that I'm 100% sure that the problem was with the brand new screen protectors or not, since I was unable to see that single speck of dirt that may had been on the screen.

UPDATE 4/24/2013

I purchased this product on Amazon a little over a year ago.  Since then, I have had Jaybird (not Amazon) replace the headphones several times already.  I had to pay for shipping each time because Jaybird doesn't cover that.  The first few headsets worked at first but quit working for various reasons shortly thereafter.  The latest headset didn't work from the start.  (Won't receive a signal when the phone is in my pocket.)  I have had enough and wanted Jaybird to refund my money.  The customer service rep accused me of being a criminal trying to ""launder money"" since I originally bought the headphones from Amazon.  I can't get a refund from Amazon because it has been too long since I purchased the headphones.  The only reason it has been too long is that I  gave Jaybird a chance to rectify the situation.

I was really excited to finally find an iPod clock radio that I thought  met all my specifications -- no overly bright display to keep me awake at night, nice design, not to big a footprint and with a detachable speaker to give a nice stereo sound.  Then, came the reality.  After working with it for a few weeks, I found out that it does not do the one thing I wanted most --  an alarm that accesses the next track on my iPod nano each morning.  Instead, it simply accesses my songs list and starts at the beginning of that list every morning.  I would have been better off keeping my CD clock radio and just changing the CD each day to get some variety.

I contacted XtremeMac for tech support.  They said they had no reports of such a problem and could only suggest I download an alarm app (which doesn't apply to the nano ) and that they would check further to see it they could find a solution and get back to me in about a week (which I did not wait for less I lose the opportunity to return the radio for a refund).  I also did an online search to see if I could find info to resolve the problem on  my own.  No such luck!  The only stuff I could find applied to the iPhone and iPod touch; nothing for the nano!

Then I discovered that I could return it due to Amazon's generous holiday returns policy and that's what I did.

If you have an iPhone or iPod touch, my problem may not apply to you because the alarm app may resolve the problem I had.  But my advice would be to check to make sure the radio works as it is supposed to within the time frame for returning it so that you aren't stuck with a pretty but not-as-expected device!",first say two star rating applies radio amazon usual get five star really excited finally find ipod clock radio thought met specification overly bright display keep awake night nice design big footprint detachable speaker give nice stereo sound came reality working week found one thing wanted alarm access next track ipod nano morning instead simply access song list start beginning list every morning would better keeping cd clock radio changing cd day get variety contacted xtrememac tech support said report problem could suggest download alarm app apply nano would check see could find solution get back week wait le lose opportunity return radio refund also online search see could find info resolve problem luck stuff could find applied iphone ipod touch nothing nano discovered could return due amazon generous holiday return policy iphone ipod touch problem may apply alarm app may resolve problem advice would check make sure radio work supposed within time frame returning stuck pretty expected device,"01 29, 2012",ASEPEDRM9P9CD,E.

It's pretty good for a cheap mousepad.  To keep costs down the aluminum was made to be very thin and is backed by plastic ontop of rubber.  Most of the unit's 0.08"" (2mm) thickness is the plastic and rubber backing.  My unit also came warped, but I was able to bend it to lie flat on my desk--this could even be a feature, for those with uneven desks--however, it is fairly rigid.  The product looks pretty good in person, with some extra design flair where the surface finish is cut back at a (very shallow) angle near the edges to reveal an ~1mm shiny aluminum border.

Despite the thinness, I think this product should be durable and hold up to heavy usage.

System sounds great especially with Dvds and has that modern, clean look. Wires are connected on the bottom of the towers and hidden from view. The 4 towers are identical so you have symmetry in the room. Looks real sharp now compared to the old system I had with wires hanging down from the walls and stands.

I'm happy with this purchase, would have liked the ability to change the bass/treble settings but the standard settings still sound great, you can choose a number of preset sounds. The style, looks, and sound make this a good buy. But it won't replace high end components.

Decent volume levels especially with Dvds, I like it very loud at times. It' slow to load, and may have problems reading dirty dvds. I had one rented disc that had problems until I cleaned it, then it played fine. No issues with new Dvds or the ones I own.

First of all it is much quieter than the FE. This is to be expected, but the FE is already the quietest reference card on the market and is very tolerable compared to the old reference cards. The fans turn off unless while gaming and even then it is very quiet. Using my custom fan curve for benchmarking and keeping clocks at stock speeds this card does slightly better (2841) in Unigine Heaven 4.0 than the FE (2771).

With no fan curve it gets to around 75 deg C on load but remains rather quiet, and overall the noise is very similar to my EVGA ACX 2.0 I had on my GTX 970.

Lastly is price: for $611 this simply can't be beat. The options that come with this card (including stock OC and subjectively gimmicky RGB lighting) are too good to pass up.

I set up my Wireless Access Point and a Slingbox for example. Well, I knew something was up (prolly with the router settings) so I called Linksys Tech Support and it got routed to The Philippines. The lady asked me if I wanted to pay $9.99 and she would go into my computer and set it up herself using WebEx. I said, ""Sure - why not??"" I was already intrigued by this... even though I didn't think I should have to pay, but it's guaranteed or else you will not be charged.

After I paid, I spent about an hour with her and was able to see everything she was doing, which was manually. She also installed my camera software and set that up as well.  Of course, I had to be her assistant and plug the camera in and out and such. She did a pretty good job and I was able to ask her questions in regards to setting it up on the web. I would never have figured any of that out in that little time.

The Surfaces are pricey machines and have gotten some negative press regarding reliability lately, so I was excited to try the Switch Alpha 12 (this machine needs a better name).

After several months with the Acer as my primary machine, I can safely say its really very, very good. It feels every bit as powerful, the screen is fantastic, the case is strong and stable, and everything runs perfectly on it.

Acer has built in a nice system management app that makes setting up the Switch Alpha 12 quite easy, as is restoring it.  Ive used the app a couple of times to wipe the Switch Alpha 12 clean and set it up as a corporate machine and later as a home machine.

I wasn't able to try the Acer touch pen that mates with the Switch (it doesnt come included), but I used the machine all over the country in my office, on flights, in hotels, at conferences, you-name-it and there was never a situation where the machine felt out of place. On planes, the stand allows you to get a nice narrow angle if you're using the tray table.

At a desk (or wherever), Im comfortable using the Switch Alpha 12 with just the device and the keyboard cover, but also tested it using a Dell 24 U2417H display and wireless keyboard and mouse combo the display plugs right in to the Switch Alpha 12 through Mini DisplayPort and works flawlessly.

I installed the usual Office suite (Word/Excel), used it to manage servers, ran SQL server management studio, etc. and the i7 always feels fast! Some have noted the machine gets warm, and I guess it does but never uncomfortably so (at least not while I noticed it).

The keyboard cover is fantastic! I love it on the Surface, and I love it on the Switch Alpha 12. Its a fabric material that magnetically snaps in to place and it stays secure and is a PLEASURE to type on.

Battery life is good, too. I can typically work most of the day (on and off) without needing to carry around the power adapter or worry about it going dead. I doubt I could do an entire full day on one charge.

Overall, for the money, this is an excellent machine and a serious Surface competitor. Ive seen and used a couple others (Dells, Lenovos) and they're always well, not great. The Acer gets everything right and does it at a better price point than the Surface.

The Surface has a slightly better screen (color reproduction, mostly) and I like the Surfaces built-in stand more than Acers.

The usefulness of the inverter are clear: it saves you from needing an adapter for each one of your electronic devices that you want to use in the car -- it's one stop shopping. Anything with a two or three-prong plug can plug into it.

The inverter is small enough that it can easily fit into a glove box (taking up about as much space as a GPS) or into your computer bag.

During use I didn't notice anything unusual about the operation. Despite the fan it runs pretty quietly.

My one complaint is that the chord that goes into the cigarette lighter is so short that the inverter cannot reach the back seat or rear of the car. That means passengers are dependent on the people in the front of the car to plug and unplug devices. I took off one star for that.

It's a latest generation Samsung, and it's great, but it was too big for me to conveniently carry everywhere.  I checked, and most 8"" tablets would fit in my pants pocket.  I started looking, and I ordered this on a whim because Dell was selling a refurb for barely more than the cost of a Microsoft Office home and Student license (which is included).

It turns out I really like it a lot. I have barely used my larger (and much more expensive) tablet since I got this one.  I have read a lot of reviews from folks who have picked up an iPad mini or similar sized tablets who wind up preferring them to larger ones, and I will echo those thoughts.

Beyond the size, the reason I like it so much (again to my GREAT surprise) is Windows 8.1.  Really.  My family has two modern, powerful touch-screen laptops with Windows 8.1 on them.  I really don't like it in that application.  The ""metro"" (yes, I know that's not its real name, but it seems to be what folks still call it) touch screen interface is just horrible to me on a laptop.  I installed Classic Shell (which brings back the Start menu and boots to desktop mode) on my laptops, which really just about ""fixes"" what most folks hate about Windows 8.1. Still, sometimes you are forced into the metro screen, and it is still annoying.

BUT putting Windows 8.1 on a tablet changes everything.  The metro interface is clearly designed for tablet use, and it really shines there.  As much as I dislike the metro interface on the laptop, on the tablet, it is the desktop interface that is less satisfying.  The metro apps are fast, easy to use with fingers, and it is easy to switch between apps (all of those gestures, charms and swipes that are odd on a laptop now make perfect sense).  Web surfing, game playing and video watching are all as good as on any tablet I've used.  Having the built-in Word and Excel and the ability to run Windows programs are great bonuses (I even installed Civ 5 and played the touch-screen version. It's playable on this tablet, although the wait between turns is longer than on a modern full PC).

Even Internet Explorer (with one caveat) is a pleasure.  The swipe navigation is helpful, intuitive  and easy to use on a tablet.

Microsoft and Intel made some huge missteps in the launch of Windows 8 and windows tablets.  The first generation's Clover Trail atom processors were just not really up to the task of running a full desktop OS fluidly enough for many users.  The new Bay Trail atom processors are (no, they are not Haswell class, but they are not supposed to be that fast, either).

Having desktop and laptop users forced into a tablet desktop was also a terrible idea, but it sounds like Microsoft is finally realizing it.  The metro interface being run on a tablet with a powerful enough processor is great.  The Dell's screen is good, and is a pleasure to use.

Here are my nits, but none would deter me from recommending the tablet to a friend:

1.  The windows store is getting better, but it is far behind Google Play, much less Apple's app store in many areas.  I've been able to find an app for most of what I want to do, but the selection is nothing like the other ecosystems.

2. Here is the caveat for Internet Explorer.  Bing is integrated into the search feature.  Yes, you can go to the Google home page to run a search, but it's a pain and I wish Microsoft would let that thing go already.

Edit May 2, 2014:

I just was out of town and tried to use a capacitive stylus to annotate some PDF presentation slides.  You can't do that in the standard viewer app, but there are several apps available from the Windows store for relatively low cost.  I tried a couple, and unfortunately, I found it unworkable.  All I had was (a relatively good) capacitive stylus.  It was horrible.  It skipped so much as to make the annotations pointless.

It was run from switching equipment through a hole in the floor, across a plenum, and back up through a hole in the floor to a computer. After hooking it up, video was working fine with no noticeable loss, however I wasn't getting any audio across the cable. Thinking maybe there was an issue at the switching equipment or the computer, I troubleshooted the cable by plugging it directly into an audio source at one end and a known-working set of amplified speaker at another. No dice.

Unfortunately, I was in a bit of a pinch for time, so I didn't have time to send it back for exchange. Luckily I did have the ability to send audio over CAT-5 for the job, which I did to rectify the issue. But the issue remains that video works, audio does not.

I can only assume that there is some sort of defect in the cable (maybe a bad soldier on two of the RCA heads (because neither left or right audio worked)? Or worse yet, a break in the cable somewhere. Just thought it was odd.

503,8137,145315,145315,B004RTE5EC,,3.0,"A couple of years ago, I received this 59"" TV as a replacement for a Samsung 58"" 3-D TV bought in 2011, which was a nightmare.  This was after three service orders and writing to the Office of the President, presenting a formal complaint.

The good things about the Sammy PN59D8000: Slim modern design.  Great picture quality especially with B/R 3-D. Wide viewing angle.  Removable base that allows wall mounting.  Plenty of inputs and outputs.

The bad things about the Sammy PN59D8000:
* Internal speakers sound is mediocre making you need an external device for proper audio listening, especially with the high and low bass frequencies.
* Optical and sound digital output do not provide the 5.1 sound advertised.  You need an Amplifier/Receiver/Surround Bar Decoder to get the full 5.1 effect.  I have it with a 7.2 thanks to an Onkyo amplifier and supplemental speakers and sub-woofers.
* TV Outputs; HDMI and USB will not allow you to see or record TV programs as advertised by Samsung.  Note that Samsung's website even advertised specific storage devices made by WD to save recorded programs.
* Even though mislead, as of March 2014, the TV still does not have the capability of installing the Amazon Prime TV feature for those of us who are subscribed.  You might need to buy a Roku or a Google Chrome to get Amazon Prime movies.
* The Remote Control is a nightmare and a battery drainer.  Mine was replaces twice and ended up getting a Logitech complementary RC to be able to properly program recordings on the TV.
* The 3-D features are cumbersome as even though you need to wear the 3-D glasses included, it is a nightmare.  Samsung TVs have three separate settings for watching 3-D.  Horizontal, diagonal or side to side depending on the source.  The major problem is that if you are watching a 3-D  movie on any of the formats and you pause it, even with the glasses, you need to return the TV to the original 2-D format to even read/see what is next.  Crazy!!!
* As all Plasma TVs, this Sammy Plasma gets the room very warm, unlike my old Sony LCD Bravia from 2005 which does not generate any heat at all and after almost a decade, still works perfectly.

Thus, if you have read my review up to this part, consider getting a Panasonic, a Sony LCD or even an LG TV.  Have seen all these three and much better and cheaper alternatives than the Samsung PN59D8000 3-D Plasma.  As of March 2014, 3-D TV features are not worth.

I invite you to research on the legal suits against Samsung for false advertisement of several of the issues above mentioned.  Hope this helps your decision on which TV to get but stay away from 3-D and especially from Sammy products.

The flat cord is design is always more durable than the old round style,

The carry case is small and efficient.
They stay in my ears and do not fall out easily
I like the sound of the titanium and black pegs.

Con
The only Con is what actually make these earbuds different. It's the interchangeable sound pieces. They could be potentially easy to lose. I've dropped one every time I have tried to change them. Otherwise these are excellent earbuds!

281,6333,650590,650590,B01AYQWICW,,5.0,"Purchased a like-new refurbished unit from ZVOX through Amazon.  Speaker arrived in new packaging with all new accessories and looks like it is brand new.  This is an outstanding sound bar for the price.  I've been looking at and listening to high end  sound bars from Bowers and Wilkins and Paradigm,  While they sound great they simply aren't worth five times the price of this bar in my view.  If you value audiophile level sound but don't want to overpay I suggest you check this sound bar out.  Additionally, built in Bluetooth and numerous sound settings allow a great deal of placement flexibiiity.

Installation and setup were easy.  Unpack the sound bar, set it on a table, plug the digital optical cable into it from your source device, plug in the sound bar power cord and use the remote control to power it up.  That's it.  Ten minutes  max.  I'm using this with an LG PF1500 HD Projector which projects 110 inch picture on my living room wall.  I found a short stand to place the soundbar on and it sits out of the way below the wall.  Quite a compact setup which plays music and movies with amazing dynamic range on a very large screen.

The dynamic range, highs, mid range, and low end are finely balanced.  I don't see the need for a subwoofer but an output is available.  Music sounds very good and movies sound fantastic considering this is not a full 5.1 surround system.  Trust me on this.  In my basement I have an expensive 7.1 component sound system connected to a 65inch TV.  That system is state-of-the-art but requires a lot of real estate and wiring.  The SB500 can't compare in terms of surround capabilities but sonically it gets the job done with little wiring and lots less work.

As you may know, ZVOX has several features which help refine and tune the sound output and they all work as expected.  I tend to leave the settings neutral but with a slight bass level boost because of my large room.  Surround settings 1 or 2 work best in my room.  This soundbar turns itself on when a signal comes through the optical cable and turns off after about 15 minutes with no signal.  A very useful feature.  Would I like to have a $1500 B&W or Paradigm sound bar?  Sure.  I simply can't justify it knowing this sound bar comes close at one-fourth the price.

Highly recommended.",purchased like new refurbished unit zvox amazon speaker arrived new packaging new accessory look like brand new outstanding sound bar price looking listening high end sound bar bower wilkins paradigm sound great simply worth five time price bar view value audiophile level sound want overpay suggest check sound bar additionally built bluetooth numerous sound setting allow great deal placement flexibiiity installation setup easy unpack sound bar set table plug digital optical cable source device plug sound bar power cord use remote control power ten minute max using lg pf hd projector project inch picture living room wall found short stand place soundbar sits way wall quite compact setup play music movie amazing dynamic range large screen dynamic range high mid range low end finely balanced see need subwoofer output available music sound good movie sound fantastic considering full surround system trust basement expensive component sound system connected inch tv system state art requires lot real estate wiring sb compare term surround capability sonically get job done little wiring lot le work may know zvox several feature help refine tune sound output work expected tend leave setting neutral slight bass level boost large room surround setting work best room soundbar turn signal come optical cable turn minute signal useful feature would like b w paradigm sound bar sure simply justify knowing sound bar come close one fourth price highly recommended,"12 8, 2017",A19HKRB4LU5YR,DJ,{'Style:': ' Soundbar only'},Excellent Sound -- Incredible build quality.,1512691200,True,5,1

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------Response
from RCA about Commercial Advance before Purchase: Dear Customer:  Thank
you for your inquiry on your product.  During tape playback, the
""Commercial Advance"" feature allows you to avoid watching most
commercials on any recording over 15 minutes long. After the VCR
finishes recording, the Commercial Advance system locates and
electronically marks most of the commercial segments. When the recording
is played back, the VCR scans or fast forwards through the marked
segments. Either a blue screen or the fast motion video of the
commercial itself can be displayed while commercials are being advanced
through.  Commercial Advance reduces three minutes of commercial time to
approximately ten seconds (SLP mode) of fast forwarding time.  We
received your inquiry and appreciate your interest in our line of
products.  Thomson products are normally available from most mass
merchants or discount stores, catalog showrooms, department stores, and
drug, hardware, and variety stores. Please consult your Yellow Pages, or
call 1-580-634-0123 for dealers in your area. Retail pricing information
can also be obtained from your local dealers. We do not establish prices

Feature Definitions and their Use -- Not Applicab le --  Rikki  Thanks
for the response.  My main question was to verify that this RCA Unit,
has  Commercial Scan/Advance  which automatically bypasses commercials
on playback as opposed  to  Commercial Skip in which a button has to be
manually pressed for  each  30-60 seconds.  I do not want the latter.
Does RCA also sell ProScan VCR's? If so, where are they  available?
They are very difficult to locate. I have an old ProScan with

When I opened the plain white box that it came in I found a RT-N66R instead of the RT-N66U.  From what I have been able to determine the R is the retail version of the U and is sold by Best Buy.  Setup was pretty straight-forward and I didn't encounter any problems getting my wireless devices working except for a Brother laser printer.  Re-installation of the printer software and re-doing the network setup for the printer corrected the problem.  I've only been using the router for a few days but judging from my limited experience I would say that this router is amazing.  Signal strength is surprisingly good.  My old router was a Linksys E2000 and I was having signal strength issues on my Sony home entertainment setup using the proprietary Sony network adapter.  Signal strength was 52% at best with the Linksys router.  After I installed the ASUS RT-N66R the signal strength shot up to 100%.  Amazing.  No more problems streaming movies.  Signal strength on my notebook and tablet is at least 4 (out of 5) bars anywhere in my house and garage.

So, it's best to use the button on the headphones to answer and end calls.  As far as distance goes, I was able to walk 27 feet away from my phone before the music began to cut out.

2766,390,193800,193800,B0042A68R8,,4.0,"TL;DR version:

These headphones offer an impressive combination of quality and comfort, especially for the price. Excellent for home use, but not a very good choice for use in public, and you will want an aftermarket cable for mobile use. If you are new to high-quality headphones like me, you will probably be quite satisfied with these. If you don't care about bass too much, I suggest you go up to the HD 558s, as they will be more comfortable and have a wider soundstage. Or maybe even the HD 598s. These headphones are not very bassy, nor very bright; If this signature is not what you are going for, I would suggest you give a look at Sony, Shure, Grado, and Audio-Technica models in the $70-$150 price range, as they also look to be very smart options for both closed- and open-backed headphones.

+ Impressive clarity and soundstage with a balanced and relaxed blend of bass, mid-range, and treble, the latter of which is not sibilant at all
+ Requires no additional hardware, such as amplifiers or sound cards.
+ Very comfortable cloth padding which offers a firm fit, even during exercise
+ Interchangeable cables with a locking mechanism

+/- Build quality seems good for what it is made out of, but it doesn't feel particularly tough

- Default 3.5mm adapter is bulky, as is the separate HD5x8 3.5mm cable from Sennheiser, hindering mobile use
- Leaks more sound than some other open-backed headphones

In-depth review + background:

For starters, I am not an audiophile in the least. But I will probably be one, some day. I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my old and reliable Logitech H390 headset. If you want you can skip this paragraph, which is just a background and the difference between the 5x8 models. I've put many, many hours into researching headphones in order to make a smart purchase. I originally was looking for those great bang-for-your-buck headphones in the $30-$50 range, like the Panasonic RP-HTF600S, JVC HARX700, and so on, and I almost bought the Panasonics! But I felt that there were too many sacrifices in that low budget range (and indeed there will still be with these, but not enough to make me regret anything). I could get something fun, but it wouldn't have all the features that I wanted, and vice versa. Then, I found the HD 5x8 range just sitting there right outside of my budget. The 518, 558, and 598 all have the same sound drivers, and the main difference between them is a gradual shift from bass to treble and with each succeeding headphone having a wider soundstage and more comfortable fit. I wanted as much bass as I could get out of this line, so I opted for the 518. The price difference also may have had a part in that decision.

There may be objectively better sounding headphones around this price range. There may be funner headphones around this price range. But I think that these headphones have one of the best combinations of sound quality and features you can get without investing more money into additional hardware. Do you need an amp for these headphones? No. I have yet to put my volume higher than 50% on both my PC and my smartphone, at least in regards to music. (But I have heard people recommend an amp for boosting the bass) Do you need a sound card? No, I put some time into that as well. A budget sound card shouldn't make much of a difference at all. If you're getting a higher end sound card, why are you using it with these entry-level headphones? These are just great with onboard audio, assuming your motherboard is relatively modern.

SOUND SIGNATURE AND QUALITY: When I was looking for headphones, I was looking for a sound signature that did not have any artificial-sounding bass, nor should it have any sibilance in the treble. I wanted headphones that had a respectable oomph to the bass when the song called for it, and I also required a wide soundstage to offer great instrument separation. I listen to a lot of jazz, swing (classic and electronic), funk, r&b, soul, 70s-80s pop, new age, meditation music, a bit of choir, opera, and classical, and a whole lot of metal (traditional, thrash, death, black, sludge, doom, progressive, experimental, you name it). But most importantly, I listened to a lot of music with reverb, lots of instruments, and/or a lot of intricate layers. I wanted to explore the music, appreciate every instrument, and discover little vocal tracks or ambient noises hiding underneath the surface. Either incidentally or intentionally, a lot of music I listen to has a dirty recording (I was worried I would hate everything that was intentionally low-fi. But that was not the case).

These headphones delivered EXACTLY what I was looking for! Or at least after some burn-in. And if the above description sounds like what you are looking for too, then yes obviously I highly recommend these. Right out of the box, cymbals were sharp and layers sounded melted together, but these issues reversed rather quickly. Everything sounds crisp, and each sound gets its own corner. These headphones deliver a pleasurable, but not emphasized, bass to satisfy many people. I realize how flat and boring headsets sound now, these Sennheisers offer a TEXTURE and suddenly my music has mass. Hidden bass riffs are revealed, downtuned riffs sound visceral, and bass kicks more like bass punches you know what I mean? If you are looking for bass that you could swim in, these are not for you unfortunately. I could focus on so many lesser sounds in my music that I struggled to find before. Lyrics, which may have been hidden before, are now clear. My situational awareness in first-person shooters is also heightened now. Before I could only tell the vague direction in which an enemy was moving about. The binaural sound was so effective that at times I thought one of my drivers failed. Explosions and gunshots, if properly produced, sound quite a bit more forceful too. I am not big on the sound production in movies, so I can't really speak for that audience. On the matter of ASMR, the bass response and soundstage benefit the microphone manipulation and 3D audio considerably. Perhaps it would sound 100% genuine if the artists had professional production skills and/or equipment and/or more creative techniques. Not to say that they are bad; it's not about the authenticity anyway.

CORD & MOBILE USE CONSIDERATIONS: These headphones have a open-backed design, and I shouldn't have to tell you that these leak a lot of sound. However I kinda do, because these leak a lot more than other open-backed headphones I've come across. On a volume that I consider normal and fun, and in a controlled environment (completely silent house), I was able to faintly hear the sound from my room out in the hallway, over 25 feet! Of course that was with the door open, too. I would NOT recommend these for use in libraries or any similar quiet place that requires productivity unless you are going putting the volume rather low. In which case, somebody sitting next to you shouldn't notice.

The cord (thank the lord) is detachable and locks into place. This was one of the features I wanted when considering my options. The default cord feels pretty solidly built, but it is just normal rubber. A deep plastic sound is heard in the left ear when it is manipulated. About ten feet in length, ending with a 6.3mm plug and it comes with a 3.5mm adapter. In my environment, that is great because I can do yoga, operate my elliptical or exercise bike, and lay on my bed across the room while still listening to my music or whatever. More on the fit during those actions later. Sennheiser makes a 4.5 foot cable with a 3.5mm plug and 6.3mm adapter, however it looks just as bulky in width, which will probably stop you from plugging this into your smartphone if it has a case on it. Yes, you will have to take the case off for a proper connection. And if you do, the 6.3mm + 3.5mm adapter will induce an unsightly ~3 inch protrusion upon your mobile device.

HOWEVER, there are third-party cables being made by NewFantasia and sold here on Amazon. These appear to be of high quality and come in an unnecessary amount of lengths, ending in normal-sized 3.5mm plugs, and may come with braided cables or an in-line mic + volume control (the latter one does seem to affect sound quality and it's pretty short so I find the short cable + away-from-the-desktop controls to be useless). If you are going to take these for mobile use, I suggest you add one of NewFantasia's cables to your shopping cart as well.

BUILD QUALITY & FIT: It's all a bunch of hard plastic and it's fairly light, but it doesn't necessarily feel flimsy. I imagine it could take a few drops, as my flimsy H390 have taken many beatings over the years and still work great. Manipulating the headphones does not cause any creaking noises, which is good, and I do not feel like they will break in my hands. The earcups have a nice bit of movement to adjust to your head near-perfectly. At first the fit was a little tight, but they've broken in quite nicely. The soundstage seems to be best when you adjust the headphones so that your ears sit in the back. I wear glasses, and these will make a sort of squeaking noise if I move my head around certain ways due to the glasses rubbing against the cloth earpads, but it doesn't bother me often, and you can just hold the headphones in place when you move your head to the side to stop them from rubbing together. Oh yeah the earpads. They're cloth. And they are rather comfortable, firm but a little squishy.

These headphones aren't uncomfortable in the least. I usually wear them for the good part of my day, being a total nerd. But I do feel pretty relieved when I take them off. Unfortunately the ear cups are too big to wear these headphones around my neck comfortably. I feel like I have a neck brace on when trying to move my head about. I mentioned I do yoga with these, and lay down with them on as well. Yes you can do these things, and comfortably! The ears may get warm during exercise, but they will not get as hot as if you had leather or pleather earpads. These will stay on up-side down, but they will slide back if you tilt your head backwards. Wearing these backwards or wearing the headband towards your forward remedies this, however.

2 of the 4 speakers are passive, which means they do not work, or a better term is they are FAKE. Why would Logitech think we want to pay for FAKE speakers?!

Why not do better and make 3 of the 4 speakers passive if they want to make money for nothing?!

There is even a picture on the box that depicts sound coming from all 4 speakers equally. No sound at all comes from the 2 bottom passive speakers!

These speakers have an OK only sound, but just as good as lots of speakers that are less than half the size. And I have owned speakers in the past that were less than half the size that were twice as loud and sounded much better.

2056,5455,222287,222287,B004WNLOHO,,5.0,"I have 3 HP DL360 servers, each equipped with 4 Intel SSD's in a RAID 5 configuration.  As the load on each of these servers increased, I needed an easy way of adding more storage without buying additional servers.  The Sans Digital external TowerRAID seemed to be exactly what I was looking for and so far, after 3 weeks of testing in our development environment, it has worked beautifully.

The TowerRAID was ordered along with four Intel 120 GB SSD's.  We carved out 3 virtual machines running on the server, each using TowerRAID as the primary drive.  The VM's being used are primarily as web servers running IIS and as a report server.  In each case, performance between the HP DL360's internal RAID drives (also using Intel SSD's) and the TowerRAID is indistinguishable. The TowerRAID is connected using the eSata controller which came with it.

Since we had decided for reliability reasons to use Intel SSD's, the option of running Sata III was not an issue.  Intel's SSD's run at a maximum of 3G whereas new SSD's using a Sandforce controller, will run faster.  But for us that wasn't an option without replacing the internal RAID controllers on each of the HP servers.  Plus, the nature of our application is such that it's running a large number of small SQL Server databases and running ASP and ASP dot net.  The ability to quickly find small amounts of data in the database or to quickly run one of the 750 ASP programs comprising the system is critical to maintaining high performance.  The Intel SSD's are absolutely perfect for this since their access times are way faster than a traditional hard drive and at the same time we aren't flooding the controller with lots of data.

636,9898,218142,218142,B009CWJRWY,,3.0,"I knew only 3 brackets were needed after reading the reviews but the instructions were accurate besides this omission. I wish most companies would post a quick setup video on their web site in this internet age.
Everything was going quite well until the last step when I had to  attach the projector bracket to the ceiling bracket but only one of the three screw holes would line up. Furthermore one hole was not keyed for a screw at all. I ended up using two screws instead of three after using a drill to open up the hole a bit on the outside mount to get it to line up  the ceiling base. The mount looks sturdy enough for a toddler to swing from so I will not bother processing a return.
I would draw special attention to step 3C in the instruction manual where one bolt needs to be screwed to the top cover on the projector. This bolt is the lock to the twist/release mechanism in its absence the projector can fall by accident as reported by a reviewer.  My projector is mounted behind a 14 inch beam so I was concerned with getting the image high enough on the wall pass the beam but the mount provides enough flexibilily to lock it at various angles.
Update: Locking the picture inside the screen frame was a bit challenging. It required an extra set of hands to hold the projector as shaking from locking kept knocking the picture off alignment. There is a screw you can fiddle with to make it less sensitive but it requires some patience. I recommend against angling your projector for a pure HT setup which can result in keystone correction and white light overspraying outside of your frame.
Keep in mind that the mounting holes are set at 2 inches, 9.5 and 11.5 inches on the extension bracket.",knew bracket needed reading review instruction accurate besides omission wish company would post quick setup video web site internet age everything going quite well last step attach projector bracket ceiling bracket one three screw hole would line furthermore one hole keyed screw ended using two screw instead three using drill open hole bit outside mount get line ceiling base mount look sturdy enough toddler swing bother processing return would draw special attention step c instruction manual one bolt need screwed top cover projector bolt lock twist release mechanism absence projector fall accident reported reviewer projector mounted behind inch beam concerned getting image high enough wall pas beam mount provides enough flexibilily lock various angle update locking picture inside screen frame bit challenging required extra set hand hold projector shaking locking kept knocking picture alignment screw fiddle make le sensitive requires patience recommend angling projector pure ht setup result keystone correction white light overspraying outside frame keep mind mounting hole set inch inch extension bracket,"03 17, 2015",A3IZWF7NATWMOB,Paul Joseph,{'Style:': ' CM00G2'},Mount is decent with Caveats,1426550400,True,,0

I've installed various other screens on my other PDA's.  This product is unlike some of the other screen protectors as it requires the spray that comes with the product.

As I usually do, I turned the shower on to knock out the dust in the air, washed my hands and wiped the screen with the lint free cloth provided with the kit.  I then removed the screen from the sheet and sprayed it down on the contact side with the spray bottle provided.  I also gave a couple of sprays directly on the ipad's screen, and then placed the protector as per the instructions.  With the rubber wedge provided, I squeegeed the remaining fluids, and I wiped the excess with a microfiber towel.

After completing the process, I couldn't wait and turned on my Ipad sooner than recommended.  As the product hadn't fully dried, there was a slight rainbow effect.  About an hour after use, the rainbow effect diminished and was completely gone a couple of hours thereafter.  At first there seemed to be some spray residue on the screen, but the next day all residue and rainbow effect were completely gone and it was crystal clear.

I've now used this product for several days, and have noticed that it feels great.  It has a little rubbery give, and makes the screen more scratch resistant than my other harder plastic screens.

1099,7196,532007,532007,B00PVD13KC,,5.0,"This camera has an amazingly clear picture and impressive features that function as described. Although I get things to review for Vine for Amazon, I rate the item as I think it deserves. This camera earned these five stars. I didn't even know how handy this would be until I  placed it in my son's room t ensure he was doing his homework, and not playing on the computer while I was cooking. Don't worry, I didn't leave it in there. That would be creepy. It also came in handy when my daughter was sick in bed. If she needed something, she just had to say so, and I'd hear her. It was also easy to check on her just by looking on my iPad.

What I like:
-Easy setup (see below). I downloaded the app, scanned the QR card and the app walked me through the steps. I used the WPS method (you just push a button on your router and then hold the WPS button on the camera for six seconds so they can find each other). My Galaxy Note found the router without a hitch.  As far as the camera goes, you just plug it in. You then create an account using the app and log in to see your camera view.
-Superb resolution. 720p and not grainy at all.
-Good color, not black and white like cheaper cameras.
-Excellent refresh rate. It's not choppy like a webcam. The movement was pretty smooth 95% of the time.
-180 degree lens. I couldn't believe how much of the room the 180 degree lens picks up. At first, I was disappointed that you couldn't pan and tilt, but then I realized you don't need to if it's set up in a corner of the room.
-Can use with apple products, android and windows. I tried it with my iPad 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
-Night vision (seriously rocks). You can see everything in the dark. Of course it's grayscaled.
-Recording capabilities. I didn't try that, but it's good to know you can use a micro SD card.
-Zooming. You can pinch your iPad or phone to zoom in. It pixelates some if you zoom really close, but overall the picture still stays reasonably clear. Very cool.
-Sound. The sound quality is very clear and a really unexpected feature.
-Small, light weight and portable.
-Motion sensor with push alerts. I didn't try that feature, but it can come in handy when you get a notification and no one is supposed to be at home. I'm sure my cats would trigger that all the time.
-Long cord. Long enough to reach from ceiling to floor and then some.
-Portable. You just plug it into a socket, place it on a shelf and you're good to go.
-Snap shot feature. You can take a picture with the app. It's not something I will probably use, but it's a neat feature. I guess if there is someone in your house that shouldn't be there and you're not recording, you can take snap shots for evidence.
-Expansion. You have the ability to buy more cameras, set them up in different locations, set all the cameras up on your account and toggle between camera views on the app. Nice.

What I don't like:
-Ipad 2 connection problems. At first, my iPad couldn't connect with the camera. I took several tries. Finally, it connected, but then lost the camera a few hours after. It wasn't even on my list of cameras on the app. That resolved in a strange way. I downloaded the app onto my Galaxy Note, it connected instantly and then magically the camera showed up on my iPad. Very strange. But it has disappeared again on my iPad. So it's all good.
-The two red lights staring at me at night in the dark like evil demon eyes. Creepy, but not a game changer.
-Not sure about the security. You have to log into your account to access the camera on your phone, iPad or computer, but is there a risk that others can accidentally access your feed? I'm not techy enough to know the ins and outs.
-It gets rather warm, so make sure not to cover it with anything to prevent a fire hazard.

Something to note, although it doesn't affect anything, there's about a 5-7 second real time lag. It's kind of amusing to watch yourself move five seconds in the past when you bring up the screen on you phone.

192,6230,225405,225405,B004YIIKK6,,4.0,"10/05/2013 - Have owned this product for 2 weeks and taken it on four 35 minute 4 mile runs so far.
I use this with a Motorola Razr HD Maxx from 2012.

5 star scale.

Fit = *****
Lightweight, fits comfortably, forget you have it on. I am 6ft, 200 lbs. Not huge. Not small. Normal non-George Lopez style head.  Do not be concerned with the size of the discs over your ears like I was. They are small. Not as small as just earbuds. (though they have nice earbuds with two sets of comfortable rubber covers. People can see they are different, but not ridiculously so. People have told me they like the way they look. The discs do not make your ears feel covered or warm. For me that would be a deal breaker in hot weather. These are fine. The disc size makes the controls very ergonomic.  I wear these with no additional support and they DO NOT fall out.

Battery Life = *****
Suites my needs. I run twice for 35 minutes on the weekend. Then I charge it and put it away. Take it out a week later and get 2 runs out of it with power to spare.

Sweatproof = *****
So far so good.  I have had 2 very expensive Motorola S11 fail on me due simply to sweat while running. The design of these seems to keep sweat off important parts pretty well. They have not died yet on some very sweaty runs. I am hopeful. Will update on how these hold up. So far so good.

Ergonomics, controls, buttons = ****
This is one of the best parts of the design. The buttons are REALLY well placed and very easy to access to raise/lower volume or change tracks while running. Pause is so-so, but might be my phone. Sometimes it doesn't pause. Sometimes that starts another music player. Amazon MP3 player doesn't seem to have a setting to tell it not to respond to headset and keeps coming up. Sometimes pause is just ignored.
Starts up, shuts down, pairs readily when button is pressed as directed.

Pairing =  *****
Easy, no hassle pairing.

Reception = *****
When I wear on my right arm as directed, NEVER drops. My moto dropped consistently, but maybe had it on wrong arm. Never tried other one.  If I put this one on my left arm, drops sound like moto.

Sound Quality = ***
Sound is Okay. I can get by with it. Reliability with the sweat issue, makes the sound tolerable. Better so-so sound than no sound.  That said, seems to have limited range. Base is not all that powerful. Treble is better, even so, everything seems to lack dimension.  The $100 Moto S11 blew these away as did my Moto HT820, but for the price and what these are. They are passible. I may look into whether Jaybirds sound better. Will be keeping these though as a nice utility headset.

Call Quality = ****
I am shocked to say that these things don't do too badly on calls. Thus far, no one has complained that they cannot hear me. In that regard, they are better than my S11's which people would always immmediately let me know they couldn't understand me.  I gave them a 4 star on this because I did get a little feedback that I wasn't sounding completely clear.

1881,4907,93822,93822,B001OI2VXG,,3.0,"I have several Canon digital cameras, so when I decided to purchase a camcorder I immediately went to Canon.  I waited a month for this new version.  I wanted a small camcorder--and this is definitely small.

I am a bit disappointed in the quality of the videos.  For movies taken in full light I can hardly tell the difference between these movies and the ones I take with my Canon PowerShot A570 IS digital camera! Although, the sound is definitely better with the camcorder.  For movies in dim light (I filmed my son's Jazz concert), there was a huge difference so I decided to keep the camera.

I would agree with the previous reviewer in that the control buttons on the LCD screen are practically useless in dark settings.  I couldn't see them during the concert I filmed.

I also have a bit of trouble holding the camera because it is so small.  I removed the ""grip belt"" strap it came with because I could not get it to fit securely and still allow me to adjust the buttons at the same time.  It felt like the camera was going to slide off my hand. I now use the extra wrist strap that comes with the camera and while it doesn't look as ""cool"", I'm not worried about dropping the camera.

My biggest hassel has been that the camera saves the movie files as MOD files which are a pain to work with! They will not import into most video editing programs (including Adobe Premiere Elements!), and the widescreen videos will not play correctly in Windows Media Player unless you convert the file.

The camera comes with a software program to transfer, edit, and view the movies--but it is awkward to use and even with the conversion I still could not get the movies to import into Camtasia Studio 6, which is the program I use the most.  So, after two days of internet searching this is what I found that works for me.

1. I use a card reader to transfer the movie files onto my computer. This is much easier for me than using the program that comes with the camera.

2. I downloaded a free copy of SDCopy, and I use it to convert the MOD files to mpeg files.  If I check the ""widescreen"" box on the converting window the converted movies will play widescreen in Windows Media Player.

3. The converted movies will import into Adobe Premiere, but they will not import into Camtasia Studio 6 (which is my goal). I can use Adobe Premiere to convert the files to avi files, but the process takes too long for me so I found a better and easier way.

4. I purchased a MOD converter.  The one I decided on was Daniusoft Mod Converter for $29.  It works well. With a MOD converter, I can convert the MOD files to a bunch of other types that will import into other programs as well as play on other devices such as an ipod.  I use it to convert the files I converted with SDCopy into .avi files that will import into Camtasia.

Bottom line: Do your research and decide if this is for you.  The FS100 received so many good reviews that I can't help but wonder if the video quality of that camera is better than this one.  Perhaps someone will post information that answers that question.",several canon digital camera decided purchase camcorder immediately went canon waited month new version wanted small camcorder definitely small bit disappointed quality video movie taken full light hardly tell difference movie one take canon powershot digital camera although sound definitely better camcorder movie dim light filmed son jazz concert huge difference decided keep camera would agree previous reviewer control button lcd screen practically useless dark setting see concert filmed also bit trouble holding camera small removed grip belt strap came could get fit securely still allow adjust button time felt like camera going slide hand use extra wrist strap come camera look cool worried dropping camera biggest hassel camera save movie file mod file pain work import video editing program including adobe premiere element widescreen video play correctly window medium player unless convert file camera come software program transfer edit view movie awkward use even conversion still could get movie import camtasia studio program use two day internet searching found work use card reader transfer movie file onto computer much easier using program come camera downloaded free copy sdcopy use convert mod file mpeg file check widescreen box converting window converted movie play widescreen window medium player converted movie import adobe premiere import camtasia studio goal use adobe premiere convert file avi file process take long found better easier way purchased mod converter one decided daniusoft mod converter work well mod converter convert mod file bunch type import program well play device ipod use convert file converted sdcopy avi file import camtasia bottom line research decide f received many good review help wonder video quality camera better one perhaps someone post information answer question,"05 14, 2009",AMBFK6N4JS5Z2,V.

I've now switched to Harmony 650 as my main remote.  Really enjoy it.

 Hardware quality and ergonomics:  5
Just feels right in the hand. Lightweight.  Buttons are well placed, response is easy, springy.  Screen is very readable.  Backlit fixed buttons.  Sleek appearance.  High build quality.

 Price:  5
Downright cheap for a quality universal remote.  Most are priced multiple times higher.

 Software:  4
Stable. Attractive features.  Learning curve was longer than expected (6 sessions so far).  Lots of custom options, plus individual button programming and learning of buttons from your old remote.  Some features are locked down with no customization, yet there's still enough flexibility to do a lot.  My chief complaint was having to program by hand each button of my blu-ray player; though I selected its model from the database, Harmony decided each button (left, right, up, down, pause, play, FF, rewind, chapter prev/next) should control my TV rather than my blu-ray player.  I came back to the PC, examined the programming, and manually reprogrammed each blu-ray button, twice (once for ""Activities,"" then once again for ""Device"" control for the same player).  Hey, at least a workaround was supported.

Getting past that annoyance, ""Activities"" works beautifully for simple or complex sequences.  For instance:  my older AV receiver lacks HDMI, so I use ""Activities"" to select its audio input channel, plus a matching HDMI choice from an external switcher, plus a TOSlink optical audio channel.  Harmony 650 manages this seamlessly.

At this price, I bought a spare.  Harmony software syncs programming to the first remote, then syncs the same settings to the spare.  Nice.

Really appreciate how the most frequently used buttons (play, pause, reverse, FF, record, stop) are located near the base, where your hand holds the remote.  (Oddly, Harmony's more expensive models such as the Ultimate One, place those frequently used buttons at the top where it seems you would need two hands to use it - one to hold the remote near the base, the other to push pause/play/rewind, etc.)

Hope my tips help as you shop for your universal remote.

Plus genuine Nikon grips don't wobble around like aftermarket grips do.

Anyways the grip arrived 4 days early! That's really good if you ask me. The box arrived in perfect condition. The grip itself was also flawless.

The main reason why I bought this grip is because I like to shoot with primes. So I usually just carry two bodies around with me. I wasn't going to buy a second grip for my other D7000 because these grips used to sell for $250+ a few years ago. But when I saw that Adorama was selling these for $169 I said screw it and bought myself an early Christmas present.

If you ask me I think Nikon should be selling all of their grips for $169. They ask  $350 for their newer grips which is ridiculous if you ask me.

I bought the MRX-V70 to eliminate the need for multiple amplifiers and provide clean sound, and after one month, I am very happy with the result.

The V70 could not have been a more perfect match for these speakers. The amp I received was rated at 99x4, and 373w x1 which nails the RMS of my speakers. Now, I am not one for the blow your ear drums setup (though this setup so far can go louder than I can stand without distortion), I simply wanted complete range and tone that's loud enough to drown out my engine and exhaust mods when I want it to. This does the job, again, perfectly.

As for the installation, the amp itself is very small, so I had many options of where to install it. I ended up installing it under my front driver's seat using the pre-cut carpet holes for the power seat with with wires sharing the power seat control wire covers, and because of this, it is impossible to know that there is anything installed other than the head unit. Additionally, because this is a single class D amp, I found that the power draw is incredibly low compared (actually, to even a single amp I ran before from Fosgate let alone) the setup I had before.

First problem is that the software is problematic, you can make a change to the router and not be able to access the settings to undo the changes.

The warranty only covers you for either 30 or 60 days, so if you have trouble with a computer, phone, printer or anything else after that, you have to pay a third-party support company to basically click a button in order to restore your device to factory settings.

That doesn't sound like a good plan, but also it is only offered by yearly support, and the cost of the support is more than a newer, better model from a top competitor.

578,4304,193739,193739,B00427TAIK,,5.0,"I suffered for a while with a standard mouse.  Arm pains, elbow pains, wrist pains. Took me a while to take the leap and spend so much on a new mouse.  Mice are supposed to be a dime a dozen - in fact I had a few high quality mice which still gave me pain. It got really bad.

So finally, I decided to buy the Evoluent Vertical Mouse. After much research on different ergonomic mice and trying a trackball (no way couldn't get used to it) and trying a few other options short of spending so much on a darn mouse - I realized it was either this or nothing - I took the leap and bought it.

Super glad I did.  For the first couple weeks I thought I made a mistake buying this mouse. It was somewhat awkward and at first didn't fully relieve the pain. But I stuck with it. Slowly, I started not to notice the mouse when using it (which is a good thing).  I also don't know exactly how long it took but I had no more pain. And I am now actually almost as accurate in movement as my standard mouse of 20 years.

While I think 20+ years of using a regular mouse is hard to break - it took about 1-2 months until I was totally comfortable with the Evoluent Mouse - But now I LOVE IT and cant go back. Whenever I switch to using a regular mouse (even those ones that claim to be ergonomic but really just have a curve to them) I notice right away the strain put on my arm.

The build quality is excellent, the color and style are attractive. I am picky and find I am very satisfied with this mouse. They did not cut corners on the build quality - very nice.

I HIGHLY recommend this mouse and would not hesitate to get it again if I need to.  But you must give it a fair chance to work and I think you will find yourself not even noticing it has cured your pain - which is the way it should be.  Now, to get myself a better keyboard.

UPDATE: After using this mouse for many months - I am happier than ever with my purchase. You must give it time to get out of old habits. You might notice other minor arm pains for a bit as you get used to it but it is totally worth it. I couldn't live without it and don't understand how other use regular mice.

Now I need to get one for work and I will be all set.

It turns out I was expecting too much for a small tube shaped camera.  The other cameras I have are the Ion Air Pro Lite, Sena Prism Tube and some other no-name tube cam not worth naming.  This cam by far has the most features.  Ion may have tried to cram too many features into this cam.  Not all the non essential features will work well, but I don't use them all anyway.  The ones I do use seem to work well.  This review will basically be a comparison with the Sena Prism Tube.  .

What the Air Pro 3 HAS, where the Prism Tube does not: Very wide viewing angle. Once accustomed to having this extra wide angle available, it's hard to live with a narrower angle.  You can select different recording resolutions, although I leave mine at 1080 / 30fps all the time. It takes still photos, actually pretty nice ones at 12 megapixels.  The Prism Tube does not take still shots.  It has a built-in mic, but also has a standard mic jack for an external mic.  So, you don't need a proprietary mic.  The Prism Tube has no built-in mic, and requires a proprietary mic.  It has image stabilization. I questioned if the stabilization was actually working for a while, but when comparing with the Prism Tube which does not have stabilization, I can tell it's working.  Video is also not distorted during vibration and movement.  The Prism Tube's image sometimes seems jagged or distorted.  It is water proof, not just water resistant.  You can take it underwater up to 3 meters as long as the rear cover is attached.  Color is pretty accurate in all lighting conditions.  With the Prism tube, bright lighting often can throws off color balance.

What this does NOT have that the Prism Tube does have:  It's at least 30% larger in diameter than the Prism Tube.  I wish they would have made this cam a little smaller instead of trying to pack too many features into it.  I don't need WiFi, social media sharing, etc.  It doesn't have a side mount for your helmet.  I had to make my own.  Underwater videos and images are blurry.  In all fairness, the Prism Tube can't even go underwater.  Sound quality, even with a good external mic is poor.  It doesn't seem to pick up low tones at all.

So, iON, I'm sorry I gave you a bad initial review.

1275,1596,312768,312768,B0090QXFP2,,5.0,"This is for EVERYONE before they start using the camera. UPDATE THE FIRMWARE!!!

The firmware is actually for the lens and not the camera itself. However, you have to update it through the camera with the lens attached to it. YOUR HYBRID FOCUS WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT THIS UPDATE!!. You also need to turn on phase detection AF to have hybrid AF. I've seen ""professional"" reviewers bashing the slow focus and bad night time AF when they're so professionally inclined to do a simple update job.

Hybrid AF = phase detection + contrast detection. Phase detection AF works great and as intended. It is faster than I can press a stopwatch. I do notice that phase detection does not work with illumination light or low aperture. Low aperture means a high fxx number! remember that! But even in my dark bedroom with only 1 lamp + shades, I am still at about F4.0-5.5 on the stock 1855 and therefore phase detection still works like magic.

I bumped ISO to 3200 and sometimes 6400 in my room to compensate for lack of light and pictures still came out with relatively low noise. I noticed my camera tends to underexpose a tiny bit so I bump EV +.3. However, this is only using the camera's LCD. I have not have time to upload the pics on my comp.

I did get the 10fps speed continuous. However, it really is only for the first 10 frames. Then it feels like 3 fps afterwards. This is with the Sandisk extreme class 10 UHS 1 45mb/sec. The Nex 5R does not support UHS so it reverts to class 10.

The flash attachment works great. When you install it, you must push it down and turn the little wheel on the inside of the bend. Else, it would pop out on you. I almost missed that step because I never read instructions.

HDR and DRO settings are in the color settings instead of camera settings. Why? I have no idea. Maybe the Japanese have a different way of organizing things. I tried it and it just works like in the product description. However, the last shot seems to take a much longer time than the first 2 shots. Remember that and don't pull the camera until it finishes. I think there are times where it needs up to 6 shots.

I don't know what people are saying about controls. Yes it is finicky initially trying to figure out everything since not everything is labeled. But it literally took me about an hour to get used to the control. Some of it is redundant and I hope they fix that. Like the top dial and back dials sometimes serves the same function which is annoying. It's not the easiest interface but it's definitely easy to use if you just invest some time and learn. Or like me, just play around pushing every button and turning every dial. You cannot break the camera by pushing buttons!

Image quality is excellent. I feel as if my lack of skills was compensated by the camera's ability to take great pics. It does most of the thinking for you. Rule of thumb is to use Intelligent auto for regular shooting and superior for high contrast scenes. Or pick a scene selection mode and it'll always get the job done for you. Once you google photography basics and learn about aperture, shutter speed, iso and exposure. You can use the priority modes or manual once you get used to the controls.

I spent 2 hours in my room playing with this cam, doing firmware updates, going out to a pho restaurant and snapping a few pics to try out the features. Everything is just like it says or better. AF is fast and generally focus on what you want but you can always use the touch screen to have it focus on something else(like if you want to focus something on the edge of the screen and defocus the middle and background). NO EVF IS NOT A DEAL BREAKER! first, you already know it has none before you bought it. And then the naysayers complain about wanting EVF + flash. WTH, the LCD screen works just fine at night. And if you are a pro photographer then I ask you why are you using this camera? haters will always hate. Dumb people will always make dumb decisions.

Battery life definitely last way past the 330 rated shots for me. I took about 180 and my battery was at 75%. Maybe they meant 330 on raw + jpeg with flash and LCD on brightest outside in -20 weather. But maybe they are compensating for the battery over time. IDK but the battery lasting longer is a good thing, no complaints here.

I do have a few complaints. I hate the wifi and touch screen. Touch screen is pressure sensitive and not touch sensitive. I feel like i'm bending the screen sometimes because I actually am! Wifi is useless. Stick the card in your laptop and enjoy the UHS speed. Plus it doesn't drain your cam's battery. Or better yet, just plus the cam into your laptop and you can charge/transfer photos at the same time. Windows 7 automatically installed the camera btw, I didn't have to install anything except Playmemory software if you want to use it. I don't want more junk, I didn't bother with it. I have playmemory on my ipad2 and it works great transferring there through wifi but it's much slower. You know what? screw you apple! when are you going to have an SD slot?!?!?!

Turn on lens distortion correction in your settings!!! These lens are cheaper but they are ok. With the distortion correction, these lens should be excellent but don't expect it to be like $4000 professional hardware because it is not! Sony charged you an extra $100 over body only. What did you expect? a few Ferrari F430?

I like the size compared to the performance. It is pocketable body only but who does that? With a 16mm pancake lens, you can pocket it but why would you? You will have a better social life if you strap it around your neck(not waist! it's 2012!). It's light enough to not snap your spinal cord and big enough for people to notice and start a conversation with me. I was sitting there eating pho tinkering with this thing and a lot of people was looking at it(no i wasn't taking photos) Some even came to ask me about it because they did not know which to decide. Some just came to admire it because it is a very cool looking gadget. I will repeat this one more time. DO NOT POCKET THIS CAMERA! and DO NOT TAKE OUT THE LENS UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO PROTECT THE SENSOR!. Yes, i took the lens off and it is right there in the bare.

I did some research on the web and found that memory stick duos will be slightly faster than sd class 10. It will also produce less heat from the camera. If you have money to eat steak and eggs in the morning instead of a coffee and rice like me then go for it. I don't like Sony all that much to give in to their expensive crap. It cost about twice as much as the equivalent SD card from Sandisk.

READ THIS!! I have solved the slow recharge problems. Instead of using the brick sony included, I used the usb wire sony included and plugged it in my ipad's charger brick. It recharged my 5r from 11% to full in less than 2 hours.

Pros: Fast AF if you update the firmware. Excellent image quality even at high ISO. A lot of features. Will improve your social life if you don't pocket it. Better manual controls. Wifi for Ipads. Battery life exceeds expectations. Flip screen. Free flash.
Cons: wifi lacks speed. No support for UHS-1. Touchscreen is smash screen. Not pocketable. Nothing protecting sensor with lens off. Controls are sometimes redundant.

That said, these are great headphones for the price. I wear mine to the gym where there is loud music playing already, so I don't notice any lack of quality in the headphones there. Many people will look for in-ear headphones, possibly for size or comfort. I appreciate these in an additional way because my hearing ISN'T cut off from the rest of the world (contrary to what a lot of people want, so take that as you will). In the gym, again - where I primarily use them, it's handy to hear if somebody is calling my name for a spot, or if there's a PA announcement or something. I can easily hear that while still wearing my headphones. They also fold up rather well, and come with a bag to carry them in. The range is pretty good. I can leave my music player on a bench and go get weights from the other side of the gym without experiencing any interruption.
Some of the downsides not yet mentioned is that the main button is used for too many functions. You have to hold it down for a few seconds to turn it on, but hold it for slightly too long and it puts the device in searchable mode. This can be frustrating. Also, the plastic that goes around your ears can get uncomfortable after a time. Having a softer material or more configurable shape would be beneficial.

It is certainly thinner than my MZ-N707 but wider. The anterior half is metallic but the posterior is plastic. I find this esthetically pleasing to the eye to my surprise unlike the pictures on the website. It feels lighter than any portable I have and yet it feels solidly built.

CD-ROM Sonic Stage 2.0/MD Simple Burner

Optical Cable

Functions:

It does function as a removable drive. This was the clincher for me why I upgraded to Hi-MD. Good bye zip discs..... The transfer may not be as fast as a CD Burner but I still like the idea of the external protection of its casing. The method of writing I think is more reliable since it is a magneto-optical device. I was almost tempted to buy a Fujitsu MO drive because of the long wait for its released but instead I found myself buying a portable Toshiba DVD player instead. You can defragment using the windows XP's tool however the .hma files seem impervious to it. I always thought that you have to format the regular MDs to Hi-Mds first in order to use it as a storage device.

Suprisingly, once you drop any file to your sony hi-md removable drive, it automatically creates a management folder thus no intentional ""formatting"" required.

As a music device, for me it is far better than the NetMD. Transfer is a lot faster and the sounds better. Although I have used: Hi-SP and PCM using the sonic stage 2.1, the transfer seems flawless and much faster. Simple Burner transfer is easier to use however. The sound thus far is better than your LP2- 132kbps, but then again it is not fair to compare Hi-SP with LP2. The HD amp has so far delivered for me. The music is far clearer and life-like, in fact for me, music in MD is better than the CD maybe the HD amp plays a role in it. As far as display, the Hi-MD shows the title and the artist unlike NetMD.

The separation of each musical instrument is distinct enough, sensurround if you will, that you'll think the performance is right there in your room.

1) take picture
2) connect camera or memory card to computer
3) copy photos to computer
4) move photos from computer to sharing site, like Flickr or Facebook

New workflow with the Eye-Fi:
1) take picture

That's it. Eye-Fi automatically copies your picture to your computer and to your website.  The photos will be kept private until you make them public.

One downside to this is that your camera obviously must be powered on while the Eye-Fi handles steps 2-4 for you.  This may take 30-60 seconds, which may remind you of the old Polaroid days while you waited the minute for the picture to develop.  It runs the batteries down a bit faster, too, since you change your ""auto-off"" settings to give Eye-Fi time to do its thing.

Remember, too, it only works with a Wi-Fi network which you can configure.  So, Eye-Fi is connected to my home network, and when I'm home and take a picture, it functions as described above. If I'm out and about, the upload won't occur until I'm home and power up the camera again.  You know how you can go to a hotel and get a password at the desk to connect to their network?  You'll have to go in the Eye-Fi configuration and add the hotel settings there -- it's not enough to have your computer find the network, as the Eye-Fi operates independently.  (If this is an issue for you, buy the other Eye-Fi that works anywhere).

This is my first experience using Bluetooth technology so I didn't know what to expect and look for. I figured out the first one was defective when the blue light came on just a couple of times then not at all.

I received the replacement and the blue light came on and stayed on once plugged into the USB port. I can't believe how small it is. The software that came with it installed without any problems. It recognized my new Bluetooth mouse and printer and had them up and running within minutes. My OS is Windows XP SP3.

I had the adapter first installed in the front USB port of my PC to keep an eye on it during initial installation. I do need the front USB ports for other devices so I relocated the adapter to a port in the back of the PC. I was unsure of how that location would work out but it turned out not to be a problem at all. The mouse works perfectly fine and now I don't have to hassle with a cord getting tangled or caught.

I was really excited to see that it was a small package. I bought my mother a different headset last year and when it arrived it was huge. This headset is small enough - when it coils itself up - to fit into your pocket. It's really bendy and wraps into a pretzel when unworn. You could also wear it around the back of your neck. The coil is tight enough to stay on your head even when jogging. I like that it stays put when I push the treadmill up to 7 or 8. I always hated that when I wore wired earbuds, I could hear and feel the wire bouncing along as I ran. Sometimes the earbud would pop out after a while. I also like that after you get the earpads positioned comfortably, there's real bass. Not a little pitter patter, but a real boom. The forward and backward buttons are on the right ear (top and bottom buttons resepectively), the louder and quieter buttons are on the left ear (again top and bottom buttons respectively. The range for wearing the headset away from your mp3/bluetooth device is pretty good. At work, I leave my iPhone 4s on my desk and can go around the corner a good ways before I hear the beep. I wish I could remember the distance on the manual. They've lasted pretty durably and I'm glad for that as yet another headset I bought cracked at the wire after a year and now pinch the back of my neck. The one and only complaint I have is that the package only comes with 2 earpad sets. I lost 2 earpads, one of each size. It's been a real pain looking for a replacement set. I'm gonna try the bose eargels. Aside from that, I would CERTAINLY reccommend this product to anybody.
