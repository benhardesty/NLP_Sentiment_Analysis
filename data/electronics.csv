The time/date stamp function that it has (that can be turned off if wanted) is WONDERFUL! I wanted to get an in-depth look at the functionality of this camera before I got one, seeing as how on my budget, $199.00 is a LOT of money, and I wanted to be sure of what I was getting (I'm certain others can agree with me!) All I can say is, save up your money and get one! This camera is GREAT! (In fact, I think I'm going to get another one soon!) If you want to see the video I watched that helped me make up my mind to get this camera, look for a review for this camera on ""Youtube"" done by a person named ""Techmoan"". It convinced me, and not only is this camera small, and has a 2 1/2 to 3 hour battery life, it's also very light! When my ""Metroflash E360"" that I purchased here on Amazon.com 3 years ago, finally 'gave up the ghost', I got this camera to replace it, and didn't realize how much heavier the ""Metroflash"" had been (especially since I have it mounted on my bicycle helmet!) Also, I had thought my ""Metroflash"" had decent 'low-light' performance, the ""Drift Stealth 2"" even beat it in THAT respect! On a scale of 1-10, I'd give the video a 10, the audio a 9.3, (the only reason it loses .7 of a point, is because of a whistle from wind noise)  and the rain resistance a 10! (It can supposedly be submerged 2 meters [or 6.5 feet] without a waterproof case, but I haven't tried that, nor do I plan to!) I am planning on curing the wind whistle with a product sold here on Amazon.com, called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Micover-Stickover-Mini-Universal-Windscreen-for-DSLRs-Phones-Laptops-Small-Video-Cameras/dp/B006IWYH4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Micover Stickover-Mini Universal Windscreen for DSLRs, Phones, Laptops, Small Video Cameras</a>"" I'll see how it works. I just really enjoy the camera, and would not fail to recommend it to any/everyone!

(UPDATE 7-1-2015)
The ""Micover Stickover"" I mentioned in my review, is excellent for cutting out that pesky wind noise I was getting, (even though I only get up to 30mph, seeing as how I'm on a bicycle) and I would recommend it to anybody who wears this as a helmet-cam on a bicycle,(but can't speak for a motorcycle, or motocross racer).

For the curious, the case comes in two pieces: one piece screws to the tripod screw hole on the bottom of the camera and the second piece attaches to the bottom piece by 2-3 buttons. The buttons are very secure so you don't need to worry about it.

I think the red color makes this case very unique and is definitely for those who want to stand out. If not, get the black version. The leather, is of course, not real leather, but it feels just like it and protects the camera adequately. This won't protect the camera fully, for example, from rain or being dropped hard, so I'd suggest buying a camera bag or full-cover bag.

2957,3867,415498,415498,B00FEE7B1I,,5.0,"I had found that I did not use my 10"" android tablet at work as often as I thought I would.  It's a latest generation Samsung, and it's great, but it was too big for me to conveniently carry everywhere.  I checked, and most 8"" tablets would fit in my pants pocket.  I started looking, and I ordered this on a whim because Dell was selling a refurb for barely more than the cost of a Microsoft Office home and Student license (which is included).

It turns out I really like it a lot. I have barely used my larger (and much more expensive) tablet since I got this one.  I have read a lot of reviews from folks who have picked up an iPad mini or similar sized tablets who wind up preferring them to larger ones, and I will echo those thoughts.

Beyond the size, the reason I like it so much (again to my GREAT surprise) is Windows 8.1.  Really.  My family has two modern, powerful touch-screen laptops with Windows 8.1 on them.  I really don't like it in that application.  The ""metro"" (yes, I know that's not its real name, but it seems to be what folks still call it) touch screen interface is just horrible to me on a laptop.  I installed Classic Shell (which brings back the Start menu and boots to desktop mode) on my laptops, which really just about ""fixes"" what most folks hate about Windows 8.1. Still, sometimes you are forced into the metro screen, and it is still annoying.

BUT putting Windows 8.1 on a tablet changes everything.  The metro interface is clearly designed for tablet use, and it really shines there.  As much as I dislike the metro interface on the laptop, on the tablet, it is the desktop interface that is less satisfying.  The metro apps are fast, easy to use with fingers, and it is easy to switch between apps (all of those gestures, charms and swipes that are odd on a laptop now make perfect sense).  Web surfing, game playing and video watching are all as good as on any tablet I've used.  Having the built-in Word and Excel and the ability to run Windows programs are great bonuses (I even installed Civ 5 and played the touch-screen version. It's playable on this tablet, although the wait between turns is longer than on a modern full PC).

Even Internet Explorer (with one caveat) is a pleasure.  The swipe navigation is helpful, intuitive  and easy to use on a tablet.

Microsoft and Intel made some huge missteps in the launch of Windows 8 and windows tablets.  The first generation's Clover Trail atom processors were just not really up to the task of running a full desktop OS fluidly enough for many users.  The new Bay Trail atom processors are (no, they are not Haswell class, but they are not supposed to be that fast, either).

Having desktop and laptop users forced into a tablet desktop was also a terrible idea, but it sounds like Microsoft is finally realizing it.  The metro interface being run on a tablet with a powerful enough processor is great.  The Dell's screen is good, and is a pleasure to use.

Here are my nits, but none would deter me from recommending the tablet to a friend:

1.  The windows store is getting better, but it is far behind Google Play, much less Apple's app store in many areas.  I've been able to find an app for most of what I want to do, but the selection is nothing like the other ecosystems.

2. Here is the caveat for Internet Explorer.  Bing is integrated into the search feature.  Yes, you can go to the Google home page to run a search, but it's a pain and I wish Microsoft would let that thing go already.

Edit May 2, 2014:

I just was out of town and tried to use a capacitive stylus to annotate some PDF presentation slides.  You can't do that in the standard viewer app, but there are several apps available from the Windows store for relatively low cost.  I tried a couple, and unfortunately, I found it unworkable.  All I had was (a relatively good) capacitive stylus.  It was horrible.  It skipped so much as to make the annotations pointless.  I've ordered the new version of the active stylus from Amazon, but it's on back order.

I became disappointed with the Denon because it made the highs too shrill with its ""HIFI"" processing and felt underpowered. It seemed to encourage crisp clear sound and my hears found it unbalanced and unnatural. Strangely enough, I chose the Denon over other brands about a year ago because I felt it made my Pioneer speakers sound better.

I saw the 809 going for $410 on Amazon, so I jumped on it (paid $420 for the Denon 2112ci). Short story is the Onkyo is better hardware and sounds better. I am comparing apples to oranges though... the Onkyo 809 is in the same tier as the Denon 3112 (not the 2112), but the Onkyo same tier receivers are always cheaper than the Denons, where you can always get a higher tier Onkyo instead of a lower tier Denon. If you have cheaper speakers, you might be okay with a cheaper receiver (in fact, it might work better for you), but better speakers demand a better receiver.

The 809 is loaded with inputs, outputs, and features. It literally has everything you can think of. Preouts, second video output, saved settings per input, wide or height speakers, zone 2, and so on. The back of the receiver has over 3 times as many connections as the Denon (the Onkyo is a few inches higher and 2 times heavier).

The sound is very refined and high-end without the ""HIFI."" If you turn the volume up, you hardly get that pink audio noise, which was really loud on the Denon. Compared to the Denon, it has more refined sound - there are more details heard without jacking up the highs. The Onkyo has ""warmer"" sound than Denon, but is still dynamic, while the Denon has an ""overdrive"" sound.

The GUI is much better than the Denon's, but could still use some work. A nice feature is you are able to run the Auto Setup Calibration and then still change the EQ settings. Most receivers only allow manual or auto configuration. Audyssey XT works well. There is a newer release of the unit that has Audyssey XT32, but I felt that wasn't necessary for another $250.

Speakers play a more important part in sound and you need a receiver that goes well with them.

The cradle plugs into an A/C outlet (must be a 3-prong outlet). However, above the the 3 prongs on this Belkin product there is also a screw and then another plastic prong above the screw. What does this mean?
1. You can only plug this thing in on the bottom of dual plug wallplate
2. The screw on the cradle replaces the screw on your wallplate so you must remove 1 and attach the other. This makes this cradle a hassle to attach and remove and it's not exactly small enough to blend into the decor
3. The plastic prong takes up the ground plug of the top outlet, limiting your ability to use that outlet

To me, the whole thing is just very poorly thought out and is going straight to my ""things I'll never use again"" drawer. On the plus side - if you can get past the design flaws:

- you get surge protection with all 3 outlets and all are 3-pronged outlets

Also, once you start it back up, it won't let you go to anything but the ""Disc"" even if there is no disc in there you still have to wait while it looks for one.  And God forbid you actually have a disc in there, then you have to wait for it to play the disc,  and don't bother hitting ""eject"" because that won't work either.  And pressing any button on the remote just gives you a symbol that means ""NO"".  So your only choice every time you start this pile is to WAIT WAIT WAIT.  And YES that even includes if you have a disc in there and you just want to put a different disc in.  You cannot just hit the eject button, you have to turn on the power and let it start up the disc that is in there and then WAIT WAIT WAIT just to change the disc.

Junction View is shown prominently in Garmin advertisements for many GPSr's. It is deceptive advertising; it only works in a few, rare areas and Garmin won't tell you what those areas are.
Garmin on Junction View
<...>

Both searching the Garmin website and googling, it appears Garmin keeps Junction View locations a secret.  Calling and asking techs will get you varying answers as to how many areas it works in.

You can post Q&A on Garmin's and other forums and hope someone will confirm what areas work for you.  Once guy said it did work for parts of New York City....great.  I can confirm it does not work in Richmond, VA.

But then again I could be wrong about Richmond.  It appears Garmin's map updates can delete junction view.  JV has to be re-installed manually by downloading a file and mounting the GPS as a drive (i.e. the installer program uninstalls junction view, but doesn't install it back on).  Garmin does not provide this information on their Junction View page, you have to search the help files on the correct keywords you'll find that out.
<...>

The Amazon sales page should have a caveat in big letters highlighting that:
- Junction view, while given it's own prominent paragraph and picture in the advertisement, works only in a few small, select areas.
- Garmin keeps those areas a secret
- If it does work for you, updating your maps can delete junction view
Thus if junction view works in your area, you are lucky (and don't update your maps if you want to keep them)

If junction view does not work in your area, you need to:
- search the Garmin help files, find the write junction view file for your unit,
- follow directions to save them on your desktop.
- You will NOT use the map installer program to install the map files,
- Instead follow the directions to mount the GPS as a drive and manually insert files into correct location for your unit
- Note that the above just puts the files on your GPSr, junction view may not display in your area.

If junction view still doesn't work for you, it's either because
- you installed them wrong, or
- they don't work in your area
- the install process changed again
- you downloaded the wrong file

If it does pop up, just count yourself lucky and don't update your maps.",unit overall work well suitably reviewed purpose review warn junction view note different lane assist work junction view shown prominently garmin advertisement many gpsr deceptive advertising work rare area garmin tell area garmin junction view searching garmin website googling appears garmin keep junction view location secret calling asking tech get varying answer many area work post q garmin forum hope someone confirm area work guy said work part new york city great confirm work richmond va could wrong richmond appears garmin map update delete junction view jv installed manually downloading file mounting gps drive e installer program uninstalls junction view install back garmin provide information junction view page search help file correct keywords find amazon sale page caveat big letter highlighting junction view given prominent paragraph picture advertisement work small select area garmin keep area secret work updating map delete junction view thus junction view work area lucky update map want keep junction view work area need search garmin help file find write junction view file unit follow direction save desktop use map installer program install map file instead follow direction mount gps drive manually insert file correct location unit note put file gpsr junction view may display area junction view still work either installed wrong work area install process changed downloaded wrong file pop count lucky update map,"06 1, 2011",A2WL88J22CRY6O,Wayne,{'Product Packaging:': ' Standard Packaging'},"Unit good, Junction View does not work",1306886400,False,3,0

High Def:
The 1080P simulated image from this projector is incredible. You can't tell the extra pixels aren't there. The actual image looks very film like. If you stand 1 foot from the screen you can see a screen door, but no one watched movies that close. I typically sit 7-10 feet back and the picture is perfect. Switching between a high def signal and a standard def signal takes this projector several seconds. This is annoying. Yes, you think you will only watch high def. Well many menus are not high def, so if you go to a cable box menu to choose something to watch you have to wait several seconds with no screen. Then after you choose something, you have to wait several more seconds to go back.

3D:
It is an absolute pain in the butt to turn on and off 3D. I use my FIOS On Demand to watch free HBO 3D movies. First you have to go to the very last configuration menu, then the last option for advanced, then the last option for 3d, then you have to choose the first option to turn it on. then the menus completely exit automatically (Other menu selections don't exit). However after turning on 3d you have to go back to that same exact menu to select side by side. This doesn't exit automatically so you now press the menu button several times to exit. To turn 3d off, you have to reverse the process.

However, 3D does work great. And you don't need a PC or a special box. All you need to do is get some DLP-Link compatible glasses. I got these because they have such great reviews:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate3DHeaven-Ultra-Clear-DLP-Link-compatible-3D-Glasses/dp/B004RBV2J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate3DHeaven Ultra-Clear DLP Link compatible 3D Glasses</a>. Thats it. 3d glasses, this projector and something which offers 3d, like FIOS or a 3d blu ray player. The 2D to 3D is ok, but its not real 3d. Some things pop out nicely but its not quite the same. I don't know if its worth the headache. But to turn on 2d-3d conversion, you just need to press 1 button on the remote. go figure.

Pros: Great image although the native resolution is lower than 720P. You probably won't be able to tell.
Low price on a projector that has the latest 3d technology in it and the only 2d-3d projector I can find.
Light weight if you are a travelling type.
3d built in. Many budget projectors require the purchase of a separate converter or a PC.
Turns off quickly. About 5 seconds.

Menus and interface are poorly written

Most you can decide if you want it to alarm or just display on the screen, but some (civil emergencies, nuclear emergencies, tornado and hurricane warnings) you can't adjust - they will make noise.

268,20,106259,106259,B002COJEOU,,3.0,"This is a pretty cool router - not only wireless connectivity but also with a hard drive (which is *not* included, please note!) that can be shared for storage and USB ports for sharing other devices.  It also has the picture frame feature which is kind of a nice (if a bit odd) addition.  But unfortunately, it's not exactly plug & play.

I'm not an IT guy but I got my MBA with an emphasis in Information Systems and I've handled the IT needs for small companies I've worked for (outsourcing the tougher stuff), but all that's been a few years ago and I really haven't needed to keep up on technology much since then.  So, while I'm not an expert I probably know just enough to get myself into trouble.  I've installed other wireless home routers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Link-DIR-825-Xtreme-N-Dual-Band/dp/B001F7HLRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D-Link DIR-825 Xtreme N Dual Band</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Linksys-WRT54G/dp/B00007KDVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Linksys WRT54G</a>) and they were almost plug & play.  Unfortunately, this one didn't go as smoothly.

We have broadband access through our cable provider and it was difficult to get this router to work with it, but working through the setup process on the computer solved the initial connectivity problems.  The picture frame is a nice extra feature, but the screen is so small that it seems almost pointless.  The FrameChannel option makes good use of it, though, and you can subscribe to weather, news, comics, etc., as well as have your own photos cycling.  The weather and photos were the only really worthwhile options to me, however, as the comics I selected ended up so small they couldn't be read and the news wasn't local (tons of options but nothing relevant to me).  But at least it allows you to keep the router on top of the desk or otherwise out in the open, although it didn't have as good of range as we had before (we placed the other routers *under* the desk and still got much better range).

My biggest complaint is with staying connected to the internet.  We continually had problems both on the desktop computer connected directly to the router as well as connecting wirelessly with the laptop - and sometimes one would work and the other wouldn't.  The internet would randomly drop off and later come back online, and the speed on the wireless connection was inconsistent - usually extremely fast but sometimes excruciatingly slow.  I'm sure a much more savvy computer-person than myself could have figured out the problems but after my wife got angry I switched back to our&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Link-DIR-825-router/dp/B001F7HLRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D-Link DIR-825 router</a>&nbsp;(only took 5 minutes after I found the right cords) and we haven't had a problem since.

It was run from switching equipment through a hole in the floor, across a plenum, and back up through a hole in the floor to a computer. After hooking it up, video was working fine with no noticeable loss, however I wasn't getting any audio across the cable. Thinking maybe there was an issue at the switching equipment or the computer, I troubleshooted the cable by plugging it directly into an audio source at one end and a known-working set of amplified speaker at another. No dice.

Unfortunately, I was in a bit of a pinch for time, so I didn't have time to send it back for exchange. Luckily I did have the ability to send audio over CAT-5 for the job, which I did to rectify the issue. But the issue remains that video works, audio does not.

2991,1977,630982,630982,B016ZOCE8K,,5.0,"The D-Scope V2 is easily one of the best cheap VR / Cardboard solutions on the market. Here's a quick guide:

Pros:

-Easy setup. Slide the D-scope out of its protective sleeve, follow the on-box instructions. This basically consists of removing a hook-and-loop fastener, folding a piece back, inserting your phone, and replacing the fastener. Extremely easy.

-Everything included. For those who don't know, Google Cardboard uses a standardized QR Code to import settings necessary to configure your phone to work with each VR headset. Many factors influence

-Excellent kit. The lenses are large, and unlike the v1 setup are better mounted for clearer visibility. This setup is as good as it gets for Google Cardboard. There's even an included magnetic ""button"", which works out of the box on most phones to help you interact with most apps without having to reach into the viewer.

-Yes, it has a ""Grease patch"". Many people complain that Cardboard kits need a piece of tape over the nose piece to keep people's greasy faces from ruining the cardboard. This kit comes standard with that piece of tape, which can easily be refreshed with any roll of household packing tape.

-I got my D-scope up and running, including downloading and setting up apps, inside of ten minutes. Fast and simple.

Cons:

-You will almost certainly have to pull your phone out of any protective case to use it in the D-Scope, as it expects a very slim phone. Nearly all modern phones will fit in the range of screen size 4-6"". My MotoG 2014 fits perfectly. But do check the listed dimensions.

-Not everyone can use 3d headset. I'll give more detail below.

Common pitfalls:

-A significant portion of the population don't see 3d ""correctly"". Even if you navigate your daily life just fine, there are a lot of fine problems that could affect your ability to see VR, which only your eye doctor can diagnose. For example, a good portion of the population have eyesight where one eye is dominant over the other. In daily life, this has no effect whatsoever on your vision. But when you use VR headsets, the designers assume your eyes are equally dominant. This means people with perfectly fine vision will be unable to use a VR headset like this, they'll have double vision or blurriness using the VR headset. If you've followed all the instructions and still can't see your Cardboard correctly, talk about it with an optometrist.

-But some people can train their eyes! I personally had an issue where my eyes change dominance, rarely ever meeting in the happy middle that VR headsets expect. With some training using online 3d eye tests, I was able to examine this issue, and now once I put on my D-scope I just need to take a few seconds to calm my eyes and I see the 3d just fine. Search around, the medical field is still catching up and there's an astonishing lack of good information out there.

-To troubleshoot your settings, use the Google Cardboard profiler, and you need to know your pupillary distance (or inter-pupillary distance, PD, which you can obtain for free from any optometrist by request). My personal PD is 62, when most VR systems cater to the ""normal"" range of 50-55mm, and Google Cardboard generally caters up to 60mm. This means I cannot use most 3d glasses, they just aren't built for my eyes. Using the D-Scope still isn't perfect, but Google has an online profiler that can generate a new QR code that I can use to dial in my settings. Just do a Google search for Google Cardboard profiler, and follow the instructions to dial in your settings.

-And yes, you have to download and set up VR apps to use the headset. The VR industry is still very new, so none of this is ""plug and play"" yet.

So overall, the D-Scope v2 is one of the best solutions on the market. It's cheap, it's durable, the lenses are great. The magnetic button works beautifully, the provided QR codes for setup and additional apps work.

Firstly, these are super light and have a perfect fit. There are no gaps behind or below the ears. My big ears fit easily inside each cup with no compression. With some styles of headphones, the tension is great enough to give me a headache. These are snug enough to maintain a seal, but not tight enough to give me any discomfort.

The audible cues are clear and concise with power on and connecting. They connect very fast to devices. The firmware update process is painless and very quick (updated multiple minor versions in less than 5 minutes). The sound quality is second to none: deep bass with crisp highs. The sound dampening is very effective (I didn't hear my alarm go off and I didn't even have the volume up all the way). The microphone works very well with phone calls, Facetime, and WebEx without picking up ambient noise.

There are only a few drawbacks, but they're easily mutable. For one, when connected to two devices, sometimes the audio will get choppy. Bose is aware of the issue and is addressing it with firmware updates in the near future. There's an easy fix for it for now which is to simply disconnect from one of the devices and the sound quality returns to normal. The other issue I've noticed is the headphones show up with two outputs on my computer, which has caused issues initially with WebEx not choosing the correct output by default. Once you set that manually, it sticks.

The device comes well-boxed with a car charger (cigarette lighter with a long, long cable (about 4 feet) to micro USB), a regular micro USB cable for your computer, a suction cup, and that's about it. It's a very through-the-motions packaging experience. Nothing fancy, and the camera itself is a little plastic-y. The buttons on the camera have a very satisfying click to them, and my sample's regular LCD screen looked just fine (if not HD), with no stuck/dead pixels or other screen anomalies.

Setup was a little trickier than I'd have liked, - it's not a touch screen, and the button layout is not instinctively intuitive. Once you have it set up (date/time etc), it all becomes a lot simpler as you'll likely just be hitting the record button.

Getting a micro SD card into the unit took a bit of finagling. I ended up using a credit card to push it in all the way as I don't really have any nails to speak of. In a positive sense, at least it won't be popping out by mistake!

Image quality is actually quite decent. There's a slight fish-bowl look to things, a result of the extremely wide lens in there to capture everything very close in front of you (in the event of a collision, for example). Cars come out pretty well defined, and you'd have no trouble reading license plates when the car in front is reasonably close to you. This is important, so I'm glad it works.

Curiously, while you can zoom in and out, you cannot do this while the camera is recording. However, to be fair, it's just a digital zoom (there's no physical lens movement that I can tell), so you don't gain any extra detail by zooming in anyway. If you have some basic editing tools at home, you can always zoom in as necessary, after the fact.

The GSHOCK option in the camera menu I found quite interesting. You can set it to low, medium, or high sensitivity, and the camera will record if it detects any sudden shock to the device. This could be particularly handy if someone crashes into you when you're parked, although if they ram the back of your car, you might well be wishing you had another camera in the back window! At the highest sensitivity (my recommendation), it did a pretty decent job when I tapped the camera mount itself - starting recording immediately, though I'll wait till someone reverses into my car to test that feature out extensively!

There are a few software quirks (e.g. to turn the device off you have to hold down the power button for a second or two... and then let go. If you don't let go, it never actually turns off! Weird), and the interface definitely takes a little getting used to, but, you know.., the Esky 2.4"" Full HD car camera does a pretty decent job - doing basically what it sets out to do, and it works.

Overall, 4 out of 5. Certainly recommended for those in need of a dash-cam fix!

1348,8307,9168,9168,B00006B8DA,,4.0,"This is a very sturdy and ruggedly built KVM switch from Startech that for the most part delivers what it advertises. First, I do not have any monitors that go above 1080, so I have no way of testing higher resolutions. I am pretty sure that there is an upper limit to what resolution can be obtained from a simple VGA connection though. If you need higher resolution, you would be better off looking for a KVM switch that supports HDMI connections, not VGA.

I was a bit disappointed when I opened the box and found that there were not only no cables (not that they were promised) but no 5V power supply either. I often build and repair my own computers, so I had plenty of 5V adapters laying around. They aren't exactly difficult to find online for cheap, either. However, as it turns out, I have yet to run into a situation where I actually needed to plug-in a power supply. The switch works fine without it on the two Windows and one Linux workstation I have running on the device. Perhaps if you are using the included USB hub to power some external devices you may run into trouble, but for everyday use I have not needed to use a power supply yet. All of the buttons light up fine and the unit seems to work well without one.

Another slight annoyance was the polarity of the KVM cables needed to link between computers and the switch. I had an entire box full of older KVM cables that I thought I would be able to use. It turns out that they are incompatible with this model though. I was able to solve the problem by ordering a handful of VGA gender changer adapters. It would be nice if KVM manufacturers stuck to some sort of standardization though. The previous 3 KVM switches I owned all worked fine with the KVM cables that I already owned.

I absolutely love this receiver, and it is a must have over the factory radio. The bluetooth connectivity is easy and lightning fast. The sound using Pandora, HD Radio, and Bluetooth streaming is CD quality. SiriusXM is, well, SiriusXM - very compressed and a tad bit muffled, but that is not the receiver's fault. The SiriusXM tuner is required if you decide to add that on. All of the above will generally display the album art, and that's pretty cool. DVD video and sound quality are fabulous.
My only knock on this radio is really not so much on the radio. It is with Pioneer and the AppRadio One app for Android that will not connect with the Samsung Galaxy S6. It is very well documented online that it will only work with iPhone and a handful of Android phones, and Pioneer has dropped the ball, particularly with a top-of-the-line smartphone like the S7. I would love to have the functionality that, quite honestly, I expected when I purchased the receiver.

-simple set up
-great sound quality
-solid talk and standby time
-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options
-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)

I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:

-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.
-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking ""talk me off speaker phone"", and I have to explain to them that I can't.

Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.

One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a ""soft phone"" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.

These offer a balanced sound, meaning the bass is there without taking away from the rest of the sound spectrum. If you want earth shattering, look elsewhere. The most impressive thing about these IEMs for me is the clarity of the sound. I feel like I'm hearing the music the way the artist intended it to be heard.

This player is great for the 98% of us!  Folks...don't forget we're talking a sub-$100 unit here!  It's a huge step up from my 3 year old LG that broke.  It is ultra quiet mechanically, picture quality impeccable on DVD and BD, and the streaming stuff, too.  Setup went flawless on wireless (router is nearby to be fair).  I don't see why some people fuss over the menu system, which is serviceable and complete, with the Gracenote info a nice plus, like my PS3 was.  The SEN network seems sorta not well blended in, as are the Opera Store apps, so the player seems a little like it has a case of multiple personality disorder!

The radio also has a light button that when pushed lights up the station/time view area for a few seconds.  The view area always displays the radio station, but when the time button is pressed the time is displayed for a few seconds and then reverts back to the station frequency.

The colors are initially a little washed out from out of the box, but futzing with the settings produced a picture that I would consider optimal for competitive gaming (using DVI so far), along with the very low 2ms response time of the panel, it would serve any starting gamer with the best product for the money. My mother is using this for more screen space for work in her home office, which has passed with flying colors in her initial tests (web browsing, sorting through pictures, writing up product descriptions, publishing websites, etc.).

Pros:
Wide selection of inputs for 1080p sources
Very quick and easy setup out of the box (throw out the disk, you won't need it)
Well packaged and secure within the box
Included DVI-D and VGA cables in the box
Great response time
Relatively cheap for a good quality panel
Matte screen

Cons:
Colors are still a little washed out after messing with settings
Audio is horrible on the built-in speakers
Very shiny, fingerprint prone bezel (easily fixed with a quick wipe-down)

All issues were solved with this new N900 Router, even though setup FOR ME was tough because we have an old Vonage router that I have to keep and the instructions were terrible regarding setup with other routers (doesn't really say anything about it, they just assume it's your only router).

So, I went to advanced settings, device mode and chose ""Extender Mode"" which just makes it a wireless access point.  And I went the Advanced LAN settings and turned OFF DHCP, which is the service to assign IP addresses, which the Vonage router already does, and since it's first in line after the cable modem, it's best to let it do that.  Also, in ""Extender Mode"" DO NOT connect this to your other router in the N900 yellow internet port!  Use one of the regular ethernet ports!  They don't tell you this but you will have nothing but problems if you do.  I also had to change the N900's IP address to 192.168.1.101 instead of the default, which is already my Vonage router's address in my LAN. (in the HOST LAN settings screen, LAN IP address ""address of the router on the network"")

I own Macbook Pros which I use consistently as well as Windows laptops. When I saw this for the price that I mentioned above I could not resist it! In a nutshell I can truly say that I really like this little Hisense Chromebook. To me it works as fast as my Macbook Pro and maybe a little bit faster! Heck I now use this Chromebook more than I use my Macbook Pro! This thing boots up quickly and you can get right to surfing the internet as soon as possible without a delay.

This little Chromebook is nothing like the Windows netbooks which were the exact same size that I bought just a couple of years ago who would eventually get slow and laggy. This is a browser laptop that works!....and gets the job done for what your trying to do. If it's just surfing the internet or watching videos on Youtube it does what its suppose do and does it right. I didn't think I would like these little Chromebooks, but I can honestly admit I was totally wrong.

This would be the perfect present for someone who cannot afford to buy a computer to use for surfing the internet, or for someone who may own an older laptop/desktop that has began to run at a snails pace but they just don't have the money to buy a new one in this tough economy. Or it can be for someone who may not be so tech savvy such as some Spouses, Grandparents, Parents, in-laws, or that not too tech savvy Uncle, Aunt or cousin who wants to just get the internet for basic purposes.

**UPDATE** 8-2-2016

I had given the Hisense Chromebook to someone who needed a computer. I missed my Hisense Chromebook so much to the point that I just ordered another one, it only cost $84.00, and I just received it a couple of days ago...Let me tell you I am so Happy to have my Hisense Chromebook back with me.  I also wanted to mention that after I bought the first Hisense Chromebook I managed to purchase two more Chromebooks refurbished (Groupon) which is the Acer CB5-571-c4g4 and the Acer CB3-571-c4a5 and that shows how much i've grown to really like Chromebooks. They are both 15.6"" and the perfect size but just like I said I had to repurchase my beloved Hisense Chromebook that I like to use when i'm laying in bed when I don't feel like using my tablets and other laptops. The Hisense Chromebook is truly an EXCELLENT bang for your buck and I never thought that I would say that before I bought the first Hisense Chromebook, and I truly mean that!...Try a Hisense Chromebook for yourself and you will see exactly what I mean.

I added another one to my personal arsenal - The newest addition gets bumped down a star - Still a good C Stand but there are some noticeable differences in quality (nothing major, but still enough to warrant an update) - The newest one is a tad heavier (by 3.5 lbs) which isn't a big deal to me, and may or may not matter to you either, but worth a mention none the less;
The gobo head does not tighten as securely around the extension arm as the first stand. It holds a firm grip but the gap is evident. I compared it with the first gobo and swapped arms, measured and it's obvious that the new gobo was machined a little off calibration wise. This stand didn't come 'assembled' either - also not a big deal but the first stand was prime eligible and arrived assembled in 2 days with free shipping - Which brings me to the last mediocre 'con' - No prime shipping, UPS Ground, pricey and SLOW - Size warrants a bulky box, and bulky box will probably arrive bruised and crushed since the C Stand only takes up 1/4 of the box, making the parcel vulnerable to being crushed from top (which isn't going to damage the stand but still an issue as far as shipping woes)
Still a good stand, just not as friendly on the budget after $30 shipping, lag time, no prime eligibility, etc, I probably should of just spent a few extra bucks and got a Kupo, Matthews, etc - 4 out of 5 stars - Shop around or spend the extra coin and get a name brand with prime.

Great high quality C Stand here! One of the many downsides of photography and film is that it is def not a poor man's hobby as most people quickly learn as they expand their equipment. This is more of a myth these days as lighting kits and equipment become cheaper in price and more accessible to the amateur. The common problem is the cheaper the price, the cheaper the quality.

Not the case here.

This C Stand is just as good as my Matthews, and 1/2 the price. The rubber grip is an added bonus too. Solidly built, it is holding up just fine. I was a bit leery of buying this at first, as I have had the usual woes with cheap plastic stands, but this is by no means a cheaply built product. Does the job great, folds easy for storage and it compliments my name brand in both durability and quality.

My only advice would be to shop around. The price fluctuates on these, and while I feel I got a great price, if I can save even more $$ I will.

1576,5224,77857,77857,B000WY8JRU,,5.0,"USAGE:

I'm part of a group of about 30 people who all use these, typically all on the same channel. At times we're spread throughout the woods, usually in varying terrain (hills/mountains/thick woods/brush), and sometimes flat-lands.. areas as large as 120 acres. We've been using these radios for over a year now with scarcely an issue with being able to hear each-other loud and clear.

They are secure, reliable, and easy to use!

I'll keep my review short, because there's lots of folks who've exhaustingly posted up about these radios. I'd give these a 10 if I could, instead I can only give a 5/5!

PROS:

* Too many good things to mention!

* Outperforms standard FRS systems - Our group uses them in mixed terrain, flatlands to mountains to trenches, heavy woods.. 50..70..120 acres, no issue

* Secure, unlike standard FRS--even secure against the same model radio, thanks to encryption

* Private and Public channels, IE you can address everyone on the same line, or you can address a specific radio

* You can tx/rx text messages if you like, to all, a group, or individuals

* The kit includes everything you need to get started, including some basic headsets

* The radios will accept higher-end headsets!

* Can use alkaline batteries, excellent for when the rechargables die

* There is a cloning feature built into the radios, so you can clone the settings and the addressbook, or just the settings. This is great if you have particular settings/channels you need to program into say, 50 radios at once, like our group! Set one radio up, and clone the rest off of it!

* You won't find a better deal on license-free radios, for this price range, ANYWHERE. We have folks in our group who deal in the radio business, and at wholesale pricing, and for the under $80 range for a whole setup, you can't beat these

* Amazon Prime has had the best price on these for awhile, I got mine for $67 shipped. That's less than $38 per radio, including headset and battery

CONS:

* If I had to list a con, I'd say some folks don't like the included headset because it pinches their ears

* Some folks don't like the rechargable batteries because they don't last a solid 8 hours

* NOT WATERPROOF BY ANY STRETCH, not even water-resistant! That's one thing most of my other FRS radios can claim: being water proof. These are not. I've had to take a couple apart to get grease and other stuff out from under the keypad. So ensure you keep these in a pouch of some sort, or under your clothing!

SYNCH ISSUES:

A few years back, this model radio had re-synch issues.. no longer!

BATTERIES:

Half of us use the rechargable batteries, the rest of us use alkalines. The rechargables will work for about 4-6 hours of constant use, depending on weather variables. Alkaline batteries tend to last a full 8 hours.

1 - My customer support experience was positive: I initially thought a button that was difficult to press had broken and contacted customer support.  They were quick to respond although I eventually figured out how to work with the product.  My issue happens when the unit completely discharged (which happens in around 4 hours of use).  If you purchase the unit I would suggest you charge it after an hour or so of use.

2 - Some have discussed a gap that is created by the unit when placed on the side of your head.  After several months of use as shown in the pictures, I began to have some jaw issues - have no idea if the problem was related to the swimp3, but once you're used to this thing you will not want to swim without it, so I moved it to the back of my head while I swim.  That's the nice thing about bone conduction - doesn't have to be anywhere near your aural canal.  I hear it just fine mounted to the middle of the back of my head.  That should take care of all but the pickiest goggles.  I would say that it's hard to use on thin-strapped goggles...I use a triathlon goggle with thicker straps which has been great.

This is the second extension cable from 2 different sellers, brands I have bought on Amazon. My Microsoft webcam worked perfect in windows 7 and 8 solo and with the cable.
In the past using a HP computer 8.1, the cables did not work. Video shows how it looked in the past before this problem was fixed. I tried everything and still did not work until recently.

Now in Jan, 2015 I bought a different brand of computer with newest 8.1, did a few uninstall, reinstall; Now the cable works and the video is perfect! I can use the webcam, cable with HD highest resolution... and is nice and clear, fast.

It also works very well for audio using a old mic I bought at the thrift store or any mic.

Also; trying different ports to plug in the cable helped and it seems Microsoft updated the cord software, driver.

So; if you get the problem I show in the video; try a few different setups, upgrades... There is something new out there that fixed this problem. Or I 'aint too computer savvy' and missed something in the past.",div id video block r p ue uflvry class section spacing small spacing top mini video block div input type hidden name value http image na ssl image amazon com image b dgy wtqs mp class video url input type hidden name value http image na ssl image amazon com image e bxgsww png class video slate img url nbsp updated review star second extension cable different seller brand bought amazon microsoft webcam worked perfect window solo cable past using hp computer cable work video show looked past problem fixed tried everything still work recently jan bought different brand computer newest uninstall reinstall cable work video perfect use webcam cable hd highest resolution nice clear fast also work well audio using old mic bought thrift store mic also trying different port plug cable helped seems microsoft updated cord software driver get problem show video try different setup upgrade something new fixed problem aint computer savvy missed something past,"04 8, 2014",A9ARVDAUZEHDM,Mary I.

561,9386,254262,254262,B005LKB0IU,,4.0,"Pre-disclosure: I'm a bit of an audiophile. The sound quality on these are not the best ever. With a good device (with an EQ) you can get some decent sound out of them.
That said, these are great headphones for the price. I wear mine to the gym where there is loud music playing already, so I don't notice any lack of quality in the headphones there. Many people will look for in-ear headphones, possibly for size or comfort. I appreciate these in an additional way because my hearing ISN'T cut off from the rest of the world (contrary to what a lot of people want, so take that as you will). In the gym, again - where I primarily use them, it's handy to hear if somebody is calling my name for a spot, or if there's a PA announcement or something. I can easily hear that while still wearing my headphones. They also fold up rather well, and come with a bag to carry them in. The range is pretty good. I can leave my music player on a bench and go get weights from the other side of the gym without experiencing any interruption.
Some of the downsides not yet mentioned is that the main button is used for too many functions. You have to hold it down for a few seconds to turn it on, but hold it for slightly too long and it puts the device in searchable mode. This can be frustrating. Also, the plastic that goes around your ears can get uncomfortable after a time. Having a softer material or more configurable shape would be beneficial.

Once I got this replaced, the new control pod had a defective male plug (the one that goes into the back of your computer) and results in a loud buzzing unless the plug cable is pulled at the perfect angle. Additionally I also get random sound distortion for half a second at a time while I am listening to anything on these speakers.

So far as good things go. My roommate has had these speakers for months and had no problems with them. His work perfectly. When they are working, these speakers are really nice! The highs are fairly crisp, although the lows do have some distortion when the bass is pushed too far. By that, I mean that you sometimes need to put it lower than the recommended setting (which is only about 1/5 of the potential bass) in order to avoid some lows that are not meant to go through the bass from bleeding through. It can make the low male voices in some movies, or music sound a lot more muddy than it should be. Fortunately, this is generally the case when listening to stuff on a very loud volume setting.

I would probably raise my review a star if my speakers had worked as well as my roommates. This is a great system for the price, but you are gambling on getting a good one, or a bad egg.. and from what I have read (after reading a lot of reviews on here I realized that people never really give their products time to have problems before they post a perfect review) on forums, etc. the volume control pod is a major issue ($20 replacement) and you should expect to have to replace it a minimum of one time if you are going to purchase these speakers.

Update 12/12/2013:
I am still using these speakers and still hold a soft spot in my heart for them. However, I would like to make an additional comment about a problem that I had overlooked when originally writing this review. The sound quality is great, but these speakers are incapable of low volume via the knobs on the front of the speaker. If you try to turn the knob below about 20% you'll hear some pretty distorted sound and it will only come out of one speaker (Mine's the left) My roommate has had the same problem and after speaking with another friend that happened to have these speakers he has experienced the same thing. This isn't a horrible issue as you can always change the sound on the computer itself and it won't impact the sound quality, but it's a definite design flaw that is really irritating if you just like to use the hardware to change your sound settings. Aside from that, I am still loving these speakers.",set computer speaker love speaker audio enthusiast spend lot time upgrading computer home car sound system hobby really wanted like speaker roommate worked perfectly six seven month duration unfortunately case mine ordered speaker roughly month ago since time one two control pod significant problem first one immediately inoperable touched volume dial would distort sound make volume randomly change either full volume heard speaker loud volume got replaced new control pod defective male plug one go back computer result loud buzzing unless plug cable pulled perfect angle additionally also get random sound distortion half second time listening anything speaker far good thing go roommate speaker month problem work perfectly working speaker really nice high fairly crisp although low distortion bass pushed far mean sometimes need put lower recommended setting potential bass order avoid low meant go bass bleeding make low male voice movie music sound lot muddy fortunately generally case listening stuff loud volume setting would probably raise review star speaker worked well roommate great system price gambling getting good one bad egg read reading lot review realized people never really give product time problem post perfect review forum etc volume control pod major issue replacement expect replace minimum one time going purchase speaker update still using speaker still hold soft spot heart however would like make additional comment problem overlooked originally writing review sound quality great speaker incapable low volume via knob front speaker try turn knob hear pretty distorted sound come one speaker mine left roommate problem speaking another friend happened speaker experienced thing horrible issue always change sound computer impact sound quality definite design flaw really irritating like use hardware change sound setting aside still loving speaker,"10 12, 2011",ADY1E4CAPP1W1,LopsidedMidget,{'Size:': ' 3-piece'},Whether they are working or not is a gamble.,1318377600,True,4,0

This is my first experience using Bluetooth technology so I didn't know what to expect and look for. I figured out the first one was defective when the blue light came on just a couple of times then not at all.

I received the replacement and the blue light came on and stayed on once plugged into the USB port. I can't believe how small it is. The software that came with it installed without any problems. It recognized my new Bluetooth mouse and printer and had them up and running within minutes. My OS is Windows XP SP3.

I had the adapter first installed in the front USB port of my PC to keep an eye on it during initial installation. I do need the front USB ports for other devices so I relocated the adapter to a port in the back of the PC. I was unsure of how that location would work out but it turned out not to be a problem at all. The mouse works perfectly fine and now I don't have to hassle with a cord getting tangled or caught.

This is the second TV I have wall mounted, the first being over ten years ago when the process was a lot more difficult and when TV's were a lot heavier.  This was a much easier mounting process that required only minimal mechanical skill and tools, although I would still suggest having a partner.
This is also a VESA mount.  VESA is an organization that provides uniformity standards for the different brands of consumer electronics to comply with, which as far as mounts go, means that most major TV brands will have similar mounting set-ups so the process and equipment used for mounting will be standard, or 'VESA compliant'.

2412,4248,179053,179053,B0062D4IHA,,3.0,"I'm a little disappointed in this item. It's probably partly my fault because at $13.00 I wouldn't have normally been expecting much, but since it said it was marked down from the regular price of $25.00, I thought maybe it would be OK. I have two problems with it.

1. This has been mentioned before, but in portrait mode, This case doesn't really provide much support. In the first position, with the Fire standing nearly upright, it almost always collapses and just falls backward. At the middle position, it seems to work OK as long as you're not doing much with the touch screen. If all you're doing is reading and touching it lightly to flip pages, it might be alright, but when pressing in a way that I consider normal, like tapping on the screen to open an app, or swiping with your finger is likely to make it collapse. I haven't tried the third setting with the fire positioned at about 25 to 30 degrees might work OK, but I'm not likely to use it in that position very often.

It seems to work a little better in the horizontal position because the side edge is making more contact with the case than in the vertical position.

The most obvious problem I see is that the raised strips in the cover that are trying to support the device and the edge of the case the Fire fits in that catches the raised edges just don't have enough contact with each other to keep the device secure. Maybe if the raised portion was higher, or there was some kind of small lip for the edge of the device case to catch it would work better, but as it is, there isn't much there to keep it from slipping off and collapsing when you tap, or swipe your finger on the touch screen.
I think I can make this work okay by using a little velcro on the raised strips and the edge of the Fire's case, so I'll probably keep it and play with making it work.

2. The description I read said that this is a leather case. I may be wrong, but I've been using leather accessories for a long time and if this is leather, it's not a leather from any animal I'm familiar with. It smells like something that is definitely man made and is actually fairly thin. I know, at $13.00 I'm being a little nit picky, but if the description says leather I expect it to smell like leather and not plastic.

On the plus side, it does have an elastic strap you can pull over the cover that keeps it closed securely.

I purchased this because there is only one other case I've seen that allows you to use the Fire in either the vertical, or horizontal position and I use both my phone and the Fire in each position a fairly equal amount of time, depending on what I'm using it for at the time.

Perhaps we'll have a better choice in cases once the Fire has been out for a while. As many Fire's as Amazon is selling, I would expect to see a lot more cases coming out and I'd recommend waiting for something that's designed and made a little better with better material. You might also look at cases for the 7"" Samsung Galaxy Tab, or the Blackberry Rim since they're the same size.

I'm giving this 3 stars, mainly because I do like the snap that allows me to swivel the Fire from horizontal to vertical, but the quality isn't that great and I'm going to have to make some modifications to make it work without collapsing when using the touch screen.",little disappointed item probably partly fault normally expecting much since said marked regular price thought maybe would ok two problem mentioned portrait mode case really provide much support first position fire standing nearly upright almost always collapse fall backward middle position seems work ok long much touch screen reading touching lightly flip page might alright pressing way consider normal like tapping screen open app swiping finger likely make collapse tried third setting fire positioned degree might work ok likely use position often seems work little better horizontal position side edge making contact case vertical position obvious problem see raised strip cover trying support device edge case fire fit catch raised edge enough contact keep device secure maybe raised portion higher kind small lip edge device case catch would work better much keep slipping collapsing tap swipe finger touch screen think make work okay using little velcro raised strip edge fire case probably keep play making work description read said leather case may wrong using leather accessory long time leather leather animal familiar smell like something definitely man made actually fairly thin know little nit picky description say leather expect smell like leather plastic plus side elastic strap pull cover keep closed securely purchased one case seen allows use fire either vertical horizontal position use phone fire position fairly equal amount time depending using time perhaps better choice case fire many fire amazon selling would expect see lot case coming recommend waiting something designed made little better better material might also look case samsung galaxy tab blackberry rim since size giving star mainly like snap allows swivel fire horizontal vertical quality great going make modification make work without collapsing using touch screen,"11 19, 2011",A2E6R5K2VZ0N5Q,Amazon Customer,,Not As Good As I Expected,1321660800,True,165,0

2976,5102,361153,361153,B00BTVTA0U,,4.0,"I ordered one of these from a vendor on Amazon, and the product came with scratches on the screen, which I could live with.  What I could not live with, though, is that the video would tend to freeze when a file was playing back, after about 30 seconds or so into it.  This was true whether I chose five-minute or two-minute recordings, and occurred on two different micro cards (16Gb and 32GB), thus the unit itself was clearly at fault.  So, I sent that one back.

I ordered a second one from eBestrade, and it seems to work okay.  This time the screen came with a protective cover that I peeled off, and the unit records and plays back without issue. The only negative, as a few other reviews have noted, is that the back camera recordings are inverted, meaning it's like you're viewing the video image from a mirror.  Street signs read backwards, and it looks like you're driving in England...everything is reversed.  Apparently they all have this defect.

Interestingly, you'll notice that this same design is sold by quite a few vendors at different prices, some shipped from the US, some shipped from the US with Amazon Prime as an option, and some shipped from China or Hong Kong. From what I can tell, though, they all have the same features. The first one I purchased was packaged in a completely different box than the second, but other than that they both had exactly the same functionality.

I chose this particular design because it is the only one I found with a detachable, wired rear camera.  Many accidents are caused by being hit from behind, so I didn't want a dash cam that only recorded what was going on in the front of my vehicle.

The unit records into two files, one for the front camera and one for the rear.  It will take up to a 32GB micro SD card.  I have a 16GB in mine, which is easily sufficient because it loop records, meaning it will start to record over the older files once the card fills up.  With my 40-mile round trip to work, I can record several days worth of driving before it starts to record over the older files.

I have found the picture quality from both cameras, front and rear, to be adequate.  You will NOT be able to read license plates from either camera...definitely not from the back camera (it would be inverted anyway), and not from the front camera either, unless conditions are absolutely perfect (vehicle stopped, close, and very bright lighting).  So, if someone side-swipes you and takes off, you'll get video of the car speeding away, but that will be about it.

On the other hand, though, if some idiot cuts you off, or plows into you from behind, and an accident does unfortunately occur, you'll have very good footage of what took place.

The unit is very small and very light.  So small, I have to get a magnifying glass to read the menu choices on the screen.  The settings for it are many...you can pretty much tweak it to do whatever you want it to do.  You will, though, need to play around with the buttons to figure out how to find, select and save your choices.  The written instructions are pretty bad (mine came in both English and Chinese), so learning through trial and error is really the best way.

It seems to work fine for what it is made for. Don't expect a solid, well-built, name-brand Sony or Samsung type product.  This is a low-cost, Chinese manufactured device.  Both of the units I bought came with English menus already activated.  It mounts securely to the windshield, and is not at all noticeable when you're driving if you place it strategically.  Also note that even though the wire connecting the rear camera is really long, to get the wire hidden away in my SUV (an Armada), I am going to need to get an extension cable.  I don't think this will be necessary in most cars, though.

The unit will power on and off with the vehicle as long as you have it plugged into a 12-volt socket that also powers on and off with the vehicle. Some of the sockets in my SUV are constantly on, so I have purchased a splitter (this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Multi-Use-Vehicle-Charger-with-Dual-USB-Ports-and-Dual-12-Volt-Sockets-Magnadyne/dp/B000PB8CQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Multi-Use Vehicle Charger with Dual USB Ports and Dual 12 Volt Sockets - Magnadyne</a>) to accommodate it, since I also have an external GPS unit that also needs to power on and off with the vehicle.  The dash cam stays on for about 15 seconds after the ignition is switched off.

Considering all of the above, for what you get for $70 (as of this writing), I consider this dash cam a four-star deal.

First off, these are not the type of stylus that are dual function as a writing pen (which personally are my favorites!). I still gave these a 5 star rating though because of all my stylus pens I've owned that are dual functioning, they don't work on my tablet.

I have been wanting a stylus that will work well on my HTC One M8 as well as our Google Nexus 7 2013 tablet and this one fits the bill! I actually ordered one just for the tablet and it cost more than this one but this Fenix stylus pleasantly surprised me!...

Very pretty shade of metallic purple with a soft lavender tip. This stylus works best when used lightly, like a paint brush, otherwise, like many stylus, it can catch some drag.

I love that I don't need to apply any pressure and it works well on both my phone and tablet. This makes it my favorite stylus (it just needs an ink function)! Smile.

It has a metal tip with a hole for a cell phone loop or wrist lanyard and a pen clip so you can attach the stylus to a pocket or notebook.

The length is a bit shorter than others I own but I find it to be sufficient and like how lightweight it is.

It's also a bit thicker than other stylus pens and I didn't expect to like that but it feels comfortable to grip. Definitely a matter of personal preference!

I've been using this stylus for about a month and gave the other two to friends. This stylus also looks especially cute with my phone case, lol, so I'll likely be buying some soon. The current price ($4.99) for the 3 are extremely reasonable, in my opinion!

So far so good (two weeks) on a Mac with 10.10.3 Yosemite.  I'm hoping that 10.10.4 doesn't mess things up.  Wish ioSafe made a Firewire version.  I'm on an older Mac with nothing but sad slow USB2 and Firewire.  This drive is doing all it can with USB2 but Firewire would have made a vast difference.

Started right out of the box.  Sooooo SILENT, I mean NOT A SOUND, that I called their tech support thinking it was dead.  I hadn't even looked to the front for the tiny blue light (idiotic I know).  The USB cord is thick and sturdy.  Jack ends are secure.

Tech support was kind when I called to ask was it DOA.  Even offered a free new cord when their new cord comes out.  Current one is an off the rack brick made in China whose ends don't insert fully.  Nothing fails just feels and looks odd which is why I thought the unit might be a dud.  Pics added so you can see what I mean.

I'm just hoping the unit lasts like my La Cie Neil Poulton.  I was at wits end as to what to buy. La Cie certainly doesn't have the rep it had back when I bought that drive in 2008.  No usb/firewire drive had a better than 30% rapid failure rate based upon reviews except this brand and Glyph.  The Glyph I purhcased failed in less than one month.  I was very concerned that some say ioSAFE is writing their own five star reviews and they fail as often as any other plus their free data restore seems to disappoint.  I assure you this is regular old me and I had no interest in their Tee Shirt giveway (offered for writing any kind of a review).

1558,6149,720264,720264,B007U66T66,,5.0,"Puma social buds, keg buds earphones.

- I have accepted that earphones die an early death and I have stopped ranting and raving about their early demise. It seems that only luck and fate determines how long your earphones last.
- I am not a world renowned audiophile and I am just an enthusiastic casual listener of music. So what I may regard as 'decent' you may regard as 'rubbish'.
- I was skeptical about buying Puma earphones especially after buying Sketchers earphones which died after two weeks. I replaced them and the replacements didn't fare any better. I thought that shoe companies would all make crappy earphones. I was wrong. I purchased Puma El Diego earphones on sale and they were very good and then I stumbled across these here on Amazon and gambled. I'm glad I did. These keg buds are decent and for the price are worth It. I use mine primarily as 'commuter' earphones. I only use them to listen to music or watch movies on the phone while on a bus/train/subway and walking to and from the bus/train station  I have not put them through the rigorous sweaty workouts that strike a death knell on earphones. For workouts, I use the iHip active (just the grey ones, other colors like bright green die early and the NFL iHips have the worst sound ever!) or the Polk Audio 500 or 1000 (too much bass)

- they have decent sound. They don't have as much bass as the Polk Audio 500/1000 (too much bass I might add) but they send the sound very well to your ears.
- the pouch provided is very helpful as it protects the earphones from damages and external influences and I religiously put the earphones in so that I cannot misplace them. Very nice addition.
- they sound like they have too much 'treble' in the beginning but after a week burn-in period, the 'treble' softens and all sounds blend in.
- they stick to your ear well enough and do not slide out. What I did, as I was taught, was to use two different sizes of earbuds (3 sizes are provided) and then determine which size fits you better and then put the corresponding earbud on the other ear.
- they don't hurt after hours of usage, if you position them right. I had positioned them wrong the first couple of days and the outer hard plastic scratched on my ear and hurt me after a while. I slightly twisted the earphones and they felt right and the pain went away.
- they do have a mic option which is pretty cool as you can use them to talk on the phone. They do not have a feature for adjusting the volume like the Puma El Diego but I adjust the volume rarely and I do it on the actual phone, so it's not a big deal.
- I interchange them with the Puma El Diego earphones, which for me, rank amongst the best 2 'commuter' earphones I have used. The problem with the Puma El Diego is that they slide out so often that they are best used with a skullcap in the colder months where they are secured to the ears. As it gets warmer, they do slide out often, forcing me to keep sticking them back to the ear. If only they didn't slide out. If they fall within your budget range, get the El Diego as they have an almost perfect balance of bass and treble. Once again, I am not a world renowned audiophile.
- I bought a second pair so that I would be stocked up once the first pair bought suffers the inevitable audio mortality. Hopefully, they'll last a while.

In short, they are good average earphones for the average user and are worth buying at the price offered. If you are anal about your sounds, then these are not your ideal earphones. These are for casual listening. If you want to hear the exhilarating twang of B.B King's guitar just as it was in studio, then check elsewhere.",puma social bud keg bud earphone accepted earphone die early death stopped ranting raving early demise seems luck fate determines long earphone last world renowned audiophile enthusiastic casual listener music may regard decent may regard rubbish skeptical buying puma earphone especially buying sketcher earphone died two week replaced replacement fare better thought shoe company would make crappy earphone wrong purchased puma el diego earphone sale good stumbled across amazon gambled glad keg bud decent price worth use mine primarily commuter earphone use listen music watch movie phone bus train subway walking bus train station put rigorous sweaty workout strike death knell earphone workout use ihip active grey one color like bright green die early nfl ihips worst sound ever polk audio much bass decent sound much bass polk audio much bass might add send sound well ear pouch provided helpful protects earphone damage external influence religiously put earphone cannot misplace nice addition sound like much treble beginning week burn period treble softens sound blend stick ear well enough slide taught use two different size earbuds size provided determine size fit better put corresponding earbud ear hurt hour usage position right positioned wrong first couple day outer hard plastic scratched ear hurt slightly twisted earphone felt right pain went away mic option pretty cool use talk phone feature adjusting volume like puma el diego adjust volume rarely actual phone big deal interchange puma el diego earphone rank amongst best commuter earphone used problem puma el diego slide often best used skullcap colder month secured ear get warmer slide often forcing keep sticking back ear slide fall within budget range get el diego almost perfect balance bass treble world renowned audiophile bought second pair would stocked first pair bought suffers inevitable audio mortality hopefully last short good average earphone average user worth buying price offered anal sound ideal earphone casual listening want hear exhilarating twang b b king guitar studio check elsewhere,"04 2, 2015",A13YCEHOME8UYC,iluvgr8tdeals,,Perfect As Commuter Earphones...,1427932800,True,,1

That thing has held up super well, but was super dirty and the screen protector that came with it was starting to bubble and show it's age. I am in love with the glass screen protectors for my iPhone so I wanted to give this a try on the iPad. It looks fantastic, and fit back with the case without an issue. It also goes edge to edge, unlike the protectors that exist on the iPhone. If you want a clean look with added protection for your device, this is the screen protector you want.

I will say, that after it's all applied everything is working perfectly. But I will say that I had a little tough of a time applying this. It comes with the wet wipes and dry wipes to make sure everything is clear and dust free on the screen so after going through and making sure everything was clean I went on to the next step. I started to peel the tab to take off the protection on the adhesive side, but the tab came off without anything else.

Initially, I thought that the SI was not working but after help from Humminbird found out that it was due to technology limitations that I had not been aware of.  For best imaging, boat speed should be around 3-4 mph, with calm water, and minimal side-to-side rocking.  The boat should be moving approximately straight, and the chart speed should be matched to the boat speed.  Such conditions are not present every day in the Gulf but when they are, the imaging works and is far more informative than traditional sonar.  Included below are a video of my marina's channel, and an image from an 'artificial reef', an area with concrete rubble.  The recordings include the GPS coordinates, and allow creating waypoints while reviewing the scans at home.
BTW, per my discussion with Humminbird support, the processors used in the Helix 5 SI and 7 SI are the same, and other than the size of the display, there are no substantive differences between the two units.",div id video block r ozisa ip f class section spacing small spacing top mini video block div input type hidden name value http image na ssl image amazon com image b b dgxs mp class video url input type hidden name value http image na ssl image amazon com image j besvts png class video slate img url nbsp first side imaging sonar initially thought si working help humminbird found due technology limitation aware best imaging boat speed around mph calm water minimal side side rocking boat moving approximately straight chart speed matched boat speed condition present every day gulf imaging work far informative traditional sonar included video marina channel image artificial reef area concrete rubble recording include gps coordinate allow creating waypoints reviewing scan home btw per discussion humminbird support processor used helix si si size display substantive difference two unit,"10 4, 2015",A12F3TS5S4RA74,weltwind,,side imaging is much better than traditional sonar,1443916800,True,79,1

The issue is the plastic tab that you use to pull the speaker cable out from the body with... it's super flimsy and the tab already shows stress marks after my first time opening it.  It's basically a piece of plastic as thin as paper and as small as match head that you have to grasp with your finger nails and pull on any time you open it, and it's part of the normal molding so don't think that it's going to be especially durable plastic.  The same two plastic tabs get stuck on the carrying case liner when you put it in and out of it's protective case.

1151,7068,551784,551784,B00SU0LULU,,5.0,"I've been using this mySight Wi-Fi camera from iLuv for about a month now - long enough to know that the camera works great and the app is solid and reliable.

I've set up a number of IP cameras and I can definitely say that this one is the easiest and most straightforward of any I have ever used. It's a camera I would absolutely recommend for tech-phobic people as well as tech geeks.

Before buying, understand that you will need a smart phone or tablet - android or iOS - and wireless internet access wherever you want to place the camera. You can monitor your camera from a computer after setup but you MUST have a smart phone or tablet for set up because it requires a free, downloadable app for initial setup.

It comes beautifully and securely boxed. The camera itself is just really attractive. It almost looks like a small piece of sculpture. It's pretty enough that it looks great just sitting on an end table in my living room but it comes with hardware to mount it on a wall if that works better for your home. The camera can be manually tilted back and forth to allow you to aim it perfectly at your door or window. It comes with a nice, ribbon style power cord that's 10 ft long so you have some flexibility in where you place the camera.

The setup guide is simple and well written and easy to follow. Basically, you download and install the free iVideon app, set up an account, and then hold your phone in front of the camera. The app generates a QR code and when the camera sees it, it automatically connects it to your account. Then the app prompts you to enter your wifi network name (SSID) and password, which it sends to the camera. After a short period of time, the camera connects to your wireless network and you're all set.

If you have trouble with the camera failing to connect, move it closer your router or or orient it differently and try again. It make take a few tries but once it connects to your wifi, you can move it to a different location with no problem.

Be sure to remove the clear film that is covering the camera lens when unboxing to get the clearest picture.

From the app on your phone or tablet, you can monitor your camera in real time and you can also set it up for alerts - sound and motion. I have mine set up at a second home that is unoccupied most of the time. It's near a window and I get a sound alert when someone is mowing the lawn or when it's raining hard or when my neighbor's dogs come and bark at the door to see if I'm there. It sends a short clip, complete with audio, to my phone. It works flawlessly.

You can easily turn off notifications from the app for times when there will be lots of activity and you'd be getting constant alerts.

The camera is a wide angle lens so it covers a really large area. The resolution is HD 720p and is very clear. The night vision is just fabulous. My neighbor has the key and goes in to check things from time to time and I can clearly see his face. If someone broke in, the video is definitely good enough for police to use.

It even features 2-way communication! You can talk remotely to someone in the room remotely. I would have loved to have this when my mother was alive and I think this would be fantastic for anyone with older relatives that live on their own. Way better than one of those Life-Alerts for a lot of situations. Plus, you can add several mySight cameras and monitor them all from your app.

If you want to have continuous back-ups, iLuv offers cloud-based storage for a very reasonable $20/mo but it isn't necessary to get the alerts and video clips.

This camera does not have a remote tilt and pan feature and it isn't full, 1080p resolution but the app is great, the camera is very good, the night vision is excellent and the setup couldn't be simpler. If you need a security camera that doesn't require wiring and you can easily monitor from your phone or tablet, this is a great one to consider.

With 2 microdrives I can achieve that quaintly with no computer necessary! And the cost of a single drive is recouped in 3 sessions (Film and processing costs eliminated).
Cons: Horrible low light sensitivity...Slow saving in the HiRes modes and the camera controls TOTALLY lock up while the cache is written to the disk/drive (after 3 consecutive shots in HiRes ONLY). You can shoot, but not change ANYTHING manually. This problem disappears in the JPEG modes which are fine for many applications. Autofocus is slow at extreme telephoto setting and in low light. AND the shutter release button delay is intolerable when using flash or in low light.

I've installed various other screens on my other PDA's.  This product is unlike some of the other screen protectors as it requires the spray that comes with the product.

As I usually do, I turned the shower on to knock out the dust in the air, washed my hands and wiped the screen with the lint free cloth provided with the kit.  I then removed the screen from the sheet and sprayed it down on the contact side with the spray bottle provided.  I also gave a couple of sprays directly on the ipad's screen, and then placed the protector as per the instructions.  With the rubber wedge provided, I squeegeed the remaining fluids, and I wiped the excess with a microfiber towel.

After completing the process, I couldn't wait and turned on my Ipad sooner than recommended.  As the product hadn't fully dried, there was a slight rainbow effect.  About an hour after use, the rainbow effect diminished and was completely gone a couple of hours thereafter.  At first there seemed to be some spray residue on the screen, but the next day all residue and rainbow effect were completely gone and it was crystal clear.

First, as others have noted, the low light performance is not good at all. I suppose the internal algorithms just get confused, but it's hard to get a good exposure in low light, and colors seem a fair amount off from both the human eye and my other cameras. The autofocus seems to ""hunt"" more than other cameras too, including my old Canon Powershot and the Lumix (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-Lumix-DMC-LX5-10-1-MP-Digital-Camera-with-3-8x-Optical-Image-Stabilized-Zoom-and-3-0-Inch-LCD-Black/dp/B003WJR69E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD - Black</a>) I got to replace it.

The image quality, even in normal light, is nothing special. The Lumix is quite a bit better, and this is certainly not in the same league as a DSLR. My Canon T3 is only 12 megapixel compared to 16 for this camera, and it takes much, much better shots.

This will do for casual photos, but I expect some of my travel photos to eventually end up in a book, so I need better quality than this camera seems to take. Other reviews say you can tweak this and that to get better quality, but I'm not willing to navigate the menus, because...

I found the interface to be pretty confusing. I eventually navigated through the menus to change the settings I needed, but it was unnecessarily complex and frustrating to do it. There's just no reason for a camera menu to have such a poorly designed user interface.

On the good side, it takes a lot of pictures on a charge, the zoom range is pretty good, and it's very compact. I like the auto lens cap, too.

I don't want to sound condescending, but it seems that some of the reviewers thought that this device should take low-res VHS quality video and convert it to crisp 1080p. I could be wrong about that, but that's what it seemed to me. I love this setup, I have looked at products that cost hundreds of dollars and wondered why I would spend that on my old low-res home videos. Some reviewers complained they had to buy patch cords to connect it. They now include a patch cord. I used one of my better quality cables for audio and had an old S-video cable that I used for the video feed. You have to adjust the settings to do that. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to change where it sends the file. It defaults to Drive (C), My Videos.  I have Sony Vegas Pro so I can make any adjustments needed such as cropping off the artifacts like curled black borders from my 25 year old videotapes or adjusting light levels, etc.  The included ArcSoft programs have features so you can adjust the frame size from  the default to a smaller line count. For example, I used an old Super VHS deck to feed to the Diamond hardware and was using standard VHS recordings. The converter sees 525 lines even though the actual recording was probably more like 380 lines. I have not tried yet, but I think I could set it for less line and do just as well. It also has brightness and contrast adjustments.  It allows you to save in your choice of 4 different files; MPEG-1, MPEG-2, AVI, or WMV, so you could upload your file to Youtube as is, if you want to. It also will allow you to capture a single frame, if you wish, to save a picture, albeit a softly focused one.",working great read many review ordered want sound condescending seems reviewer thought device take low re vhs quality video convert crisp p could wrong seemed love setup looked product cost hundred dollar wondered would spend old low re home video reviewer complained buy patch cord connect include patch cord used one better quality cable audio old video cable used video feed adjust setting took minute figure change sends file default drive c video sony vega pro make adjustment needed cropping artifact like curled black border year old videotape adjusting light level etc included arcsoft program feature adjust frame size default smaller line count example used old super vhs deck feed diamond hardware using standard vhs recording converter see line even though actual recording probably like line tried yet think could set le line well also brightness contrast adjustment allows save choice different file mpeg mpeg avi wmv could upload file youtube want also allow capture single frame wish save picture albeit softly focused one,"02 6, 2015",A2RZ321KO5TVNZ,Hank Wegener,{'Style:': ' PC'},Fantastic!,1423180800,False,2,1

This hasn't impacted the performance but the drives are much more loose when sitting in the bay.  We have used all different sized drives with great success.  2.5"" and 3.5"" all work fine.

Please not that these tweeters are almost 3 inches deep. So way before you attempt to cut any holes in your car. I would suggest to plan way way ahead and get you fishing tape, or flexible tape, or heck even get you a piece of wood that measures almost 3 inches deep and get you double sided tape. So when you find an area that you really want to get that amazing custom look inside your car. You can plan way ahead and find that perfect spot by planning ahead with your wood or your measurements way before you cut your hole. Also note that the hole cut out diameter is correct for the speaker. But the Terminals on the tweeters stick out farther than the cutout diameter. So when you pick out your perfect spot to place these speakers. You will have to trim out about a 1/4 inch more out at only where the terminals protrude from. I would suggest just getting a drill bit that is a hair wider than the terminals and just grind out the 1/4 inch worth of space to get these speakers to go flush. I wouldn't suggest over cutting the entire hole to be bigger just to get the terminals to fit as you will have issues with mounting holes lining up. Other than these suggestions.

I wanted something similar to Apple's earbuds that have that rubber design to help prevent slippage out of the ear, and these have that feature.  Audio from these headphones are better than I had expected. Highs are good, but the bass was surprising.  I had read other reviews that said bass was lacking, but there is some bass in there; not the sort that you'd receive from costlier in-ear/noise cancelling sets, but it's not like there isn't any at all. Probably from a scale of 1 to 10 in bass, they're a 6-7.  Overall comfort is good too. For my medium-small ears they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I've used them while washing my car (not that they're water-proof, just an example of time worn), walking around, jogging, and just music listening. Again, I especially love the rubber lining on the earbuds, as they help prevent the headphones from slipping out of my ears.

First problem is that the software is problematic, you can make a change to the router and not be able to access the settings to undo the changes. Which if you are troubleshooting the settings to get a printer to work, you can essentially brick the entire device. The warranty only covers you for either 30 or 60 days, so if you have trouble with a computer, phone, printer or anything else after that, you have to pay a third-party support company to basically click a button in order to restore your device to factory settings.

That doesn't sound like a good plan, but also it is only offered by yearly support, and the cost of the support is more than a newer, better model from a top competitor.

It's a bit confusing to switch from mono to stereo, presets, that kind of stuff but you get the hang of it. Sound quality is good, not flawless it does cut out sometimes.

My two biggest problems with this transmitter, and reasons why I had to change my review. One, the transmitter goes from 88.1 to 107.x... I live in Wisconsin, we don't have a whole lot of stations compared to some places, so I can't imagine this thing would work as well for people in say, Chicago, or Milwaukee, or some place more urban than where I am.

Second, and a little more worrying, where the thing plugged into my ipod, the rubber coating came loose from the plug making some of the wires exposed. This I did not like, I tossed it the day I noticed it because the last thing I wanted was a potential fire hazard. And for anybody that thing I stretched the cord too far or something like that. No. Most of the time I had it in a little spot about a foot infront of the plug (think 04+ Pontiac Grand Prix, little spot infront of shifter, with it plugged in right behind shifter). So there's no way I was stretched the cord, bending the cord or anything like it shouldn't have been.

I solved my quest for knowledge by going to youtube.com to find videos on how to install and set up the camera. Once I got it going I was fine. One show stopper right off the bat was that the cable shipped with the unit was bad. I was getting no lights on the network connection at all. I tried my own cable and bingo, it worked.

Once the camera is set up, it seems to perform and work great. There are some IPHONE and IPAD apps that can be used to control the camera. The app made by EasyN didn't work at all for me. I found another app called Eye Net Camera for my Android that does work, and another free app for the IPAD that worked.

4/12/2013 - Now that I've used this for quite a while I'm even more impressed. It keeps humming along, no issues.

Some points: I couldn't for the life of me get it to work in our business, but I could get it to work at home. It turned out that the wireless router at the business was an older model and wouldn't let the camera connect. Once I replaced the router, bingo, it worked.

The motion alarm is a great feature. We set it so that at night, if someone enters our business, we record them. The video files are uploaded to our FTP website, so even if a thief finds and destroys the camera, they can't get the video unlike most expensive systems.

The software used to set the motion alarm is tedious. They make you click a little square box for each 30 minute timeframe, for each day, that you want to set the alarm. It takes hundreds of clicks to cover the entire night. It would have been easier if they let you SHIFT and drag a whole section of time, but they didn't. If you turn off the alarm , your settings are wiped out and you must do it all again.  That's frustrating.",like chinese product feel cheap get job done like everyone else baffled instruction solved quest knowledge going youtube com find video install set camera got going fine one show stopper right bat cable shipped unit bad getting light network connection tried cable bingo worked camera set seems perform work great iphone ipad apps used control camera app made easyn work found another app called eye net camera android work another free app ipad worked used quite even impressed keep humming along issue point life get work business could get work home turned wireless router business older model let camera connect replaced router bingo worked motion alarm great feature set night someone enters business record video file uploaded ftp website even thief find destroys camera get video unlike expensive system software used set motion alarm tedious make click little square box minute timeframe day want set alarm take hundred click cover entire night would easier let shift drag whole section time turn alarm setting wiped must frustrating,"05 26, 2012",A26Z15QFLWZJ5Z,Scott Ames,,"Works well, if you can figure it out, feels cheap",1337990400,True,,1

2836,4383,32799,32799,B0007MXZB2,,2.0,"This antenna looks like an effective design, with an impressive UHF array and 44-inch VHF elements that collapse nicely into the body when not needed (as with all digital stations prior to Feb 2009).  Additionally, the VHF elements should be useful after Feb '09 when some digital channels migrate from UHF to VHF.

But the proof is in received signal strength, and actual measurements with this antenna compared to a basic 7-inch UHF loop (like you find on the cheapest rabbit-ears indoor antenna) were a major disappointment.  A channel 35.1 signal that measured 60 (out of 100) with the loop was only 55 with the HDTVa, with its amplifier properly connected and turned off.  Turning it on produced no significant improvement.  Bypassing the amplifier was far worse, less than 40.

I found it curious that the worst performance resulted from connecting the antenna directly to the TV, bypassing the amplifier module.  There must be some major impedance mismatch at the antenna's output that the module corrects, which strikes me as a weird design.  You shouldn't have to connect an amplifier to an antenna unless it's needed.

I note that many reviewers here rate it highly, but I wonder if any them did any objective comparison testing.  After all, the antenna WILL work to some degree wherever an indoor signal is possible, but is it superior to anything else?

833,3406,276424,276424,B006U3ZJSE,,5.0,"I bough this as a backup/emergency GPS for 2 hiking trips in UK.
My main GPS is actually my phone, Samsung S4.
So, I didn't want to spend too much money a backup GPS.  Bushnell BackTrack fits that requirement.
I lived in US, northeast coast, where I received the product and tested.
It did take 3-4 mins linking up with the satellites for the first time.  All subsequent links were pretty fast.
Same thing when I arrived at the UK airport, the first link took a while.  All subsequent links were quick.  My guess is that the GPS remembers where the satellites locations were and able to link quicker the next time around.

The usage of battery power (2x AAA) is small.  After one week of use, the battery is still full.  I even had 4 hours of continue use on one of the trips.

Compass is functional even without satellites signals.
The only thing to remember is to read the BackTrack flat, if read in an angle, it will not give an accurate direction.
Also, it will not connect in narrow valley.  After coming out of valley, its fine.

There was this one time I came back to my car, and the BackTrack GPS said I'm still 70 yards off...  Well, the problem is the ""Mark"".

The Quick connect is a great alternative universal mount for anyone looking to standardize one or more cameras to multiple platforms. If you're looking to swap from a tripod to a mono pod to a cable cam to a jib to a shoulder rig to a steady cam or whatever - then this is for you. It will work, even with heavier cameras as the Sony NEX-VG20, but caution should be used in high stress/vibration situations.  I don't recommend this for lens-heavy set ups.  The base/mounting puck is about 7/8"" high and about 2.5"" diameter. The square camera plate is about 1 3/8"" square at it's widest and 1/4"" high. The benefit of the square plate is that the camera can be oriented in a North, South, East, West configuration on a tripod, etc. simply by releasing the lock, lifting the camera and remounting where you need it.

The entire review is relevant to both parts of this system. One thing I forgot to mention was that I had called Dell to see what they had available,and they were using a mix of Linksys parts as well. So I decided to go direct with Linksys equipment. Here is the review as submitted.
For an item that was not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I first bought it from Amazon, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.
What about hookup and use? Another 5 star performance. If you have never hooked up a wireless network before, take the advice of the quick start guide that comes with the unit, and use their included CD. They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure it. Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, you can see, that is the best way to go. The setup using the CD is about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. Shutting off what they tell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, results in a delightful install. Not even one glitch. The CD determines your internet connection, then it determines your system configuration, asks a few questions, and bingo you are up and running.
I install the PC Card for laptops as well, and that is just as easy to install. Within 10 minutes your surfing the web from all over the house. No Wires !
Pertaining to the speed issue: Remember when I discuss this that their is a difference between the speed inside of your network, and the the speed you are connecting to the web. I got 54MBps while I was in the same room. When I went into the living room, it went to very good, instead of excellent, and gave me 37MBps. Let's get a perspective here. A standard modem works at 56kbps tops. This router works at 54MBps that's megabyte not kilobyte. Their are 1024 kilobytes in every megabyte. So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem. When hooked up to a Verizon DSL basic connection, you are running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobits on the download end, and 100 to 150 upload speed. I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card. What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.
Faster connect speeds are important when communicating across the network, between machines, like when backing up drives across the network. For that reason, the faster N designated wireless is a little bit more expensive, but a lot faster than G. To go a step farther the ultimate in inter network communications, a hard wired gigabit or 2 gigabit connection rules. So the ultimate is to use an N connection for your router, which is your connection to the slower web, and use the faster N to a portable device, then hook up a gigabit switch, to run your hard wired connections between your devices in the network. I guess I am getting off on a tangent here, so back to the device at hand, which is still the most popular selling adapter.
Anyhow, just for reference, hooking up a DSL, or a broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast, with the Windows XP operating system, installation was as near automatic as can be. They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.
All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. Follow the directions exactly. It is easy. Hope this helps. This is the reason why I have a website, to help people with their installations. Did you know that as much as 30 percent of the wireless network products are sent back, because people give up trying to install them? Let's all save Amazon from the return product blues.

When I am trying to type the letter ""P"" with the tablet on its side, I cannot. I have to tip the tablet back up (so the buttons are all on the top) tap the letter, or backspace and type. Even when using a separate keyboard, this is an issue. That is my only Con at this point. Pros: color and sound are great, it is easy to use (except for the con) and lightweight. It is the perfect size for holding in my lap and slipping into my purse to carry with me.

UPDATE: The problem with the touch screen was fixed very quickly and easily. The Amazon people are awesome. The main complaint I have at this point is that I have yet to figure out a way to use the 32g sd card I got to go with it. The tablet acknowledges that the card is there, but that is all. I cannot move any apps to it or access anything I have on it. That mystifies me. Tip: Keep it updated! My tablet will just stop working unless I keep the updates up tp date.

1248,8884,225262,225262,B004YIFOZ0,,4.0,"* Easy to follow instructions:
Not sure what the other 1 star reviewer was talking about, something about cheap instruction stickers that are directly on the protective screen(film), ruining the protective film when she tried to remove it. Just like another reviewer had stated, each film has a clear mask on each side when it is new, and yes, they look like cheap instruction stickers on the mask, but they are on the mask and NOT on the actual protective film. On the masks, one side says ""Step 1, clean tablet before applying film"", on that same side of the mask, another sticker says ""peel off this mask before applying the film"". Once you are done applying the film properly onto the screen, the mask on the other side of the film says ""peel off this mask AFTER film is positioned correctly"". Anyway, the instructions were very easy to follow.

* Thickness
It is 0.13 mm thick, feels thick, should help with accidental scratching.

* Problem
I did run into a problem, when trying to put on the first film. I cleaned the screen as instructed, I only applied about 2 inches of the film, using the smoothing card to remove the bubbles, then noticed a single bubble that would not go away, right below the camera, looked like there was a tiny speck of dirt under the film, causing the bubble, I pulled the film off and checked the film and screen, there was nothing visible, so I tried putting the film back on, same issue, got frustrated and crumbled the film and threw it out. Grabbed the second film, same exact problem, got frustrated and threw that out. So I decided to use the tablet without a screen protector. I did whip the screen by breathing on it and using your typical bath towel, without any scratches. So far, the tablet screen seems as durable as the screen on the iPod, which I never used a screen protector, and I whip the hell out of it with my shirt for over a year, without a single scratch. Oh well, wasted money on this, but it is not the product's fault, as far as I can tell. Since I've never had a screen protector on my iPod and I let my 4 yr old son play with it, since he was about 2.5 yrs old, and there is not a single scratch, I bought these for the tablet, mainly out of paranoia, just because of the brand new item mentality, kind of like having a brand new car, where you will baby the hell out of it at first.

* Star Rating
I'm giving this a 4 star, because I cannot say that I'm 100% sure that the problem was with the brand new screen protectors or not, since I was unable to see that single speck of dirt that may had been on the screen.

UPDATE 4/24/2013

578,4304,193739,193739,B00427TAIK,,5.0,"I suffered for a while with a standard mouse.  Arm pains, elbow pains, wrist pains. Took me a while to take the leap and spend so much on a new mouse.  Mice are supposed to be a dime a dozen - in fact I had a few high quality mice which still gave me pain. It got really bad.

So finally, I decided to buy the Evoluent Vertical Mouse. After much research on different ergonomic mice and trying a trackball (no way couldn't get used to it) and trying a few other options short of spending so much on a darn mouse - I realized it was either this or nothing - I took the leap and bought it.

Super glad I did.  For the first couple weeks I thought I made a mistake buying this mouse. It was somewhat awkward and at first didn't fully relieve the pain. But I stuck with it. Slowly, I started not to notice the mouse when using it (which is a good thing).  I also don't know exactly how long it took but I had no more pain. And I am now actually almost as accurate in movement as my standard mouse of 20 years.

While I think 20+ years of using a regular mouse is hard to break - it took about 1-2 months until I was totally comfortable with the Evoluent Mouse - But now I LOVE IT and cant go back. Whenever I switch to using a regular mouse (even those ones that claim to be ergonomic but really just have a curve to them) I notice right away the strain put on my arm.

The build quality is excellent, the color and style are attractive. I am picky and find I am very satisfied with this mouse. They did not cut corners on the build quality - very nice.

I HIGHLY recommend this mouse and would not hesitate to get it again if I need to.  But you must give it a fair chance to work and I think you will find yourself not even noticing it has cured your pain - which is the way it should be.  Now, to get myself a better keyboard.

UPDATE: After using this mouse for many months - I am happier than ever with my purchase. You must give it time to get out of old habits.

The protector wasn't super thick, but it wasn't super flimsy either.  It was easily manipulated using the spray and was extremely easy to install.  You spray the adheasive part of the protector and then you can move it around on the screen until it fits to where you want it.  It didn't pick up any finger prints despite the fact that I touched it a few times.

Very easy install and it was a perfect fit.  The feel of the protector is very nice in comparison to the feel of the Kindle's natural screen texture.  It's a smooth feel and so far I haven't had any issues using the touch screen.  It honestly doesn't even look like there is a screen protector on it at all.  The install kit comes with a rubber applicator that helped get all of the bubbles out no problem.

This is one of the few installs I've ever had that there were no bubbles or nothing got caught on the screen thanks to the cloth provided with it.  This includes everything you'd need to install the product.  The only thing that I found lacking was that there are no install instructions included, but it does direct you to their website to read them.

Overall, this is a great product.  I'm actually going to buy more armor suit screen protectors for my other devices.  What I like most about this is that you don't have to be extremely good at applying screens to apply this.  Spraying the back allows you to move it around easily and peel it off if you mess up without ruining the screen.",intial attempt install go great wound getting little spec something stuck screen actually came spraying armor suit spray came screen protector gently rubbing finger protector super thick super flimsy either easily manipulated using spray extremely easy install spray adheasive part protector move around screen fit want pick finger print despite fact touched time easy install perfect fit feel protector nice comparison feel kindle natural screen texture smooth feel far issue using touch screen honestly even look like screen protector install kit come rubber applicator helped get bubble problem one installs ever bubble nothing got caught screen thanks cloth provided includes everything need install product thing found lacking install instruction included direct website read overall great product actually going buy armor suit screen protector device like extremely good applying screen apply spraying back allows move around easily peel mess without ruining screen,"10 13, 2016",A1D9HT4IEAEJND,Jessica Weissenburger,,"Quick, Easy Install -- Don't Have to be an Expert!",1476316800,True,3,1

My first impression, out of the box is, I'm impressed.  It seems to act just like my Android phone.  It is very responsive for a 1GHz cpu.

The instructions that come with it are non-existent, a card with where the buttons are.  Their support page gives a URL error.  Their FAQs has no entries except for the specs.

Cons:
* The sound is very tinny.  It is not very good, especially compared to my friend's iPad.
*  No rear facing camera.  So this is only good for chat.  Can't really take pictures or use a scanner app.  A little disappointing.
* The auto-brightness doesn't work very well for me.  I think it makes the display too dark under all lighting conditions.
* It cannot play trailers from apple.com/trailers.
* The system tutorial in Settings->About Tablet doesn't work.  It just returns to the previous screen.
* Android 2.2 is not designed for tablets.  Google said this.
* The wireless can use 802.11n but only the 2.4GHz band and not the less cluttered 5GHz band.
* My biggest complaint is that both the on/off and the volume buttons are very hard to use.  They are too small or too recessed.

Pros:
* The display is very nice and a good size.
* Price, though I think they could have sprung for more than a 4gb card.  Even my phone came with 8bg card.
* Battery life seems real good.  I've been using it for over 3 hours over two days and it is at 56%.
* The Android system is a plus.  I hope it can be upgraded to 3.0+
*  It comes with the Kindle app installed and ebooks look real nice.  I do still like my Kindle better since it is so much lighter.
* Touch screen is very sensitive.  I find if I press too hard, it doesn't work. But of course that kind of sensitivity can be bad too, because I press things I don't mean to all the time.

Some other notes:  I tried Firefox mobile on it.  It doesn't feel like Firefox and the password manager doesn't allow for a master password and that made me nervous.  Also flash did not work with Firefox, so I removed it.  I do not like the generic Browser on Android.  So I will be looking for a new one.

I installed the ""Hackers Keyboard"" from the app store and really like that.  No more hunting around for special keys, they are all there.

I played some games that required interaction of the touch screen and the motion detections system.  Both worked very well.

You might think from all my cons that I don't like this tablet, but that is incorrect.  Most of the cons are nits.  If you are looking for a device that you can sit on the couch with, browse the web and check email, this is it.  It would be nice if the speakers sounded better (I'm looking for an equalizer app) and if the buttons were easier to use, but this is a very nice device for $350.

Update 5-30-11
As of today, I would NOT buy this tablet.  It does somethings nice, but many things including Netflix don't work and Le Pan has not plans to upgrade this to Andriod 2.3 let alone 3.0 or above.  They make a nice tablet and plan to release another 9.7 with 3.0, so I would wait.

Update 7-24-12
Now that I can, I've changed the rating to 2 star.  It was an okay tablet while it worked with the flaws mentioned above.  But as I suspected, they never updated the software.
Also, the Wi-Fi died.

The hardware and app were easy enough to connect and download respectively, and to get up and running w power and internet, but the base station was not able to be recognized. I followed the simple short steps and reset to factory default settings as directed many many times. I read through numerous community help comments and saw several people seemed to have had the same problem. I tried some of the fixes that were suggested (powering on, off, plugging in, out, resetting again and again). Just as I was about to give up and wait for morning to call customer service, it picked up my base station.  I am unclear what I did to make that happen, other than following the steps on the app and the forums over and over, so I can't really give any pointers. The few hours I spent trying to just set this up irritated me quite a bit.

When I got the cameras working (they paired very easily once the base station was picked up), I set them up in various parts of my home, and over the next several days tried the devices out. The color is very clear and the night vision very good, and the alerts seemed to be picking up a lot of the movement, especially when I tried them on two sides of the living room w high traffic- so much so that I turned the scheduling on only for times we were out, so I wouldn't get so many beeps on my phone or notification email in my inbox. When the weekend came, I had time to try to install these outside, and the limited wi-fi range (my wifi is fairly strong w a mesh system, but who knows) made it impossible to move the cameras even a few feet away from the walls of the house. One camera is outside our front door facing the courtyard's outer door, and I could not put the other camera outside at all, due to sporadic cut-outs and not working for hours at a time. So I placed it looking outside through a window towards the backyard, but the motion detector did not seem to pick up any movement  through the glass, and it didn't work at night due to the glass reflecting back at the camera. I re-positioned it inside looking at the inside of the backdoor.

Having used these for about a week now, it appears that the cameras only sporadically pick up movement, and you have to be fairly close- no more than about a few feet away.  Also, if you walk quickly through the camera zone, it may not pick up motion. This can be remedied by putting the cameras right next to the entrance you are interested in (it would take some stationary time to break in, but since the cameras are not recording unless the motion detector detects, this system is not reliable enough for security purposes I was desiring.

What the cameras seem best at doing, is monitoring real time inside or immediately outside your home, such as when you want to see your pet or baby sleeping or you hear a noise or something like that. Overall, though, I don't believe these cameras are consistent enough for security based on reliable motion detection. I noticed Arlo Pro provides longer distance motion detection, so this upgrade may be more useful.

Update: i added a star to this- 4 stars, ""I like this,"" because for the purposes of real time monitoring where you can check in and view, this system works very well.",set arlo camera system amount difficulty hardware app easy enough connect download respectively get running w power internet base station able recognized followed simple short step reset factory default setting directed many many time read numerous community help comment saw several people seemed problem tried fix suggested powering plugging resetting give wait morning call customer service picked base station unclear make happen following step app forum really give pointer hour spent trying set irritated quite bit got camera working paired easily base station picked set various part home next several day tried device color clear night vision good alert seemed picking lot movement especially tried two side living room w high traffic much turned scheduling time get many beep phone notification email inbox weekend came time try install outside limited wi fi range wifi fairly strong w mesh system know made impossible move camera even foot away wall house one camera outside front door facing courtyard outer door could put camera outside due sporadic cut out working hour time placed looking outside window towards backyard motion detector seem pick movement glass work night due glass reflecting back camera positioned inside looking inside backdoor used week appears camera sporadically pick movement fairly close foot away also walk quickly camera zone may pick motion remedied putting camera right next entrance interested would take stationary time break since camera recording unless motion detector detects system reliable enough security purpose desiring camera seem best monitoring real time inside immediately outside home want see pet baby sleeping hear noise something like overall though believe camera consistent enough security based reliable motion detection noticed arlo pro provides longer distance motion detection upgrade may useful update added star star like purpose real time monitoring check view system work well,"09 9, 2017",A23P5BO1UGNIRR,KC,{'Configuration:': ' 2 Camera Kit w/ Mount'},"Good For Real-time Monitoring, Somewhat Unreliable Motion Detection",1504915200,False,,1

I was really excited to unbox the laptop and begin using it immediately as this is the lightest and thinnest laptop that I've ever owned and it supposedly gets 10+ hours of battery life.  And as many other reviews have stated, you get a lot of bang for the buck.  At the moment no other laptop gives you a 256gb ssd and 8gb of ram for $699.  The only other feature I wished it has is a backlit keyboard.  I primarily use the laptop for surfing the web, light word processing, and some spreadsheet work and when working on the bed with the lights off, a backlit keyboard is a must.

I didn't run any benchmarks, but all of the work I've done on it so far has gone smoothly.  One thing I did check is the battery life.  I got about 7.5 hours of use off my first charge which I'm happy with since I travel quite a bit and can usually recharge before the battery runs out.  I couldn't say the same for my previous laptop which needed charging after 3 hours so this is a major improvement.

Almost everything about the laptop was perfect....the touchpad however drove me crazy.  For some reason I felt the right click made more noise than it should and just pressing it didn't feel like it clicked properly.  It felt like the touchpad was loose and made a clattering noise every time I pressed it.  I went back to the store and checked out the demo unit and the touchpad on the demo unit was firm and tight fitting.  Then I googled the problem and it seems like others were having the issue too.  I exchanged the laptop for another one and it had the same problem.  I then exchanged it one more time and the 3rd laptop still had the problem!  I was really bummed and was about to return it for a full refund.  I really wanted to keep the computer, but every time I clicked the touchpad it just bothered me.

I searched for a fix and came across a website that showed how to disassemble the laptop.  I was fairly hopeful that if I opened it up, I could easily fix the issue with some electrical tape which would tighten the gap that was making the touchpad behave the way it did.  Well I gently opened the back cover and examined the touchpad area.  I lightly tapped around and noticed that if I pressed against the bottom plate of the touchpad, the touchpad felt much better.  So I added a couple strips of electrical tape and sealed everything back up.  It was enough tape for the bottom cover to firmly press against the touchpad and now it is 99% better.

I would have easily given this laptop 5 stars, but because of this touchpad issue I'm only giving it 4.  If I could not have remedied that problem, I probably would have just returned the laptop and give it a 2 star rating.  I wouldn't recommend this fix for everyone since I probably voided my warranty.  But now that the touchpad doesn't clatter, I feel like its worth it.",first purchased laptop microsoft store instead amazon come bloat ware optimized window whatever mean really excited unbox laptop begin using immediately lightest thinnest laptop ever owned supposedly get hour battery life many review stated get lot bang buck moment laptop give gb ssd gb ram feature wished backlit keyboard primarily use laptop surfing web light word processing spreadsheet work working bed light backlit keyboard must run benchmark work done far gone smoothly one thing check battery life got hour use first charge happy since travel quite bit usually recharge battery run say previous laptop needed charging hour major improvement almost everything laptop perfect touchpad however drove crazy reason felt right click made noise pressing feel like clicked properly felt like touchpad loose made clattering noise every time pressed went back store checked demo unit touchpad demo unit firm tight fitting googled problem seems like others issue exchanged laptop another one problem exchanged one time rd laptop still problem really bummed return full refund really wanted keep computer every time clicked touchpad bothered searched fix came across website showed disassemble laptop fairly hopeful opened could easily fix issue electrical tape would tighten gap making touchpad behave way well gently opened back cover examined touchpad area lightly tapped around noticed pressed bottom plate touchpad touchpad felt much better added couple strip electrical tape sealed everything back enough tape bottom cover firmly press touchpad better would easily given laptop star touchpad issue giving could remedied problem probably would returned laptop give star rating recommend fix everyone since probably voided warranty touchpad clatter feel like worth,"04 29, 2015",APZSYRDSGZ8QX,Hilly,{'Style:': ' Prev Gen CPU/Win8/Grey'},Simple fix makes this a wonderful laptop,1430265600,False,12,1

283,4045,59135,59135,B000LP0R3E,,5.0,"I made the mistake of buying a replacement motherboard that didn't have all of the output ports needed for 7.1 speakers, and the only way to get the extra ports is if the case had them with a cable that was compatible with the motherboard.  Mine didn't.  Plus, the 2 speakers that did work popped when the system went to play a sound, which is much more annoying than you would think.  My biggest challenge was finding a sound card that worked well with Windows 7 64-bit, and this one fits the bill.

Having used the SoundBlaster Live before, I knew Creative Labs products were good.  Surprisingly, this card wasn't expensive so it became my low-cost solution to getting my extra speakers online again.  Installation was very easy, and I downloaded the latest drivers straight from Creative's web site before the card was delivered.  Everything installed without fuss.

I reviewed all of the default settings which seem more geared toward a low-end system.  I bumped it up to 24-bit and everything works great.  The sound is better than my previous on-board chipset.  I'm a bit particular about audio, so I do notice subtle differences between cards.  This has some extra options that I consider ""toys"" such as EAX sound effects like you're in an auditorium, hallway, stone cavern, toilet, etc.  But at least it does have them if that's your thing.

My system is a quad-core AMD Athlon II chip, 8GB of DDR3 RAM on a Gigabyte motherboard.  Use of the sound card doesn't affect CPU usage hardly at all, which is good.

I was lost on unfamiliar country roads and needed a hotel room the GPS feature on my phone was so exact that I could use it in my lane selections. I have not seen that in this unit yet. I have however found out that this thing is like having a tourguide! My wife and I enjoy taking off on the Harley and we often find ourselves in unfamiliar areas where we do not know what our options are for hotels and restaurants, the GPS gave us several options and we were able to find a place to eat that was good and a hotel when needed.
 We are planning another roadtrip and it was very easy to transfer all of the places and routes that we want to ride from the laptop (from Mapquest.com) to the GPS. I think that is a fantastic feature!
 One other con, is that there is quite a bit of glare off the screen on a sunny day, even in the car making it a little frustrating to follow directions.
 I do not look forward to up-dating the unit as it takes hours and slows down everything in the house that used the internet, but it is free, so I tolerate it.

I had to experiment with different headphones to find one that fit my ears and was stable, so this set may or may not work for you (but they are cheap enough to buy and try it out!).

2) Good sound quality. The Philips headphones had the best sound, but they kept falling out my ear holes when I ran so I couldn't hear the music anyway. These headphones are decent but maybe not the best out there, but considering the price it is a good deal.

3) Sweat doesn't seem to affect it. I had a pair of Sony earphones that would get muddled when I started to sweat and sometimes just completely shut off the sound. I have not had a single experience with these headphones yet like that after 1 year of heavy use (about 4 times/week).

It separates several strong FM stations in our area, something that even our larger, more expensive radios have trouble with. At night, in the bed, the signal is fine, even with the covers turning the unit around and the earphone cord/antenna being twisted and shortened.  AM band works well for size of the antenna and the memories are easy to set and use.  The battery life is great.
