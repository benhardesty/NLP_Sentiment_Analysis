4978,30702,30702,B000E39V9O,,3.0,"Our family switched over to using Skype to keep in contact.  Price was right, free, and voice quality was very good.  Video was inconsistent.

Didn't like being tied to the PC and then saw the DPH-50U and the ability to hook it into our wireless phone system (base stations plus 4 remotes).  $10 rebate made it $10 plus shipping, so took a chance even with the mixed reviews.

Worked great (downloaded the drivers per the reviews).  Sound is very good.  Dialing-out annoying (##001+number+*) but acceptable.  Seeing the Skype name on the caller ID of the remote phones was great.

Problem.  Uses up half the CPU on my admittedly aging 2.4Ghz Dell 8250. CPU shows right at 50%.  Turn the driver off and the CPU settles down to about 2%.  So I need half the horsepower of a reasonable PC to drive this thing?  No wonder it is cheap.  The PC is doing all the work.

Still not bad for the price but I can't just leave it on and forget about it.  I also can't just unplug it as while that drops the CPU back to 2%, plugging it back in causes the CPU to go to 100% and has locked up the PC at least once. I have to disable to driver to use my PC for anything CPU intensive.

So it is kind of a useful toy but I'll keep looking around for something more robust and less expensive in CPU power.

Update 10/17/08.  Moved the dph-50u over to my kids Dell E510, as it was slowing my PC down too much and they were away at school during the day so they wouldn't notice the slowdown.  However, with the E510 (3 GHZ, Pentium 4), there was NO slowdown. The CPU idles at about 2% and after making and receiving a few calls, the CPU load is still at 2%.  I checked the ""readme"" file to see if D-link had a recommended configuration, but there was no hint of what kind of PC it works best on (just CPU speed and memory are mentioned).  So your mileage may vary as to the load on your PC.  So I am optimistic and we'll see how it goes for awhile.",family switched using skype keep contact price right free voice quality good video inconsistent like tied pc saw dph u ability hook wireless phone system base station plus remote rebate made plus shipping took chance even mixed review worked great downloaded driver per review sound good dialing annoying number acceptable seeing skype name caller id remote phone great problem us half cpu admittedly aging ghz dell cpu show right turn driver cpu settle need half horsepower reasonable pc drive thing wonder cheap pc work still bad price leave forget also unplug drop cpu back plugging back cause cpu go locked pc least disable driver use pc anything cpu intensive kind useful toy keep looking around something robust le expensive cpu power update moved dph u kid dell e slowing pc much away school day notice slowdown however e ghz pentium slowdown cpu idle making receiving call cpu load still checked readme file see link recommended configuration hint kind pc work best cpu speed memory mentioned mileage may vary load pc optimistic see go awhile,"10 16, 2008",A314340R3JPOAX,Ecurb,,"Sound and operations good, CPU hog on PC",1224115200,True,,0

Firstly, these are super light and have a perfect fit. There are no gaps behind or below the ears. My big ears fit easily inside each cup with no compression. With some styles of headphones, the tension is great enough to give me a headache. These are snug enough to maintain a seal, but not tight enough to give me any discomfort.

The audible cues are clear and concise with power on and connecting. They connect very fast to devices. The firmware update process is painless and very quick (updated multiple minor versions in less than 5 minutes). The sound quality is second to none: deep bass with crisp highs. The sound dampening is very effective (I didn't hear my alarm go off and I didn't even have the volume up all the way). The microphone works very well with phone calls, Facetime, and WebEx without picking up ambient noise.

There are only a few drawbacks, but they're easily mutable. For one, when connected to two devices, sometimes the audio will get choppy. Bose is aware of the issue and is addressing it with firmware updates in the near future. There's an easy fix for it for now which is to simply disconnect from one of the devices and the sound quality returns to normal. The other issue I've noticed is the headphones show up with two outputs on my computer, which has caused issues initially with WebEx not choosing the correct output by default. Once you set that manually, it sticks.

As a kid, I was always teased about my big ears. I was shocked at how comfortable these headphones fit over my big ears.  I use them for roughly 5 hours a day at work and have no complaints.

They are well constructed with a great rubbery/plastic feel which is hardly a problem.  They are very easy to sync with any Bluetooth device and the features to answer and end phone calls if using a cell phone works great.  The only draw back I noticed is that when I answer a call using the phone and not the headphones, the music does not restart in the headphones but comes from the phone's speaker instead.  So, it's best to use the button on the headphones to answer and end calls.  As far as distance goes, I was able to walk 27 feet away from my phone before the music began to cut out.  I'm not sure how that stacks up against other Bluetooth headphones.

All of your standard inputs are here: DVI-D, VGA, and HDMI, along with a 3.5mm audio input. At 1920x1080, the picture is sharp enough at a distance of about 3 feet away. The colors are initially a little washed out from out of the box, but futzing with the settings produced a picture that I would consider optimal for competitive gaming (using DVI so far), along with the very low 2ms response time of the panel, it would serve any starting gamer with the best product for the money. My mother is using this for more screen space for work in her home office, which has passed with flying colors in her initial tests (web browsing, sorting through pictures, writing up product descriptions, publishing websites, etc.).

Pros:
Wide selection of inputs for 1080p sources
Very quick and easy setup out of the box (throw out the disk, you won't need it)
Well packaged and secure within the box
Included DVI-D and VGA cables in the box
Great response time
Relatively cheap for a good quality panel
Matte screen

Cons:
Colors are still a little washed out after messing with settings
Audio is horrible on the built-in speakers
Very shiny, fingerprint prone bezel (easily fixed with a quick wipe-down)

9584,388110,388110,B00XEW3YD6,,3.0,"I've been wanting an Eero for a long time, ever since it was first announced. The idea of having a mesh network just sounded so appealing. By the time that I finally got around to buying one, a couple of competitors had popped up. The most promising of them is the Luma. So, I actually bought both mesh routers and will proceed to review and compare them here (a copy of this review will be posted on both the Luma and the EERO product pages).

DESIGN
The Eero hardware is really awesome. As others have mentioned, it looks like something that Apple would design. Very glossy white and sleek looking. The routers are small squares that lie flat and have power and network cables coming out the back. There's also a USB, presumably for NSCs or printers. Eero also gave extra thought to maximizing radio antenna efficiency: the tops of the routers are modestly rounded to prevent users from putting glasses or other items on top of them (and thus obstructing strong signal).

The Luma hardware is pretty nice also. Actually, the honeycomb is pretty handsome on a bookshelf and I like that it comes in different colors. BUT, and this is a big bug, the Luma is meant to stand on edge. And, when the power and network cables are plugged in, it's unsteady. This doesn't matter too much if your first router is in the fiber closet, but it'll fall over somewhat often out in the open and look the eyesore.

Edge to Eero.

SETUP
I have Verizon FIOS fiber running at my home. Setup was pretty easy as I just plugged one end of a network RJ-45 cable into the ONT and then the other end directly into the ""first"" router. Luma apparently also allows for ethernet backhaul, but Eero doesn't at present. Regardlees, I don't use that feature so it's not relevent to me. Moreover, I doubt most buyers of this product will use it either. Anyway...

The Luma was set up first. Things went pretty smoothly. I downloaded the app from Android Play store and created an account with username and password. Remember to log into your old router and release the IP address for your ISP. Then I just followed the instructions on the app: powered down the old router, powered down the ONT (aka modem), plugged the network cable into the ONT and the Luma hub, and then plugged them both in. The Luma app on my Google Nexus 6P found the hub immediately, named it and asked me to sit patiently while it registered on the network. Sadly, that never happened. I tried one more time...no go. A quick search online revealed that some Android devices have difficulty. So, I tried setup with my Google Nexus 9 tablet and voila! It registered and I had wireless network. For the next two hubs, I used an old iPhone and things worked very smoothly also. So, perhaps it just didn't like my Nexus 6P. Small bug but no harm done.

The Eero set up was also smooth....after I figured out how to release my IP address on the Luma (see below). Basically, I had to power down the ONT and wait a couple hours. Once I did, setup with my Nexus 6P was quick this time round. Again, I downloaded the Eero app and created an account by entering my telephone number and then entering a 6 digit SMS code. The Eero hub was named, registered and had live internet. Good to go.

I'll call this a tie despite the Nexus 6P hiccup with Luma. But if you have a Nexus 6P and want to use a Luma, be prepared to need to try a different device for setup. If you're a stickler, edge to Eero.

THE APP INTERFACE
Right off the bat, both Eero and Luma apps are sparse. If you're used to configuring a wireless router in the past,  you will be unpleasantly surprised by the absence of desired features, including dynamic DNS, QoS, IP release, etc. However, I recognize that these devices are supposed to be family friendly and that they are. Following the instructions in both apps is super easy and very efficiently and quickly gets the first wifi puck up and running. NOTE: I must emphasize that the Verizon FIOS ONT needs to release the IP address in order to switch routers. If you don't release it, then you need to sit around for 2 hours with it powered down until does so automatically. This shouldn't affect most users who just buy either the Luma or the Eero. But, if you are planning on testing a couple devices, it's wise to remember.

Anyway, at this point, both apps look very similar and clean with their router status view, upload and download speeds and devices attached tab. Furthermore, they let you add new routers to the mesh network easily, name them (although Eero allows for custom names), reserve IP addresses (in advanced settings menus), enable port forwarding, assign wireless devices to a user profile, UPnP, etc. Here's where they differ:

The Eero app allows devices to be nicknamed (a super nice feature), allows for a custom DHCP, and allows DNS config if you want to use Google or OpenDNS or whomever.

The Luma can't do any of those at present. However, it does allow for IGMP Snooping to be enabled or disabled. Luma also offers a rating filter for all or specified users. I don't know what the movie-like ratings mean but it would seem handy if I had young kids to whom I wanted to restrict content.

In the end, they are both pretty similar. If I had to give one an edge, it would be the Eero simply because it allows nicknames for device connections. I dig that.

Minor edge to Eero.

SIGNAL
Okay, a lot of words to get to the part that matters most. How is the signal? Alas, this is really hard to quantify. Basically, I walked around all of the rooms in my home with the Wifi Analyzer app and took readings. On average, the Eero was about 2-5 db better than the Luma in each room. Having read some reviews online, perhaps it has to do with the extra 5Ghz antenna. Who knows? But, it was a pretty minor discrepancy and may have had more to do with how the hubs hand off the connection to one another (or don't) than actually signal strength. I will say this, BOTH Eero and Luma very capably covered all corners and rooms of my home. That alone is a tremendous victory compared to my sad history with range extenders that just never satisfied us at all.

So, minor edge to Eero but very satisfactory marks to both.

THROUGHPUT
After writing the above, a big surprise here. No bones about it but the Luma just clobbered the Eero. I have no explanation for this, especially after Eero's signal advantage. Basically, my devices would connect to the Eero hubs admirably and all looked well, achieving 120% of my Verizon FIOS bandwidth. But, after an hour or so, throughput would just plummet to about 10-30%. Badly. It made me crazy. Browsing was bad. Streaming was very difficult. My wife (who doesn't care about these tests at all) would complain and ask what I was doing to the network. I ensured that I was running the latest version but it didn't seem to resolve anything. I power-cycled everything. No success.

The Luma, on the other hand, functioned well. It would test at 100-120% of my FIOS bandwidth and almost always stay there, even if I ventured to far corners of the apartment. It made streaming on multiple devices, browsing, downloading, and music MUCH nicer than I have ever had in the past. And, the wife didn't complain. All is not rosy though. With some music sources, Luma needs a little attention. Sonos (Pandora and TuneIn Radio) ran into buffering pauses every so often. I'm hopeful that they can resolve this soon.

So, I don't have a good answer for why this was the case...especially since a lot of other users have raved about Eero. Perhaps the signal just doesn't steer my devices to the faster frequency connection. Candidly, even the 2.4GHz shouldn't have an issue. It was just curious.

Edge to Luma. But remember that you might not have this experience and I wasn't going to waste more than a weekend trying to nail down the issue.

PRICE
Because of the intro pricing for pre-ordering the Luma, it was $250 cheaper for me than the Eero. These devices are already pricey compared to traditional routers so it matters.

Edge to Luma.

FINAL RESULTS
Here's the rub, since Luma cost much less and functioned better, I just ended up keeping it. Yes, the little hexagons aren't as aesthetically pleasing but I can't have complaints about video quality on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Since we don't have cable, HD streaming is very important. So, while others have had good success with Eero, I just can't affirm their experiences. Unless you have extensive streaming requirements or network throughput needs, I think that Luma should suffice nicely. And for the price, it's a no brainer...even if it is only $100 less than the Eero now.

But, and it's a big but: both manufacturers really need to keep stepping it up in development. The apps and features are way too vanilla at present. Good signal and performance will only get you so far with more advanced users.

First, as others have noted, the low light performance is not good at all. I suppose the internal algorithms just get confused, but it's hard to get a good exposure in low light, and colors seem a fair amount off from both the human eye and my other cameras. The autofocus seems to ""hunt"" more than other cameras too, including my old Canon Powershot and the Lumix (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-Lumix-DMC-LX5-10-1-MP-Digital-Camera-with-3-8x-Optical-Image-Stabilized-Zoom-and-3-0-Inch-LCD-Black/dp/B003WJR69E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD - Black</a>) I got to replace it.

The image quality, even in normal light, is nothing special. The Lumix is quite a bit better, and this is certainly not in the same league as a DSLR. My Canon T3 is only 12 megapixel compared to 16 for this camera, and it takes much, much better shots.

This will do for casual photos, but I expect some of my travel photos to eventually end up in a book, so I need better quality than this camera seems to take. Other reviews say you can tweak this and that to get better quality, but I'm not willing to navigate the menus, because...

I found the interface to be pretty confusing. I eventually navigated through the menus to change the settings I needed, but it was unnecessarily complex and frustrating to do it. There's just no reason for a camera menu to have such a poorly designed user interface.

On the good side, it takes a lot of pictures on a charge, the zoom range is pretty good, and it's very compact. I like the auto lens cap, too. But that's not enough to balance the points I don't like about it.",terrible camera got enough annoyance take marginal quality photo decided give family member get something better travel camera first others noted low light performance good suppose internal algorithm get confused hard get good exposure low light color seem fair amount human eye camera autofocus seems hunt camera including old canon powershot lumix data hook product link linked class link normal href panasonic lumix dmc lx mp digital camera x optical image stabilized zoom inch lcd black dp b wjr e ref cm cr arp rvw txt ie utf panasonic lumix dmc lx mp digital camera x optical image stabilized zoom inch lcd black got replace image quality even normal light nothing special lumix quite bit better certainly league dslr canon megapixel compared camera take much much better shot casual photo expect travel photo eventually end book need better quality camera seems take review say tweak get better quality willing navigate menu found interface pretty confusing eventually navigated menu change setting needed unnecessarily complex frustrating reason camera menu poorly designed user interface good side take lot picture charge zoom range pretty good compact like auto lens cap enough balance point like,"12 21, 2011",A1EJ6J6N9I7W35,Billy Hollis,{'Color:': ' Black'},I'm annoyed enough that I got a Lumix as a replacement,1324425600,False,3,0

The look...
Excellent build quality.  The aluminum body is solid and looks clean and sharp, while the brown leather carrying handle with the white stitching provides a nice visual contrast. My wife looks on with envy...

The power...
Is it only 6 watts?  Plenty of volume for my usage.  The speaker generally sits on my desk in my office and is more than adequate for that.  When I leave it in my office and crank it up, it'll fill the downstairs with sound (we have an open floor plan) and I can jam out while slicing and dicing in the kitchen.  Sometimes the Veho joins me in my car (saves me from having to fix the non functional radio).  I have a compartment on top of my dash and the speaker fits nicely in there allowing it to do what it does...play the tunes that tickle my ear drums.

The sound profile...
Certainly more subjective and personal, however for my ears the Veho produces very good sound.  My main audio input is my HTC One.  I stream Pandora quite a bit and the speaker provides well balanced audio, though a little more bass would be appreciated.  When I play my local tunes stored on my HTC via the n7player app I can use the EQ and various other settings to tinker with the sound.  This approach lets me boost the low end for some thump, without distortion.

Other items...
One minor beef here is that the on/off/incoming call beep is real loud - almost annoyingly so.
When operating off the plug, the battery life has been good.
Bluetooth connectivity works well with no connection issues, and distance is as advertised.

I've now switched to Harmony 650 as my main remote.  Really enjoy it.

 Hardware quality and ergonomics:  5
Just feels right in the hand. Lightweight.  Buttons are well placed, response is easy, springy.  Screen is very readable.  Backlit fixed buttons.  Sleek appearance.  High build quality.

 Price:  5
Downright cheap for a quality universal remote.  Most are priced multiple times higher.

 Software:  4
Stable. Attractive features.  Learning curve was longer than expected (6 sessions so far).  Lots of custom options, plus individual button programming and learning of buttons from your old remote.  Some features are locked down with no customization, yet there's still enough flexibility to do a lot.  My chief complaint was having to program by hand each button of my blu-ray player; though I selected its model from the database, Harmony decided each button (left, right, up, down, pause, play, FF, rewind, chapter prev/next) should control my TV rather than my blu-ray player.  I came back to the PC, examined the programming, and manually reprogrammed each blu-ray button, twice (once for ""Activities,"" then once again for ""Device"" control for the same player).  Hey, at least a workaround was supported.

Getting past that annoyance, ""Activities"" works beautifully for simple or complex sequences.  For instance:  my older AV receiver lacks HDMI, so I use ""Activities"" to select its audio input channel, plus a matching HDMI choice from an external switcher, plus a TOSlink optical audio channel.  Harmony 650 manages this seamlessly.

At this price, I bought a spare.  Harmony software syncs programming to the first remote, then syncs the same settings to the spare.  Nice.

Really appreciate how the most frequently used buttons (play, pause, reverse, FF, record, stop) are located near the base, where your hand holds the remote.  (Oddly, Harmony's more expensive models such as the Ultimate One, place those frequently used buttons at the top where it seems you would need two hands to use it - one to hold the remote near the base, the other to push pause/play/rewind, etc.)

Hope my tips help as you shop for your universal remote.

Harmony 650 helped me add a new Roku Ultra player to an older universal remote.  (Roku Ultra comes with an RF remote but can accept IR commands from a universal remote.)  From the Harmony 650 database, I selected Roku Ultra, then taught its IR commands to my older remote.

Funny that I would buy such a high-end TV since I am not a TV watcher, cable and DSL are not even available where I live and I do not have Dish or anything other than a cheap antenna which brings in a handful of local stations.

I mainly use the TV as a computer monitor, being a photographer/videographer. One video camera I have shoots in 3D. I've been using TVs like that since before smart TVs existed. I do not connect the TV to the Internet except to update the OS now and then.

I have watched 2 3D movies on this though and they look great as do 2D. I would have liked the flat screen model but as others have said this is not a very extreme curve and most of the time I do not think about it.

Having said all that, after watching this I realize what a good one my ""old"" Panasonic HD 3DTV is... after 3 years. This one outshines it a bit but considering everything the one I replaced is amazing also and might not sell it because I doubt I'd get what I think it is worth.

This was for a rather active vacation in Costa Rica. Took it snorkeling- great pictures! ( I felt that as great as 10ft depth was , I wanted to have the option to go deeper than that so the 33ft depth was important to me. I did on more than one occasion swim down past 10 ft.) Took it white water rafting on class III/IV rapids ( even fell out acouple of times), great pictures. Zip lining, Horseback riding & hiking in the rainforest- worked perfectly! It was small enough to keep handy all the time, whatever we were doing. I even dropped it, accidently, on the tarmac at the airport, did not affect it at all.

 I am pressed by this little camera. It does alot. Even shot video, even more fun!
 Here's what accessories I got with it so I'll reccomend this stuff, whether through amazon or not. If you are planning an active vacation / lots of pictures:
2 gb XD card. Plenty of room for pictures and video.
silicone skin- Get this for an active vacation, it's pretty easy to take on and off, gives the camera a better grip and another layer of protection, and guards against scratching the casing.
 An extra battery!  I highly reccomend this  with any camera , but  certainly with this one, not that it burns through the battery, but if your in the middle of the costa rica jungle taking lots of great pictures, having an extra battery simply means you can continue to take pictures, and not miss any great shots! Because you will take a lot more pictures wit hthis camera, simply becasue you can do so much with it.
 I also got an adjustable neoprene wrist strap as an added measure- just to be safe with all of the bouncing around, I wanted to make sure I didn't lose this nifty little camera! It comes with a little string strap, which in may cases would work, okay.

If I had to give it a gripe, the 3x zoom is a little restricitng, but I am also used to the larger zoom lenes on my SLR.

It's great to be able to switch between wired and wireless and have used that feature several times. Given that I'm left-handed, ambidextrous mice are the only ones I tolerate. This is as close to an ""everything mouse"" I could find on the market (ambidextrous, Bluetooth 4, side buttons for gaming).
CONS: My only real complaint is that the it feels a little too small. I think my hand rests better on an HP x4000b (but I ditched for lack of side buttons). There have been a few cases where this has caused me to accidentally hit the side buttons. This has yet to affect a game I've played or my regular web surfing. I imaging I'm ""holding it wrong"" and I'll get into a habit that prevents that from happening at all. In the mean time, I'll just imagine this mouse as a little too short to get all 5 stars.
NOTES: The cord feels a little flimsy, but, given the nylon cover I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for durability. In any case, it's a universal micro USB port so it should be easy to fashion a replacement if they disappear from the internet before I move on to another mouse.",pro using orochi week like great able switch wired wireless used feature several time given left handed ambidextrous mouse one tolerate close everything mouse could find market ambidextrous bluetooth side button gaming con real complaint feel little small think hand rest better hp x b ditched lack side button case caused accidentally hit side button yet affect game played regular web surfing imaging holding wrong get habit prevents happening mean time imagine mouse little short get star note cord feel little flimsy given nylon cover give benefit doubt durability case universal micro usb port easy fashion replacement disappear internet move another mouse,"08 9, 2016",A3014ILFNHU38L,AlwaysSonny,,Big things come in small packages...,1470700800,True,,1

I was actually expecting this flash drive to be the same size as the Kingston drive which is about 2 inches long..the perfect size for inserting and extracting flash drives from a USB port.
This Transcend drive is about exactly the size of a common bluetooth dongle like those used for cordless mice, etc. At that size, the flash drive is super easy to misplace, and is a real pain to get in and out of a USB slot, especially if like me, your hands are somewhat arthritic.

5202,725615,725615,B00ATGTFII,,4.0,"I bought this lightbox expecting something cheap that I'd have to 'deal with' and hope wouldn't break too soon, but I've been really pleasantly surprised.

The biggest issue with softboxes in this price range is that they don't stay together. Spend a couple hundred bucks and you'll get one with an umbrella mechanism inside that you can let up and down in a second. With this one, you have to mess around, sticking bendy arms into speedring holes, and it can seem like quite a chore, but once you've worked out a routine step-by-step method for doing it, it's not too bad. If I was going to using it a lot over several subsequent days, I'd just leave it togther.

The other minor issue is the way the front diffuser attaches. It wraps around the outside edges of the sofbox. That means you're not going to be able to easily get a grid on there. With more expensive boxes, the front panel is recessed when attached, so the eggshell grid can sit in front of it. Not that this box has a grid you can buy. You'd have to make it. So if you're thinking about doing a DIY grid for this, bear that in mind.

The softbox comes with some cool accessories. It fits on a speedring, so you get one of those. You also get a speedlight adapter for speedring, which is a nice piece of gear. It attaches to your lightstand via an impressively solid ball head, which combined with the rotation ability of the speed ring gives you lots of position flexibility.

I highly recommend this softbox, but only give 4 stars because it can be a pain to set up and take down, and I do have some mild concerns about how long the flexible arms will retain their spring and work as well as they do now.",bought lightbox expecting something cheap deal hope break soon really pleasantly surprised biggest issue softboxes price range stay together spend couple hundred buck get one umbrella mechanism inside let second one mess around sticking bendy arm speedring hole seem like quite chore worked routine step step method bad going using lot several subsequent day leave togther minor issue way front diffuser attache wrap around outside edge sofbox mean going able easily get grid expensive box front panel recessed attached eggshell grid sit front box grid buy make thinking diy grid bear mind softbox come cool accessory fit speedring get one also get speedlight adapter speedring nice piece gear attache lightstand via impressively solid ball head combined rotation ability speed ring give lot position flexibility highly recommend softbox give star pain set take mild concern long flexible arm retain spring work well,"06 23, 2014",A2UZ9Q4VIBMHN4,Dennis,,"Excellent, with minor issues, and surprisingly good accessories",1403481600,True,2.0,1

I use this with a Motorola Razr HD Maxx from 2012.

5 star scale.

Fit = *****
Lightweight, fits comfortably, forget you have it on. I am 6ft, 200 lbs. Not huge. Not small. Normal non-George Lopez style head.  Do not be concerned with the size of the discs over your ears like I was. They are small. Not as small as just earbuds. (though they have nice earbuds with two sets of comfortable rubber covers. People can see they are different, but not ridiculously so. People have told me they like the way they look. The discs do not make your ears feel covered or warm. For me that would be a deal breaker in hot weather. These are fine. The disc size makes the controls very ergonomic.  I wear these with no additional support and they DO NOT fall out.

Battery Life = *****
Suites my needs. I run twice for 35 minutes on the weekend. Then I charge it and put it away. Take it out a week later and get 2 runs out of it with power to spare.

Sweatproof = *****
So far so good.  I have had 2 very expensive Motorola S11 fail on me due simply to sweat while running. The design of these seems to keep sweat off important parts pretty well. They have not died yet on some very sweaty runs. I am hopeful. Will update on how these hold up. So far so good.

Ergonomics, controls, buttons = ****
This is one of the best parts of the design. The buttons are REALLY well placed and very easy to access to raise/lower volume or change tracks while running. Pause is so-so, but might be my phone. Sometimes it doesn't pause. Sometimes that starts another music player. Amazon MP3 player doesn't seem to have a setting to tell it not to respond to headset and keeps coming up. Sometimes pause is just ignored.
Starts up, shuts down, pairs readily when button is pressed as directed.

Pairing =  *****
Easy, no hassle pairing.

Reception = *****
When I wear on my right arm as directed, NEVER drops. My moto dropped consistently, but maybe had it on wrong arm. Never tried other one.  If I put this one on my left arm, drops sound like moto.

Sound Quality = ***
Sound is Okay. I can get by with it. Reliability with the sweat issue, makes the sound tolerable. Better so-so sound than no sound.  That said, seems to have limited range. Base is not all that powerful. Treble is better, even so, everything seems to lack dimension.  The $100 Moto S11 blew these away as did my Moto HT820, but for the price and what these are. They are passible. I may look into whether Jaybirds sound better. Will be keeping these though as a nice utility headset.

Call Quality = ****
I am shocked to say that these things don't do too badly on calls. Thus far, no one has complained that they cannot hear me. In that regard, they are better than my S11's which people would always immmediately let me know they couldn't understand me.  I gave them a 4 star on this because I did get a little feedback that I wasn't sounding completely clear.

1414,73232,73232,B000V4VGAI,,4.0,"My wife and I are avid GPS users.  We have a Garmin n&uuml;vi 750, which we love.  We also have a GPS function in both of our phones (Samsung and Blackberry).  The GPS units we have and use are street-level GPS units.  They do not function in the least ""off road.""

So, needless to say, this product functions entirely differently than the ones we are used to.  It DOES supposedly contain a ""points of interest"" function (which I believe is the ""Trips"" function which ships disabled in the unit because it was apparently not ready when the unit shipped) which can find stores, etc.  The unit also doesn't ship with street-level maps, or the ability to program house/business addresses into it.  So, out of the box, it is a hiker's/explorer's GPS unit.  That is fine, that is clearly its intended function.

The basic functions of ""where am I"" and GPS coordinate location and reporting work wonderfully.  However, the AA alkaline batteries it comes with don't last very long.  You are certainly going to want to spring for high capacity lithium batteries.

It also has a built in flashlight (which is rather difficult to turn on).  It also includes an integrated camera (not very powerful) and an MP3 player and headphone jack.  Finally, it includes a barometer and compass (never used them).  All of the elements of the unit are covered in heavy rubber covers -- which is actually a problem for the memory card slot, it is actually rather difficult to get the card in.

In terms of functionality, the location functions were excellent.  I was able to set GPS coordinates randomly, mark them down, wander around on the river bike trail, and come back to them days later and find the exact same coordinates, at the exact same place.  Not bad at all.  During the time I was testing it, I didn't have time to take it for an actual nature hike, but it seems to know where it is, and where it is going.

I checked out their website, and the Natural Geographic ""topo"" maps seem pretty nice, and I think if I am going to use the unit on a real hiking trip, I would want them.  I would also like them to unlock the ""Trips"" feature as well.

Overall, the unit is sturdy, it knows where it is, and I think it would be a handy thing to have with you when camping or hiking.  I fully plan to put it into the camping/emergency kit.  It is sturdy, is works, and that is enough.

For the negatives, the menu is cramped and confusing.  The documentation is terrible, and EXTREMELY short, and not at all helpful (their website is much more helpful).  The extras outside of the main functions are not really all that needed or wanted, and they are battery drainers.  Not a bad product.  It could be better, but it isn't bad.  For the price they want, I would expect them to unlock the ""Trips,"" and also load some basic street level maps into it.  Even if you are camping/hiking, being able to find the General Store at the local town would certainly be helpful.

Stuff I like about this product
- Easy setup
- No need for cables to transfer pictures
- My wife can now upload pictures to shutterfly without me telling her she's doing it wrong :)
- My pictures are organized automatically by shooting date without the need for the clunky canon software to do it.

Stuff I don't like about this product
- Most settings have to be changed from the PC, with the card connected.  I can't make changes to it from my camera's screen.
- SD card dongle is rather large, would be better to use a corded USB design or ship with a USB cord to attach to it.

Overall, excellent product.  I like knowing that I can back up pictures from virtually anywhere, any time.  An example of how this is great, picture yourself on a honeymoon.

It also has the picture frame feature which is kind of a nice (if a bit odd) addition.  But unfortunately, it's not exactly plug & play.

I'm not an IT guy but I got my MBA with an emphasis in Information Systems and I've handled the IT needs for small companies I've worked for (outsourcing the tougher stuff), but all that's been a few years ago and I really haven't needed to keep up on technology much since then.  So, while I'm not an expert I probably know just enough to get myself into trouble.  I've installed other wireless home routers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Link-DIR-825-Xtreme-N-Dual-Band/dp/B001F7HLRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D-Link DIR-825 Xtreme N Dual Band</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Linksys-WRT54G/dp/B00007KDVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Linksys WRT54G</a>) and they were almost plug & play.  Unfortunately, this one didn't go as smoothly.

We have broadband access through our cable provider and it was difficult to get this router to work with it, but working through the setup process on the computer solved the initial connectivity problems.  The picture frame is a nice extra feature, but the screen is so small that it seems almost pointless.  The FrameChannel option makes good use of it, though, and you can subscribe to weather, news, comics, etc., as well as have your own photos cycling.  The weather and photos were the only really worthwhile options to me, however, as the comics I selected ended up so small they couldn't be read and the news wasn't local (tons of options but nothing relevant to me).  But at least it allows you to keep the router on top of the desk or otherwise out in the open, although it didn't have as good of range as we had before (we placed the other routers *under* the desk and still got much better range).

My biggest complaint is with staying connected to the internet.  We continually had problems both on the desktop computer connected directly to the router as well as connecting wirelessly with the laptop - and sometimes one would work and the other wouldn't.  The internet would randomly drop off and later come back online, and the speed on the wireless connection was inconsistent - usually extremely fast but sometimes excruciatingly slow.

  The quality of the raw file is as good as and better then some of the micro 4/3rd's. You will not have the shallow DOF but buy a full frame for that or do it in PS.
  You have to compare apples to apples. The price might seem a bit high right now but if you buy it with the 10mm prime like I did you only pay 150 dollars for that lens. It's a lovely lens too. Sharp at f2.8 and stellar at f4. The kit 10-30 zoom is really quite good.
  I purchased both the V1 and J1. I decided to keep the J1. I don't use a view finder and wanted something smaller to take instead of my DSLR. Both camera's are nice. Build quality is great and the high iso raw files are on par with DSLR's of a few years ago.
  I would have liked the controls for settings to be buttons and not in the menu. If you want a small high quality camera with images to match and the option to put on a new Nikon lens down the road this is a great choice. Search on 500px for Nikon 1 V1 and see what some great photographers are doing with these little Nikons.

If you value audiophile level sound but don't want to overpay I suggest you check this sound bar out.  Additionally, built in Bluetooth and numerous sound settings allow a great deal of placement flexibiiity.

Installation and setup were easy.  Unpack the sound bar, set it on a table, plug the digital optical cable into it from your source device, plug in the sound bar power cord and use the remote control to power it up.  That's it.  Ten minutes  max.  I'm using this with an LG PF1500 HD Projector which projects 110 inch picture on my living room wall.  I found a short stand to place the soundbar on and it sits out of the way below the wall.  Quite a compact setup which plays music and movies with amazing dynamic range on a very large screen.

The dynamic range, highs, mid range, and low end are finely balanced.  I don't see the need for a subwoofer but an output is available.  Music sounds very good and movies sound fantastic considering this is not a full 5.1 surround system.  Trust me on this.  In my basement I have an expensive 7.1 component sound system connected to a 65inch TV.  That system is state-of-the-art but requires a lot of real estate and wiring.  The SB500 can't compare in terms of surround capabilities but sonically it gets the job done with little wiring and lots less work.

As you may know, ZVOX has several features which help refine and tune the sound output and they all work as expected.  I tend to leave the settings neutral but with a slight bass level boost because of my large room.  Surround settings 1 or 2 work best in my room.  This soundbar turns itself on when a signal comes through the optical cable and turns off after about 15 minutes with no signal.  A very useful feature.  Would I like to have a $1500 B&W or Paradigm sound bar?  Sure.  I simply can't justify it knowing this sound bar comes close at one-fourth the price.

4045,59135,59135,B000LP0R3E,,5.0,"I made the mistake of buying a replacement motherboard that didn't have all of the output ports needed for 7.1 speakers, and the only way to get the extra ports is if the case had them with a cable that was compatible with the motherboard.  Mine didn't.  Plus, the 2 speakers that did work popped when the system went to play a sound, which is much more annoying than you would think.  My biggest challenge was finding a sound card that worked well with Windows 7 64-bit, and this one fits the bill.

Having used the SoundBlaster Live before, I knew Creative Labs products were good.  Surprisingly, this card wasn't expensive so it became my low-cost solution to getting my extra speakers online again.  Installation was very easy, and I downloaded the latest drivers straight from Creative's web site before the card was delivered.  Everything installed without fuss.

I reviewed all of the default settings which seem more geared toward a low-end system.  I bumped it up to 24-bit and everything works great.  The sound is better than my previous on-board chipset.  I'm a bit particular about audio, so I do notice subtle differences between cards.  This has some extra options that I consider ""toys"" such as EAX sound effects like you're in an auditorium, hallway, stone cavern, toilet, etc.  But at least it does have them if that's your thing.

My system is a quad-core AMD Athlon II chip, 8GB of DDR3 RAM on a Gigabyte motherboard.  Use of the sound card doesn't affect CPU usage hardly at all, which is good.

If you're looking for a good, budget sound card that is compatible with Windows 7 64-bit, you will very likely be happy with this.",made mistake buying replacement motherboard output port needed speaker way get extra port case cable compatible motherboard mine plus speaker work popped system went play sound much annoying would think biggest challenge finding sound card worked well window bit one fit bill used soundblaster live knew creative lab product good surprisingly card expensive became low cost solution getting extra speaker online installation easy downloaded latest driver straight creative web site card delivered everything installed without fuss reviewed default setting seem geared toward low end system bumped bit everything work great sound better previous board chipset bit particular audio notice subtle difference card extra option consider toy eax sound effect like auditorium hallway stone cavern toilet etc least thing system quad core amd athlon ii chip gb ddr ram gigabyte motherboard use sound card affect cpu usage hardly good looking good budget sound card compatible window bit likely happy,"02 24, 2011",A53CILMCOOH3R,EdFromOhio,,A solid sound card for Windows 7 64-bit,1298505600,True,6,1

I decided to try it out and have been very happy with it.  I have the Kindle and Nook apps downloaded into my Le Pan so this has reinforced my decision to go with the Le Pan II.  I also love that there is an app (free I might add) that is compatible with Microsoft Office (word, pp, excel, etc) which makes it very convenient for me to do school papers when I am not at home.
There are so many apps to choose from.  The android technology is very easy to get accustomed to.  I had a set back when trying to download my music, but as long as you use Google Music to sync (can be used with iTunes) and then make sure to mark the music as being accessible offline...all is good.
I love that it will accept up to a 32GB memory card which expands the memory capabilities tremendously.  I think the only two things I would add is a camera on the back (in addition to the one on the front) and a USB slot that will accept thumb drives.  I know there is the microSD card slot, but having a thumb drive would make backing up work a little easier when in a rush.
I have played Netflix and it is awesomely clear and no lag time.  As long as there is internet available (wifi) the connection and response time are great.  Would also love to see an internet slot meant for mobile internet as well as see Le Pan offer a great monthly internet on the go subscription.  You know, maybe something that is like a wireless air card that could be inserted for anywhere access to internet...maybe the new Le Pan (future) tablets should have two thumb drives...one for memory back up and one for internet access ($10 a month would be awesome...hint, hint).  I would much rather prefer to take and use my Le Pan on the go rather than my laptop computer.
I know there will be many tweeks and updates as customers list their likes and don't likes.  I am 100% satisfied with my tablet and don't even think of an iPad or any other tablet now.  This was exactly (and more) what I wanted and will be staying with Le Pan from now on.

I found this system after hours upon hours of research and comparisons and decided that I would try this one.
My decade old Sony DAV S300 300 watts died on me and I was looking for a decent replacement, well, here it is.

I have never been disappointed with Samsung products and this one knocks it out the park.

I am sort of an audiophile but I did not want to spend more than $300 on a system.

What I like:
- The bass hits all ranges from low to mid to high and does it exceptionally well
- Has subwoofer control level
- Speakers are mountable with just plain old thumbtacks! - Huge plus
- Quick and easy setup
- Has an optical input
- The satellites provide crisp clear sound, no complaints
- Could hear my music from outside the house just on a 20 volume

What I dislike
- The wires for the front left and front right are a little short. This is due to how a surround sound is meant to be setup which is near the tv. I would say these wires are more than 7' long. The rear left and right speakers are double that maybe a little longer than 14'.

I was really excited to finally find an iPod clock radio that I thought  met all my specifications -- no overly bright display to keep me awake at night, nice design, not to big a footprint and with a detachable speaker to give a nice stereo sound.  Then, came the reality.  After working with it for a few weeks, I found out that it does not do the one thing I wanted most --  an alarm that accesses the next track on my iPod nano each morning.  Instead, it simply accesses my songs list and starts at the beginning of that list every morning.  I would have been better off keeping my CD clock radio and just changing the CD each day to get some variety.

I contacted XtremeMac for tech support.  They said they had no reports of such a problem and could only suggest I download an alarm app (which doesn't apply to the nano ) and that they would check further to see it they could find a solution and get back to me in about a week (which I did not wait for less I lose the opportunity to return the radio for a refund).  I also did an online search to see if I could find info to resolve the problem on  my own.  No such luck!  The only stuff I could find applied to the iPhone and iPod touch; nothing for the nano!

Then I discovered that I could return it due to Amazon's generous holiday returns policy and that's what I did.

If you have an iPhone or iPod touch, my problem may not apply to you because the alarm app may resolve the problem I had.  But my advice would be to check to make sure the radio works as it is supposed to within the time frame for returning it so that you aren't stuck with a pretty but not-as-expected device!",first say two star rating applies radio amazon usual get five star really excited finally find ipod clock radio thought met specification overly bright display keep awake night nice design big footprint detachable speaker give nice stereo sound came reality working week found one thing wanted alarm access next track ipod nano morning instead simply access song list start beginning list every morning would better keeping cd clock radio changing cd day get variety contacted xtrememac tech support said report problem could suggest download alarm app apply nano would check see could find solution get back week wait le lose opportunity return radio refund also online search see could find info resolve problem luck stuff could find applied iphone ipod touch nothing nano discovered could return due amazon generous holiday return policy iphone ipod touch problem may apply alarm app may resolve problem advice would check make sure radio work supposed within time frame returning stuck pretty expected device,"01 29, 2012",ASEPEDRM9P9CD,E.

9734,230234,230234,B0053DDNW6,,4.0,"I mean, for this price, how could I get upset? Everything but the memory is included in the package. The camera works just as expected, picture quality is adjustable but sacrifices storage space as expected. I've viewed video from night and day drives and it shows up phenomenally! I even captured my entire encounter with a stranded drunk driver who needed a jump which turned into me giving him a lift to a local bar. Audio quality is perfect for picking up any and every sound you need to hear, and the image is great! I can't complain getting all this in this very inexpensive package.

I've had it for a year or two now and here are some of the cons I've noticed. When you first set everything up the whole menu and everything is in Chinese or something so you have to click and guess how to change it to English, I got lucky! Also over time the battery (much like a phone battery) doesn't hold charge very well anymore mostly because it's best to always keep it plugged in anyway which seems to be constantly charging the battery... bad setup. It does turn on/off automatically but if you don't have outlets in your car that activate with startup/shut down of the car then you have to manually hold down the button and listen for a beep to say it's off. Lately it's been taking a long time to confirm it is on. Also it has dropped off the windshield once and every since then the screen doesn't stay in the fully up position, it's always slightly open, really annoying at night because you can see the light of the screen in the opening and with my top down, it's really noticeable at a distance. Another big downfall for me is that in order to mount it to the top of a windshield hanging down maximizing inconspicuousness and being out of the way of anything else including visibility (which is impossible considering how much space it takes up with all the linkages) you can only screw it down by about one thread which poses a threat of falling down all the time. If you bought it and tried mounting it this way you'll see exactly what I'm saying but the camera itself mounts onto a coarse thread and there's a locking nut above that to keep it tight. Great for other positions but certainly without that locking nut I would not be able to mount this in my car unless I block some of my vision. Not an option considering my car has such limited windshield as it is. Also if you leave it on for too long, like several days, it will get jammed up and stops recording causing you to have to disconnect all power from the unit to get it to function properly again.

Like I said, for the price, this is all very easy to look past, I've had it for about 2 years I think and it still does the job very well. I've caught some funny stuff on this thing and idiot drivers more than anything. Thankfully no accidents, but I know it's there just in case. Gonna upgrade to a $100 unit now that I've got the feel for owning such a thing and love it! If you're wondering if you should spend your money on it, YES!

The built in level gets you on the right track and the ability to easily rotate the screen after a few degrees right or left allows for perfect alignment.
It also gives you the flexibility of sliding the TV left or right a few inches to adjust centering and location. This mount is very strong with no play. The movement of articulation is very smooth and easily done. Almost feels as though they used ball bearings in the hinges but I doubt that.
After reading others reviews I decided not to chance using the lag bolts that come included and so I bought my own at Lowes.
The instructions advise to use a 5/32 drill bit for the pilot holes but that would be way too tight. After researching proper pilot hole sizes for a 5/16"" bolt I went with a 7/32"" pilot and this proves to be perfect. Very snug to the point I had to use a wrench to tighten all the way but not too tight where I was worried about the bolt snapping.

8916,37759,37759,B000A6LSVY,,5.0,"Let me preface this review by stating that I've been a fan of Microsoft hardware (primarily mice & keyboards) for some time now.  I'm not die-hard a MS fan by any means (heck I prefer Unix over Windows for most uses), but I have to admit they've done a decent job at making computer hardware.  I especially like their ergonomic keyboards and optical mice.  I know many people prefer Logitech's products, but I'm not a gamer, so Microsoft's input devices suit me just fine.

I thought I bought the holy grail of mice when I upgraded to the Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 about a year ago, so much so that I got the notebook version for my laptop not long after.  So I was skeptical about the level of improvement on these new-fangled laser mice, and hadn't planned on buying one.

However, I never really cared for the snap-in receiver on my Wireless Notebook Mouse 3000.  It is designed to be adjustable so that the end of the receiver can be repositioned to different angles for the best wireless reception.  Unfortunately, this design also makes the receiver come loose easily when stored in the bottom of the mouse, causing it to turn on frequently while not in use--draining battery life.  So I decided to give the MS Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000 a try, as it comes with a fixed receiver that doesn't move.

I was blown away by how much better the laser notebook mouse tracks.  It is surprisingly more precise and accurate than the previous mouse devices.  It's hard to understand the improvement until you've tried one.  The mouse is extremely responsive, and makes other non-laser mice feel like heavy paperweights in comparison.  The laser is not just a gimmicky marketing trick, it really makes for a better mouse!  I subsequently bought the Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 for my desktop, and am experiencing the same level of improvement there as well.  It feels terrific in my hand, and I like the fact that it can also run on one AA battery (like other MS wireless mice I've used) for a reduced weight.

The only drawback is that the laser is invisible, as I miss the red light on the bottom of my old mouse sometimes (but not enough to go back to the old mouse!).  Also, I would rather have a black receiver than the more standout silver color.  I experimented and found that the laser mouse will work with the black wireless receiver for the Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0, but scrolling doesn't work as well, so I'm sticking with the silver receiver.

This is the second extension cable from 2 different sellers, brands I have bought on Amazon. My Microsoft webcam worked perfect in windows 7 and 8 solo and with the cable.
In the past using a HP computer 8.1, the cables did not work. Video shows how it looked in the past before this problem was fixed. I tried everything and still did not work until recently.

Now in Jan, 2015 I bought a different brand of computer with newest 8.1, did a few uninstall, reinstall; Now the cable works and the video is perfect! I can use the webcam, cable with HD highest resolution... and is nice and clear, fast.

It also works very well for audio using a old mic I bought at the thrift store or any mic.

Also; trying different ports to plug in the cable helped and it seems Microsoft updated the cord software, driver.

So; if you get the problem I show in the video; try a few different setups, upgrades... There is something new out there that fixed this problem.

First off, these are not the type of stylus that are dual function as a writing pen (which personally are my favorites!). I still gave these a 5 star rating though because of all my stylus pens I've owned that are dual functioning, they don't work on my tablet.

I have been wanting a stylus that will work well on my HTC One M8 as well as our Google Nexus 7 2013 tablet and this one fits the bill! I actually ordered one just for the tablet and it cost more than this one but this Fenix stylus pleasantly surprised me!...

Very pretty shade of metallic purple with a soft lavender tip. This stylus works best when used lightly, like a paint brush, otherwise, like many stylus, it can catch some drag.

I love that I don't need to apply any pressure and it works well on both my phone and tablet. This makes it my favorite stylus (it just needs an ink function)! Smile.

It has a metal tip with a hole for a cell phone loop or wrist lanyard and a pen clip so you can attach the stylus to a pocket or notebook.

The length is a bit shorter than others I own but I find it to be sufficient and like how lightweight it is.

It's also a bit thicker than other stylus pens and I didn't expect to like that but it feels comfortable to grip. Definitely a matter of personal preference!

I've been using this stylus for about a month and gave the other two to friends. This stylus also looks especially cute with my phone case, lol, so I'll likely be buying some soon. The current price ($4.99) for the 3 are extremely reasonable, in my opinion!

A laptop can do all of this but they usually don't have a 6-12 hour battery life (even longer on some days).
This is not a mac/windows computer so it doesn't have a ton of offline apps. These are not meant for that.
If you see a negative reviews about chromebooks because they ""don't do enough offline"" then these reviewed barely read through the purpose of these machines. I heard friends tell me my chromebook is useless unless it's online but what about their laptops? Can't they say the same? I have a gaming desktop at home so I don't need another laptop with windows on it....
They are meant to browse online, some offline, last longer and use less resources=faster!
There are ways to even install Lunix ubuntu on these computers, if you want to add more software.

8137,145315,145315,B004RTE5EC,,3.0,"A couple of years ago, I received this 59"" TV as a replacement for a Samsung 58"" 3-D TV bought in 2011, which was a nightmare.  This was after three service orders and writing to the Office of the President, presenting a formal complaint.

The good things about the Sammy PN59D8000: Slim modern design.  Great picture quality especially with B/R 3-D. Wide viewing angle.  Removable base that allows wall mounting.  Plenty of inputs and outputs.

The bad things about the Sammy PN59D8000:
* Internal speakers sound is mediocre making you need an external device for proper audio listening, especially with the high and low bass frequencies.
* Optical and sound digital output do not provide the 5.1 sound advertised.  You need an Amplifier/Receiver/Surround Bar Decoder to get the full 5.1 effect.  I have it with a 7.2 thanks to an Onkyo amplifier and supplemental speakers and sub-woofers.
* TV Outputs; HDMI and USB will not allow you to see or record TV programs as advertised by Samsung.  Note that Samsung's website even advertised specific storage devices made by WD to save recorded programs.
* Even though mislead, as of March 2014, the TV still does not have the capability of installing the Amazon Prime TV feature for those of us who are subscribed.  You might need to buy a Roku or a Google Chrome to get Amazon Prime movies.
* The Remote Control is a nightmare and a battery drainer.  Mine was replaces twice and ended up getting a Logitech complementary RC to be able to properly program recordings on the TV.
* The 3-D features are cumbersome as even though you need to wear the 3-D glasses included, it is a nightmare.  Samsung TVs have three separate settings for watching 3-D.  Horizontal, diagonal or side to side depending on the source.  The major problem is that if you are watching a 3-D  movie on any of the formats and you pause it, even with the glasses, you need to return the TV to the original 2-D format to even read/see what is next.  Crazy!!!
* As all Plasma TVs, this Sammy Plasma gets the room very warm, unlike my old Sony LCD Bravia from 2005 which does not generate any heat at all and after almost a decade, still works perfectly.

Thus, if you have read my review up to this part, consider getting a Panasonic, a Sony LCD or even an LG TV.  Have seen all these three and much better and cheaper alternatives than the Samsung PN59D8000 3-D Plasma.  As of March 2014, 3-D TV features are not worth.

I invite you to research on the legal suits against Samsung for false advertisement of several of the issues above mentioned.  Hope this helps your decision on which TV to get but stay away from 3-D and especially from Sammy products.

However, it does have a couple of drawbacks.  Battery life is not the strongest. I did an hour-long workout streaming music from my iPhone, and the unit had degraded signal quality on a telephone call immediately afterwards, ultimately dying mid-call.  I've found myself now charging the unit immediately before-and AFTER-a workout.

A good point:  the headset does not move during my workout.  I've lifted weights, I've walked the treadmill, and I've used it during daily activities.  So far, I'm impressed there.  I had a Sony over-the-head headset previously that made me nervous to walk around, much less exercise.

Sound quality is good.  I'm no audiophile, but I enjoy what I hear coming from the speakers.

However, I find the ear cups don't rest quite correctly on my ears.  Thus, I must turn the volume all the way up on music in order even hear the music playing.  I wear a 7 5/8 hat, so I do have a large head.  The headphones fit well around my head, but just don't rest well over my ears.

Sound quality on phone calls is quite good, with most people not even knowing that I'm on a headset.  I still battle with hearing people on my end, particularly in a noisy environment.  Also, when outdoors, it does tend to pick up background noises quite a bit.  However, it does it's job quite well overall.

I was surprised to find out (later) that this company also makes the HDMI switch that I had purchased previously.  Considering how much I love the HDMI switch, I am hoping that I come to love this headset as well.

9386,254262,254262,B005LKB0IU,,4.0,"Pre-disclosure: I'm a bit of an audiophile. The sound quality on these are not the best ever. With a good device (with an EQ) you can get some decent sound out of them.
That said, these are great headphones for the price. I wear mine to the gym where there is loud music playing already, so I don't notice any lack of quality in the headphones there. Many people will look for in-ear headphones, possibly for size or comfort. I appreciate these in an additional way because my hearing ISN'T cut off from the rest of the world (contrary to what a lot of people want, so take that as you will). In the gym, again - where I primarily use them, it's handy to hear if somebody is calling my name for a spot, or if there's a PA announcement or something. I can easily hear that while still wearing my headphones. They also fold up rather well, and come with a bag to carry them in. The range is pretty good. I can leave my music player on a bench and go get weights from the other side of the gym without experiencing any interruption.
Some of the downsides not yet mentioned is that the main button is used for too many functions. You have to hold it down for a few seconds to turn it on, but hold it for slightly too long and it puts the device in searchable mode. This can be frustrating. Also, the plastic that goes around your ears can get uncomfortable after a time. Having a softer material or more configurable shape would be beneficial.

4304,193739,193739,B00427TAIK,,5.0,"I suffered for a while with a standard mouse.  Arm pains, elbow pains, wrist pains. Took me a while to take the leap and spend so much on a new mouse.  Mice are supposed to be a dime a dozen - in fact I had a few high quality mice which still gave me pain. It got really bad.

So finally, I decided to buy the Evoluent Vertical Mouse. After much research on different ergonomic mice and trying a trackball (no way couldn't get used to it) and trying a few other options short of spending so much on a darn mouse - I realized it was either this or nothing - I took the leap and bought it.

Super glad I did.  For the first couple weeks I thought I made a mistake buying this mouse. It was somewhat awkward and at first didn't fully relieve the pain. But I stuck with it. Slowly, I started not to notice the mouse when using it (which is a good thing).  I also don't know exactly how long it took but I had no more pain. And I am now actually almost as accurate in movement as my standard mouse of 20 years.

While I think 20+ years of using a regular mouse is hard to break - it took about 1-2 months until I was totally comfortable with the Evoluent Mouse - But now I LOVE IT and cant go back. Whenever I switch to using a regular mouse (even those ones that claim to be ergonomic but really just have a curve to them) I notice right away the strain put on my arm.

The build quality is excellent, the color and style are attractive. I am picky and find I am very satisfied with this mouse. They did not cut corners on the build quality - very nice.

I HIGHLY recommend this mouse and would not hesitate to get it again if I need to.  But you must give it a fair chance to work and I think you will find yourself not even noticing it has cured your pain - which is the way it should be.  Now, to get myself a better keyboard.

UPDATE: After using this mouse for many months - I am happier than ever with my purchase. You must give it time to get out of old habits. You might notice other minor arm pains for a bit as you get used to it but it is totally worth it. I couldn't live without it and don't understand how other use regular mice.

Now I need to get one for work and I will be all set.

- Fast aperture (f2.8 or better)
- Low time to first photo and fast recycle time (even if not ""burst"" mode)
- Custom aperture and shutter controls
- 1080 video

Both the Sony RX100 and the LX7 meet those requirements, but the LX7 is $150 cheaper. I actually picked mine up for $369 and saved almost $200 off the price of the RX100.

I had the Panasonic LX5 a few years ago and really loved it, so I was already comfortable with the controls and menu. It's just a great little camera and I take it EVERYWHERE with me. Anywhere I don't lug my big Nikon DSLR, I have my LX7.

Couldn't be happier with the size, image quality, or performance so far. And it's really durable... I just throw it in my bag or pocket and go. So far, the aluminum body has resisted scratches and dings well.

9184,272583,272583,B006K5505E,,2.0,"I could not wait to get my hands on this camcorder. I thought it would be an improvement to the one that I have, (the Sony HDR-CX150) but was I wrong. I am going to give the most thorough and honest review that I can give. When I read all the details on this camcorder, it gave the impression that it was far superior to the one that I had, and by advertising it as a ""newer model"" than mine.
I did a side by side comparison and shot the same video at the same time with the new Sony HDR-CX260V and the older model Sony HDR-CX150 and here is what I came up with. Keep in mind, that the older model records in 1080i, has an older low lux function for low light shooting, does not have a wind filter, has 25x zoom, and does not have a wide angle lens. With all that said, let me break the Sony HDR-CX260V down for you:

Records in 1080/60p - pros: A nice clear picture. Cons: Takes up a lot of memory fast, and to be honest, I thought the picture looked a little muted compared to the older model.

Low Lux (for low light shooting) - pros: Images do come out better in low light, like for indoor shooting. Cons: over exposes. My nephew's face came out so white and there was a bright glare on his face. Also it tends to be a little grainy around the edges. There is also a constant clicking sound when the low lux is turned on.

Wind filter - pros: You can still hear you, and other people when speaking on a windy day. Cons: even though you can hear voices more clearly, it seems to lose the stereo sound when the filter kicks in. Almost sounds like the voices are coming from inside of a wind tunnel.

30x optical zoom and 55x extended zoom - pros: The 30x zoom works like a charm, it gets very close to the action without losing any clarity. Cons: The 55x zoom takes a while to focus and seems to lose the HD quality.

Image stabilization - pros: The image stays nice and steady, even when running. No shakiness what-so-ever. Cons: none

Wide angle lens - pros: It does capture more of what you're filming, I'd say probably 3-4 feet more on each side. Cons: if you move to fast, it stretches the video on the sides and it comes out distorted.

So in closing, when comparing the older model with the newer model side by side, the older model outperformed the newer one in almost every way. The main reason for buying an HD camcorder is for the video quality and I saw a HUGE difference in the way the older model's quality (1080i) was compared to the newer one (1080p).The older one is much sharper and richer then the 260v. This camcorder also feels very cheap and flimsy, almost hollow. It is not worth $550.00. The only thing I liked better about the new model is it has a nice big 3 inch touch screen, a built in GPS that works nicely, and a built in USB cord, but the USB cord seems to only work when it wants to.  So remember, ""Newer"" doesn't always mean better.

Everything was going quite well until the last step when I had to  attach the projector bracket to the ceiling bracket but only one of the three screw holes would line up. Furthermore one hole was not keyed for a screw at all. I ended up using two screws instead of three after using a drill to open up the hole a bit on the outside mount to get it to line up  the ceiling base. The mount looks sturdy enough for a toddler to swing from so I will not bother processing a return.
I would draw special attention to step 3C in the instruction manual where one bolt needs to be screwed to the top cover on the projector. This bolt is the lock to the twist/release mechanism in its absence the projector can fall by accident as reported by a reviewer.  My projector is mounted behind a 14 inch beam so I was concerned with getting the image high enough on the wall pass the beam but the mount provides enough flexibilily to lock it at various angles.
Update: Locking the picture inside the screen frame was a bit challenging. It required an extra set of hands to hold the projector as shaking from locking kept knocking the picture off alignment. There is a screw you can fiddle with to make it less sensitive but it requires some patience. I recommend against angling your projector for a pure HT setup which can result in keystone correction and white light overspraying outside of your frame.

1458,164997,164997,B002P3KMNU,,5.0,"I was very careful in my search for an ultra-portable and finally decided on this ASUS. The other candidate was the Toshiba T235-S1350 with the longer battery life of the UL30-A2 being the deal breaker.

The GOOD:

Because this laptop does not have an optical drive it is extremely light and was much lighter than anticipated. And at less than an inch thick its profile lends to extreme portability.

While 12 hours is a bit of an exaggeration in battery life, I have been consistently able to get 10+ hours from a single charge.

One item that I was somewhat concerned about (from reading consumer reviews) was the Draft-N Wi-Fi. Prior to receiving the laptop I purchased a router that is N-dedicated. With the TrendNet TEW652BRP N-Router I have yet to drop a signal and consistently have the strongest signal possible. To test the range I tried this in my car from a couple of houses down and was able to ""surf"" the internet with absolutely no problem. I've used the computer in airport terminals and found no drop-off in performance. Contrary to some reviews, I am more than pleased with Wi-Fi performance and suggest spending a mere $39 in an N- dedicated router for the home.

The back-lit LED is amazing and makes an incredible display. The keyboard is very roomy for a laptop and very responsive. The only thing that has taken some getting used to is size of the right Shift key. It's not quite half the size of a normal Shift key, but small enough that it takes some getting used to..
The UL30A-A2 comes with ALTEC Lansing SRS speakers and the sound quality is absolutely the best I have heard from a laptop under 17 inches. With 4GB of RAM I am able to run PhotoShop and Office concurrently without a hiccup.

The NOT SO GOOD:

My unit came with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit pre-installed. Many of my favorite programs (eg., jZip) that I like to use are not compatible with a 64-bit system. In previous versions (builds) of the 64-bit system it was possible to run 32-bit as well. In later builds some processes can be made to run 32-bit, but not all, so I am unable to run some of my favorite programs and am awaiting the authors to make them 64-bit compatible.

I am not a big fan of touch pads and made this purchase knowing  that I would be using a USB mouse. However, on those occasions when I do use the touch pad, I have found the Button somewhat challenging. It is very thin and literally blends into the chassis. It is also a single bar that employs a rocker. Although this may be a non-issue with many, I find the button difficult to use.

In terms of aesthetics I don't think another ultra-portable can match this ASUS. Its brushed aluminum finish is attractive as well as functional by making fingerprints a non-issue.

In summary, other than my version of Windows being 64-bit and the touch pad button a challenge this laptop has exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend this to anyone, especially the discriminating traveler.",careful search ultra portable finally decided asus candidate toshiba longer battery life ul deal breaker good laptop optical drive extremely light much lighter anticipated le inch thick profile lends extreme portability hour bit exaggeration battery life consistently able get hour single charge one item somewhat concerned reading consumer review draft n wi fi prior receiving laptop purchased router n dedicated trendnet tew brp n router yet drop signal consistently strongest signal possible test range tried car couple house able surf internet absolutely problem used computer airport terminal found drop performance contrary review pleased wi fi performance suggest spending mere n dedicated router home back lit led amazing make incredible display keyboard roomy laptop responsive thing taken getting used size right shift key quite half size normal shift key small enough take getting used ul come altec lansing sr speaker sound quality absolutely best heard laptop inch gb ram able run photoshop office concurrently without hiccup good unit came window home premium bit pre installed many favorite program eg jzip like use compatible bit system previous version build bit system possible run bit well later build process made run bit unable run favorite program awaiting author make bit compatible big fan touch pad made purchase knowing would using usb mouse however occasion use touch pad found button somewhat challenging thin literally blend chassis also single bar employ rocker although may non issue many find button difficult use term aesthetic think another ultra portable match asus brushed aluminum finish attractive well functional making fingerprint non issue summary version window bit touch pad button challenge laptop exceeded expectation would highly recommend anyone especially discriminating traveler,"10 5, 2010",A1CIY24GFXEVSM,Mark,,Exellent laptop,1286236800,True,,1

I've installed various other screens on my other PDA's.  This product is unlike some of the other screen protectors as it requires the spray that comes with the product.

I bought the MRX-V70 to eliminate the need for multiple amplifiers and provide clean sound, and after one month, I am very happy with the result. I installed this in a 1995 Chevy Tahoe (2 Door), matted to an Alpine 7875 head unit, and am running Alpine Type-X 6.5 components in the front, Type-R 5.25's in the rear, and 1 Type-R 12"" Sub. The V70 could not have been a more perfect match for these speakers. The amp I received was rated at 99x4, and 373w x1 which nails the RMS of my speakers. Now, I am not one for the blow your ear drums setup (though this setup so far can go louder than I can stand without distortion), I simply wanted complete range and tone that's loud enough to drown out my engine and exhaust mods when I want it to. This does the job, again, perfectly.

As for the installation, the amp itself is very small, so I had many options of where to install it. I ended up installing it under my front driver's seat using the pre-cut carpet holes for the power seat with with wires sharing the power seat control wire covers, and because of this, it is impossible to know that there is anything installed other than the head unit. Additionally, because this is a single class D amp, I found that the power draw is incredibly low compared (actually, to even a single amp I ran before from Fosgate let alone) the setup I had before.

Oh, I know... buyers might not understand what this is.  I read one review where someone complained they could only access via their network!  No kidding, the name of the product is NAS.  Network accessible Storage!  Others complain the speed is slow when accessing their files from the Internet.  No kidding people... maybe the internet connection you were using was SLOW.  If your have an older 100mb network ITS YOUR NETWORK THATS SLOW!  100mb network = about 10MB/second at best.  If your copying files from your wireless device MAYBE YOUR WIRELESS IS SLOW.

This is my second one I purchased as the first one is now almost full.  Disk space is disk space..... but the software that comes with this device makes it perfect for me as BOTH a backup device and a file server.

Here is a tip for anyone interested.....  I use it to back up my digital media collection of home movies, pictures, mp3's etc from multiple PC's.....if one of my PC's ever crashes, I have a copy of that data. The bonus is that I share out that backup copy and now the backup data is used as my media server for all my devices!  Such as my Smart TV, WDTV media player, MINIX Neo media player with XBMC,  Windows Media Center, my smart phone or whatever.

I'm in IT for 30 years and handled 1000's of different components and software... it's nice to open this up, plug it in get it 100% functional in 5 minutes without having to look at any documentation... the terminology used is perfectly in line with industry standards.  If it's confusing for you, then you shouldn't be buying this type of equipment.

Performs very well.... On my Gigabit network, the Read speeds are good ranging 70-90 Mbytes/second for large file copies to my PC's ( depending on the PC)  Write speeds not as fast... get about 30-40 Mbytes/second for large file copies. Obviously there are devices that would outperform this, but were talking $200 or less for this device.

For me the best features are...
- easy setup - great features - low  price
- fast Read speeds
- has a sleep mode so 100% quiet when in sleep mode

My pair does play, using the same Motorola android phone, with the noise reduction feature turned off... but midrange and treble is attenuated. This gives them a nice background music tonal balance. Turn the switch on, and they really come alive. When turned on, the midrange and treble come up to match the bass for a more accurate overall sound. These can have deep bass if it is present, and midrange is smooth. Treble is their sonic shortcoming - and that's a quality issue more than quantity... it is a little harsh when compared to better headphones.

These are truly active noise reduction headphones. Some users have indicated that the hiss heard is intended to mask noise, but the hiss is really the only true issue I have with them. The electronic circuitry IS noisy! Music overcomes this, but the amplifier / noise reduction is not quiet. On the other hand, between the tight seal of the cushions and the active noise reduction, they do seal out constant background sound well. Their noise reduction seems to be especially strong in the lower frequencies. The result is what they are intended for, airplane and car passenger use.

I like the in-line volume control and separate microphone with control button. For my Motorola Moto G phone with Android KitKat 4.4, the switch does work. One click, pause, two clicks, return to start of song. With the phone, one click is microphone mute, hold for end call. Yet on my generic cheapie Apex branded Android tablet, also with Android KitKat 4.4, it does nothing. The tablet I have simply ignores the signal, and if I used a tablet more - I've buy a good one.

Overall it's a nice package. Hard travel case, 1/4"" adapter, airline adapter and the ""AAA"" battery is included.

For me this is a great way to add an additional HDMI port to a monitor I own that has a single HDMI and a single set of AV composite ports. I can also use this on an older TV that has HDMI and a dual set of AV composite ports. I did test this using a Blu-Ray player on the HDMI and to the TV and it worked beautifully as long as you do not set your video resolution to be higher than 1080p for Blu-Ray, but will support ancient 640x480 all the way up to 1920x1080. It also supports 480i or 480p up to the 1080p I mentioned above.  Of course, if you are using this to add HDMI to older display devices you are probably going to be limited in resolution anyway.

Then converter itself is small, hassle-free and does not require any external power.

The cradle plugs into an A/C outlet (must be a 3-prong outlet). However, above the the 3 prongs on this Belkin product there is also a screw and then another plastic prong above the screw. What does this mean?
1. You can only plug this thing in on the bottom of dual plug wallplate
2. The screw on the cradle replaces the screw on your wallplate so you must remove 1 and attach the other. This makes this cradle a hassle to attach and remove and it's not exactly small enough to blend into the decor
3. The plastic prong takes up the ground plug of the top outlet, limiting your ability to use that outlet

To me, the whole thing is just very poorly thought out and is going straight to my ""things I'll never use again"" drawer. On the plus side - if you can get past the design flaws:

- you get surge protection with all 3 outlets and all are 3-pronged outlets
- with the iPhone and iPad I tried, the charge was as fast as it is with genuine Apple chargers

5237,100459,100459,B000X27XDC,,4.0,"Typical workflow with a digital camera:
1) take picture
2) connect camera or memory card to computer
3) copy photos to computer
4) move photos from computer to sharing site, like Flickr or Facebook

New workflow with the Eye-Fi:
1) take picture

That's it. Eye-Fi automatically copies your picture to your computer and to your website.  The photos will be kept private until you make them public.

One downside to this is that your camera obviously must be powered on while the Eye-Fi handles steps 2-4 for you.  This may take 30-60 seconds, which may remind you of the old Polaroid days while you waited the minute for the picture to develop.  It runs the batteries down a bit faster, too, since you change your ""auto-off"" settings to give Eye-Fi time to do its thing.

Remember, too, it only works with a Wi-Fi network which you can configure.  So, Eye-Fi is connected to my home network, and when I'm home and take a picture, it functions as described above. If I'm out and about, the upload won't occur until I'm home and power up the camera again.  You know how you can go to a hotel and get a password at the desk to connect to their network?  You'll have to go in the Eye-Fi configuration and add the hotel settings there -- it's not enough to have your computer find the network, as the Eye-Fi operates independently.  (If this is an issue for you, buy the other Eye-Fi that works anywhere).

You will love this, especially if you share pictures. It's one of the best gadgets I've purchased for the camera.",typical workflow digital camera take picture connect camera memory card computer copy photo computer move photo computer sharing site like flickr facebook new workflow eye fi take picture eye fi automatically copy picture computer website photo kept private make public one downside camera obviously must powered eye fi handle step may take second may remind old polaroid day waited minute picture develop run battery bit faster since change auto setting give eye fi time thing remember work wi fi network configure eye fi connected home network home take picture function described upload occur home power camera know go hotel get password desk connect network go eye fi configuration add hotel setting enough computer find network eye fi operates independently issue buy eye fi work anywhere love especially share picture one best gadget purchased camera,"11 4, 2008",A2PR46SD34TRFH,Chris,,Great product for anyone,1225756800,False,,1

For the curious, the case comes in two pieces: one piece screws to the tripod screw hole on the bottom of the camera and the second piece attaches to the bottom piece by 2-3 buttons. The buttons are very secure so you don't need to worry about it.

I think the red color makes this case very unique and is definitely for those who want to stand out. If not, get the black version. The leather, is of course, not real leather, but it feels just like it and protects the camera adequately. This won't protect the camera fully, for example, from rain or being dropped hard, so I'd suggest buying a camera bag or full-cover bag.

The case comes with a red strap to match. Only small lenses like the standard 18-55 lens, or smaller lenses, will work with this case.

The protector wasn't super thick, but it wasn't super flimsy either.  It was easily manipulated using the spray and was extremely easy to install.  You spray the adheasive part of the protector and then you can move it around on the screen until it fits to where you want it.  It didn't pick up any finger prints despite the fact that I touched it a few times.

Very easy install and it was a perfect fit.  The feel of the protector is very nice in comparison to the feel of the Kindle's natural screen texture.  It's a smooth feel and so far I haven't had any issues using the touch screen.  It honestly doesn't even look like there is a screen protector on it at all.  The install kit comes with a rubber applicator that helped get all of the bubbles out no problem.

This is one of the few installs I've ever had that there were no bubbles or nothing got caught on the screen thanks to the cloth provided with it.  This includes everything you'd need to install the product.  The only thing that I found lacking was that there are no install instructions included, but it does direct you to their website to read them.

Overall, this is a great product.  I'm actually going to buy more armor suit screen protectors for my other devices.  What I like most about this is that you don't have to be extremely good at applying screens to apply this.  Spraying the back allows you to move it around easily and peel it off if you mess up without ruining the screen.",intial attempt install go great wound getting little spec something stuck screen actually came spraying armor suit spray came screen protector gently rubbing finger protector super thick super flimsy either easily manipulated using spray extremely easy install spray adheasive part protector move around screen fit want pick finger print despite fact touched time easy install perfect fit feel protector nice comparison feel kindle natural screen texture smooth feel far issue using touch screen honestly even look like screen protector install kit come rubber applicator helped get bubble problem one installs ever bubble nothing got caught screen thanks cloth provided includes everything need install product thing found lacking install instruction included direct website read overall great product actually going buy armor suit screen protector device like extremely good applying screen apply spraying back allows move around easily peel mess without ruining screen,"10 13, 2016",A1D9HT4IEAEJND,Jessica Weissenburger,,"Quick, Easy Install -- Don't Have to be an Expert!",1476316800,True,3,1

9470,176939,176939,B003C1CCJG,,4.0,"The Marware iPad case finally arrived today after a one week backorder. The case holds my iPad snug and secure, no worries there, and the little tuck-in tab seems to be long enough to prevent it from slipping out. All of the iPad's controls and ports are easily accessible, and its screen is not blocked at all by the surrounding soft, suede-like material. The elastic band keeps the case closed nice and tight when not in use. The little prop up shelf thing works well for elevating the iPad's position just enough for easier typing and for desktop browsing but does not hold it upright for watching movies or slideshows, at least not that I can figure out. I don't know about the magnet in the prop shelf, it seems that it might cause GPS interference as others have said. If I wind up keeping the case I will take that magnet out because it just seems like a bad idea to have magnets so close to the complex electronics of the iPad. The case is not bulky or heavy, I was expecting it to be much heftier than it is. Even so, the padding is plenty enough to protect the iPad from normal wear.

The biggest problem that I have with this case is its smell. It has a very strong chemical-like odor that, to me, is repulsive. It does not smell like an expensive case. For someone who is not picky over smells, the case is an excellent choice. If you are sensitive to smell, you should probably pass on this one.

I would have easily given the Marware Eco-Vue five stars except for the chemical smell and the magnets. It is also a bit of a drawback not having a secure, upright stand, but not a huge deal. So, three stars instead of five. I am airing the case out right now outside, and if the smell persists after that I'll sadly return it and continue searching for a better case. If the odor goes away will revise rating to four stars, but so far no luck.

Update: July 2 2010...

After airing it out for hours outside, taking it for a ride in the car, then stashing it in a drawer with real pretty smelling clothes, (all without the iPad of course) the chemical odor on this case seems to be a little less obnoxious. Went to Best Buy today and looked at another (In) case, but the quality didn't seem as good as the Marware. The exterior and interior padding seemed thin, there was no stand at all, didn't look to hold the iPad as securely, and overall just felt like a cheaper case but was 15.00 higher. Since the chemical smell on the Marware case seems as if it might eventually go away, I'm going to keep it. Am revising my rating to four stars, still subtracting one star for the magnets. They shouldn't be there and it's a shame to have to cut an expensive case to remove them.

Another update: Dec. 24, 2010...

The Marware case is holding up very well! After six months of heavy daily use, taking it with me almost everywhere I go, I still like the design and function of this case a lot. It flips open like a book and works easily in any orientation. The elastic band is still tight and holds the case securely closed. Ports are all still easily accessible after heavy use of the case, just some minimal slippage due to minor material stretch that does not impair access. The little kick stand props the ipad nicely on your tummy for comfortable reading in bed, and you won't get conked in the face if you nod off. The narrow tab thing at the top end of the case, supposedly there to hold the ipad in place, is pretty lame though. It's gotten much looser after six months of use and is definitely not dependable, for security use the elastic band too.  As for my quibbles with this case when I first bought it: The magnet does not seem to cause any problem at all with location functions, so no worries there. And, the strong chemical odor has finally disappeared from the case. Took a pretty long time though. Leaving it at four stars cuz of the smell problem and the hokey little tab.  Because of that long-lingering awful smell, I'd sure shop around before buying this case again.

5943,426470,426470,B00GGVPKKC,,5.0,"Operates as advertised, but a few kinks.

1.  My intention was to use this on the TV in my basement so I wouldn't have to have it on my main TV, adding yet another box on my entertainment center.  The plan was to use it to record, and then carry the recording on the thumb drive to my Western Digital Media player to watch.  As it turns out, the DVR records in ""blocks"" of 511 megabytes, so recording the 24 series opener gave me 25 files.  Only the first file was named with a "".mts"" extension.  That one plays fine.  All the rest of the files are named "".mts1"" "".mts2"" "".mts3"" and so on.  So, to play each of the files on any source other than the DVR, I had to rename all the files to "".mts"".

2.  File naming.  The recorded files only show the station ID and time stamp.  It makes no sense to me that if there is an electronic program guide and the ability to rename files manually (both of which work great by the way), why the unit can't name the recording using the name of the show.

3.  Clunky remote.  I'm never lost because the on-screen prompts that show what you can do, but seriously, why would I press ""hold"" to go full screen?  how about a button that says ""full screen"" or something intuitive.  I bought this as a test for my Mother in Law, and she will eventually pick up on the visual cues, but it needs to be made more user friendly.

All in all, a good buy.  I'll probably be buying another one shortly.

Update 5-13:

I gave it another go with a faster USB hard drive, and this time, the entire program recorded in one file.  It would be nice to know why.  I can only speculate as to why.  I hope the manufacturer is reading this.  Anyway, MAKE SURE you have a fast flash drive.  My original USB drive gave hiccups every few seconds.  Now it works fine.

Update 1/21/16:

unit has been having issues for a while now.  About two months ago, the coax input quit working, so I had to eat up an HDMI port to support it.  It quit turning on with the remote, although turning off and all other functions were fine.  It has frozen up a couple of times in the last week or so, and finally just shut off with no sign of life.

I still recommend this device.  I bought it on May 3, 2014 for 59.99.  That is still less than one month of service with any cable provider and has provided me nearly two years of good service.  I just ordered another one to replace it, and now they're 32.99.

Since I have not purchased the rest of the components for my upcoming build, I don't really have the ability to test them at the moment.  I am sure they are fine, but the minor cosmetic flaw will continue to draw my attention, until I know that they are not damaged.

As other have mentioned in reviews that I have watched on Youtube, the feet on this thing are total garbage.  I know that buying this case, but it is now confirmed.

The only other thing that I think takes away from this case is that on mine, the left side panel doesn't line up perfectly on the side panel behind the motherboard.  This may be due to damage that happened to the case at some point.  The item that I purchased was labeled as ""Used, like new:  Item has no scratches or dents, but packaging will be damaged"", or words to that effect.  To me, this means someone bought it and didn't like it, so they returned it.  At some point a small dent made its way onto that side panel, possibly effecting the rest of the panel.  Given how long it takes for a return through the pre-paid postage that Amazon provides (I live overseas), I am not inclined to wait 2+ months to get my refund/replacement case.  I learned this lesson in the past, for an item that I sent back to them on January 2, 2017.  To this date, they still haven't received it!

All in all, this is a really good case.  I did my research ahead of time, so I knew what I was getting for my money.  My main reasons for buying this case were (1) the aesthetics which tie into my Darth Vader themed red/black build, (2) the six available fan mounting locations, and (3) the price.  This case was everything that I wanted, cheaper than more ""premium"" cases that missed the mark (for what I was looking for) in regards to the overall look of the case.  Some people have said that the metal is very thin and cheap feeling; it is pretty thin, but I am not lugging my PC around like a suitcase, so I am not really worried about damaging it.  Overall, I am happy with this case.

Update (3/12/2017):

Everything works great with this case.  The minor cosmetic issues I previously mentioned are no longer issues for me, and should be taken with a grain of salt since I did order a ""used"" case from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  In this build I went with:  I7-7700K, Gigabyte Z270X Gaming 5, 16Gb Corsair Vengenace DDR4 (3000mhz), Cryorig H7, NZXT Sentry Mix 2 Fan Controller, Cablemods 60cm RGB/W LEDs, Samsung 960 Evo 250Gb NVME SSD, WD Blue 1TB HD, Coolermaster SP 120 fans, Corsair AF 120 fans, and EVGA Supernova 1000 G2.  The only thing really left for this build is the Gigabyte Aorus GTX 1080 ti once it is released (Founder's Editions just came out).

There is plenty of room despite what others have said, unless you have sausage fingers.  The only area where space is really tight is around the Cryorig H7, specifically the fan connectors above the processor on the board, but I think that is more due to the cooler than anything.

My main GPS is actually my phone, Samsung S4.
So, I didn't want to spend too much money a backup GPS.  Bushnell BackTrack fits that requirement.
I lived in US, northeast coast, where I received the product and tested.
It did take 3-4 mins linking up with the satellites for the first time.  All subsequent links were pretty fast.
Same thing when I arrived at the UK airport, the first link took a while.  All subsequent links were quick.  My guess is that the GPS remembers where the satellites locations were and able to link quicker the next time around.

The usage of battery power (2x AAA) is small.  After one week of use, the battery is still full.  I even had 4 hours of continue use on one of the trips.

Compass is functional even without satellites signals.
The only thing to remember is to read the BackTrack flat, if read in an angle, it will not give an accurate direction.
Also, it will not connect in narrow valley.  After coming out of valley, its fine.

There was this one time I came back to my car, and the BackTrack GPS said I'm still 70 yards off...  Well, the problem is the ""Mark"".
When marking, make sure the distance is 0.  If distance is >15 yards after ""Mark"", and you didn't move, then you should do the marking again.
Personally, I wouldn't use this GPS for treasure hunt because it's always a few yards off, sometimes 20 yards.

The Logitech died after I had it for only 3 months. Apparently it couldn't hold a charge any more. Right out of the box the Kensington connected quickly with my iPad and I was typing away. The keyboard layout works out nicely for my fingers and the tactile touch is nice.
Here's a few observations I've found comparing it to the Logitech
1.) PROTECTS. I love having a protective case around my iPad. I've already dropped it once without damage. The Logitech does not protect the iPad
2.) Auto Sleep-Mode. The Kensington shuts off automatically after a few minutes of inactivity, saving battery life. The Logitech stayed on unless your powered it off
3.) STABILITY. The Kensington has a weird stability. It sits stable when on a flat surface, but when i try to use it in my favorite spot (the recliner), it's tough to make the prop angle stable. On your lap, the screen wants to lean forward or backward. The LogiTech was very stable because of the way it sat in the groove.
4.) COPY/PASTE The Kensington doesn't have a Copy/Cut/Paste function key (or I haven't found it yet). This was a very useful feature on the LogiTech keyboard.
Overall, I'm very pleased with my Kensington. I'd give it the edge over the Logitech mostly for the case and the price.",bought kensington keyboard week ago replace dying logitech keyboard see keyboard cover combo would work better logitech died month apparently hold charge right box kensington connected quickly ipad typing away keyboard layout work nicely finger tactile touch nice observation found comparing logitech protects love protective case around ipad already dropped without damage logitech protect ipad auto sleep mode kensington shuts automatically minute inactivity saving battery life logitech stayed unless powered stability kensington weird stability sits stable flat surface try use favorite spot recliner tough make prop angle stable lap screen want lean forward backward logitech stable way sat groove copy paste kensington copy cut paste function key found yet useful feature logitech keyboard overall pleased kensington give edge logitech mostly case price,"12 28, 2012",A28C5DK21N81XH,F.

It's a bit confusing to switch from mono to stereo, presets, that kind of stuff but you get the hang of it. Sound quality is good, not flawless it does cut out sometimes.

My two biggest problems with this transmitter, and reasons why I had to change my review. One, the transmitter goes from 88.1 to 107.x... I live in Wisconsin, we don't have a whole lot of stations compared to some places, so I can't imagine this thing would work as well for people in say, Chicago, or Milwaukee, or some place more urban than where I am.

Second, and a little more worrying, where the thing plugged into my ipod, the rubber coating came loose from the plug making some of the wires exposed. This I did not like, I tossed it the day I noticed it because the last thing I wanted was a potential fire hazard. And for anybody that thing I stretched the cord too far or something like that. No. Most of the time I had it in a little spot about a foot infront of the plug (think 04+ Pontiac Grand Prix, little spot infront of shifter, with it plugged in right behind shifter). So there's no way I was stretched the cord, bending the cord or anything like it shouldn't have been.

Some background info:  I have two cpus (mac mini and macbook pro), but use the macbook pro 95% of the time and 100% of time for my foto related work (it's just that good and convenient).  Nonetheless, it is useful to have a 2nd cpu and thus when my apple 21inch cinema display died, I knew I had to replace the monitor, but didn't really need a high end version.

2.  With the above being said, this Viewsonic was an excellent choice for me for the following reasons:  a)  You can't be the price;  a truly excellent value  b)  As others have said, it has a fair amount of plastics, but I don't necessarily view that as a negative;  it's well built, slim and light.  c)  The set up is a no brainer;  actually with the cables supplied, it's less clutter than my old apple cinema display.

3. In regards to quality, even though I purchased this monitor without any significant expectation in regards to quality, this monitor is really nice.  Out of the box however, the results may look... off.  However, with proper calibration (I have the xrite monitor calibrating device), the results are very good to excellent (as far as my nonscientific eyes can determine).

First problem is that the software is problematic, you can make a change to the router and not be able to access the settings to undo the changes. Which if you are troubleshooting the settings to get a printer to work, you can essentially brick the entire device. The warranty only covers you for either 30 or 60 days, so if you have trouble with a computer, phone, printer or anything else after that, you have to pay a third-party support company to basically click a button in order to restore your device to factory settings.

That doesn't sound like a good plan, but also it is only offered by yearly support, and the cost of the support is more than a newer, better model from a top competitor. I also have nothing against tech support being from another country, until I tried communication with netgear's choice of help. I actually like and enjoy the sound of an Indian accent, but it is clear that they don't actually speak English, just phonetic pronunciations of a script. I have never had so much difficulty communicating with another person, but their own managers are not much better, probably the cause for having people who are so bad at it.

Bottom line is that the company is not planning on being around in the future, they don't even offer mediocre support for their products and the support that they do offer is held for ransom when you do need it.",long time user netgear product never buy first problem software problematic make change router able access setting undo change troubleshooting setting get printer work essentially brick entire device warranty cover either day trouble computer phone printer anything else pay third party support company basically click button order restore device factory setting sound like good plan also offered yearly support cost support newer better model top competitor also nothing tech support another country tried communication netgear choice help actually like enjoy sound indian accent clear actually speak english phonetic pronunciation script never much difficulty communicating another person manager much better probably cause people bad bottom line company planning around future even offer mediocre support product support offer held ransom need,"05 6, 2016",A42IMC86ZT3JN,Thundarian,"{'Capacity:': ' N750 Dual Band Router -Premium Edition', 'Model:': ' Router Only'}","So disappointed in this, netgear is a new synonym for ""buy something else""",1462492800,True,4,0

6285,334077,334077,B00A9XL53E,,4.0,"Product arrived yesterday, so this is a first impression review.

First off, WHEW!  There is some serious chemical smell with this bag.  I would say if the Michelin Man were to fart 4 truck tires this would be the result.  Aired it out over night and drive in to work with the windows down to try to cut through the haze.  I know that in a few days it will begin to dissipate and get better.....Hmmm but then WWI mustard gas is still found in some of the trenches.

The shoulder strap is a little thin and light material, BUT used metal/chrome connectors, unlike some that may use plastic.  The connectors on the bag itself are also a metal/chrome material.

The bag itself seems to be quite nice.  Both zippers worked perfectly.  The outside ""compartment"" is like neoprene, and will stretch to accommodate smaller items that you may shove in there.  If you put the power brick there, like another reviewer noted, you will get an ""unsightly bulge"", nuff said on that one ;-)

In side there is a main compartment in the top along with two smaller half sized compartments.  The half sized are perfect fits for the superdrive, or external hard drives that are of that width/slim.  The rear is capable of fitting some files or reports, a few cables etc.  And again, just like another reviewer noted, none of the compartments have a way to secure them, i.e.. they are always open and may be prone to dumping stuff out.

The compartment for the macbook is spot on.  Has some small nibblets on the bottom to give the computer some cushioning.  The single strap that holds the macbook in is ""fixed"" so you have to slide it under that strap to secure it.  BUT its a nice snug fit.  I am using this bag in conjunction with the iPearl mCover.  Seems like a great matchup for now.

It may sound like I am very negative about this bag BUT am not.  for the price it is exactly what I was looking for. Compact, slim, and not overly loaded with pockets, zippers, and flaps.  Grab and go!  Gives my macbook a little extra bump protection and piece of mind......Now if I can just walk a little faster than the new stink it gives off ;-)",product arrived yesterday first impression review first whew serious chemical smell bag would say michelin man fart truck tire would result aired night drive work window try cut haze know day begin dissipate get better hmmm wwi mustard gas still found trench shoulder strap little thin light material used metal chrome connector unlike may use plastic connector bag also metal chrome material bag seems quite nice zipper worked perfectly outside compartment like neoprene stretch accommodate smaller item may shove put power brick like another reviewer noted get unsightly bulge nuff said one side main compartment top along two smaller half sized compartment half sized perfect fit superdrive external hard drive width slim rear capable fitting file report cable etc like another reviewer noted none compartment way secure e always open may prone dumping stuff compartment macbook spot small nibblets bottom give computer cushioning single strap hold macbook fixed slide strap secure nice snug fit using bag conjunction ipearl mcover seems like great matchup may sound like negative bag price exactly looking compact slim overly loaded pocket zipper flap grab go give macbook little extra bump protection piece mind walk little faster new stink give,"04 24, 2014",A100K8BPAW2Q7F,Robert J.

7736,19215,19215,B0000CEPC8,,4.0,"I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it).  I am giving it 4 stars for:

-simple set up
-great sound quality
-solid talk and standby time
-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options
-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)

I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:

-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.
-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking ""talk me off speaker phone"", and I have to explain to them that I can't.

Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.

One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a ""soft phone"" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.

One show stopper right off the bat was that the cable shipped with the unit was bad. I was getting no lights on the network connection at all. I tried my own cable and bingo, it worked.

Once the camera is set up, it seems to perform and work great. There are some IPHONE and IPAD apps that can be used to control the camera. The app made by EasyN didn't work at all for me. I found another app called Eye Net Camera for my Android that does work, and another free app for the IPAD that worked.

4/12/2013 - Now that I've used this for quite a while I'm even more impressed. It keeps humming along, no issues.

Some points: I couldn't for the life of me get it to work in our business, but I could get it to work at home. It turned out that the wireless router at the business was an older model and wouldn't let the camera connect. Once I replaced the router, bingo, it worked.

The motion alarm is a great feature. We set it so that at night, if someone enters our business, we record them. The video files are uploaded to our FTP website, so even if a thief finds and destroys the camera, they can't get the video unlike most expensive systems.

The software used to set the motion alarm is tedious. They make you click a little square box for each 30 minute timeframe, for each day, that you want to set the alarm. It takes hundreds of clicks to cover the entire night. It would have been easier if they let you SHIFT and drag a whole section of time, but they didn't. If you turn off the alarm , your settings are wiped out and you must do it all again.  That's frustrating.",like chinese product feel cheap get job done like everyone else baffled instruction solved quest knowledge going youtube com find video install set camera got going fine one show stopper right bat cable shipped unit bad getting light network connection tried cable bingo worked camera set seems perform work great iphone ipad apps used control camera app made easyn work found another app called eye net camera android work another free app ipad worked used quite even impressed keep humming along issue point life get work business could get work home turned wireless router business older model let camera connect replaced router bingo worked motion alarm great feature set night someone enters business record video file uploaded ftp website even thief find destroys camera get video unlike expensive system software used set motion alarm tedious make click little square box minute timeframe day want set alarm take hundred click cover entire night would easier let shift drag whole section time turn alarm setting wiped must frustrating,"05 26, 2012",A26Z15QFLWZJ5Z,Scott Ames,,"Works well, if you can figure it out, feels cheap",1337990400,True,,1

The boat should be moving approximately straight, and the chart speed should be matched to the boat speed.  Such conditions are not present every day in the Gulf but when they are, the imaging works and is far more informative than traditional sonar.  Included below are a video of my marina's channel, and an image from an 'artificial reef', an area with concrete rubble.  The recordings include the GPS coordinates, and allow creating waypoints while reviewing the scans at home.

I decided it was time to replace both cameras with a single camera that can offer me a lot of the best features of both of the previous cameras.

The 10x zoom on this camera is fantastic.  This is a longer zoom range than I had on my normal ""walk-around"" SLR lens on my Rebel.  It will definitely come in handy when walking around outdoors.  The 9mp sensor creates nice quality photos.  Yes, the noise level in higher ISO photos can be noticeable, but frankly that is kinda expected in most smaller cameras with smaller sensor sizes -- it's the nature of the beast.

So that's a minor drawback but for this price you really can't get much better. The audio volume is adequate and the quality is about the same as is available on the cassette itself. If you're looking for high fidelity then you wouldn't be in this market.

The DF-40 is all three of the things for which I asked. However, in hindsight I see now that I needed to add criteria such as ""well-made"" or ""quality"" to the list I was using to determine my purchase.

The stand itself is adequate and what I expected for the price but the plastic head feels quite flimsy and even when locked down still has a bit of wobble to it. Enough so that shooting without a cable release or IR remote may well cause an unintended motion blur which kind of defeats the reason for using a tripod. All of the knobs and levers feel equally frail and I am willing to bet that something breaks on this tripod within the first half dozen uses. When I first mounted my D-80 to it, I was a little hesitant to move my hands away because the weight seemed a bit much for the head.

It seemed like a good value as the next major price point is significantly higher, but now that I have received it and given it a thorough look, I would not have purchased the DF-40 had I been able to see and touch it first.

EDIT (Please Read) - I've now had the product for about four months now and it has held up far better than I anticipated. The fragile knobs I thought would break still feel fragile, but they haven't broken yet and I carried the tripod in a backpack for about two weeks and it held up fine.

As much as I enjoy bacon and eggs, these headphones were obviously cheap enough that I didn't want to waste any money on them (even though they were only 5 bucks), despite my appreciation of the novelty.  However, I later received them as a gift from my wife, so I put them away in my desk drawer for an emergency backup.

Two nights ago my good outdoor headphones stopped working, so yesterday I put these ones to use.  First off, putting them in my ears was initially uncomfortable.  They came with 3 sizes of eartips but they're so thin and flimsy I seriously doubt changing them would make any difference for anybody.  They're on so tight anyway, that I don't think I can pull them off without destroying them.

The sound quality is very poor.  It sounds like I've cupped my hands over my ears and the source is in another room, which is something I've never experienced with better headphones.  If you're sitting still you can still hear the sounds well enough, albeit a bit muffled, but if you're moving around and working while listening to an audiobook, you have to crank up the volume to an uncomfortable level to for the reader to not sound like indiscernible white noise.  The supposed noise isolation is so bad that I had to pause my audiobook while sharpening metal tools, which I never had to do with my good headphones.

Oh, and I just noticed on the packaging that Ankit has a website, so I took a quick look at it, and the main header for browsing the catalog is ""New S**t"" which is probably a good representation of the company's attitude towards quality.",got breakfast champion bacon egg appear longer available otherwise identical design headphone poop design good representation entire product line much enjoy bacon egg headphone obviously cheap enough want waste money even though buck despite appreciation novelty however later received gift wife put away desk drawer emergency backup two night ago good outdoor headphone stopped working yesterday put one use first putting ear initially uncomfortable came size eartips thin flimsy seriously doubt changing would make difference anybody tight anyway think pull without destroying sound quality poor sound like cupped hand ear source another room something never experienced better headphone sitting still still hear sound well enough albeit bit muffled moving around working listening audiobook crank volume uncomfortable level reader sound like indiscernible white noise supposed noise isolation bad pause audiobook sharpening metal tool never good headphone oh noticed packaging ankit website took quick look main header browsing catalog new probably good representation company attitude towards quality,"07 29, 2016",A1AETOJ2FGD30X,Wally Waffles,{'Color:': ' Emoji Poop'},Too cheap to use by choice,1469750400,False,,0

The benefit of the square plate is that the camera can be oriented in a North, South, East, West configuration on a tripod, etc. simply by releasing the lock, lifting the camera and remounting where you need it.

The time/date stamp function that it has (that can be turned off if wanted) is WONDERFUL! I wanted to get an in-depth look at the functionality of this camera before I got one, seeing as how on my budget, $199.00 is a LOT of money, and I wanted to be sure of what I was getting (I'm certain others can agree with me!) All I can say is, save up your money and get one! This camera is GREAT! (In fact, I think I'm going to get another one soon!) If you want to see the video I watched that helped me make up my mind to get this camera, look for a review for this camera on ""Youtube"" done by a person named ""Techmoan"". It convinced me, and not only is this camera small, and has a 2 1/2 to 3 hour battery life, it's also very light! When my ""Metroflash E360"" that I purchased here on Amazon.com 3 years ago, finally 'gave up the ghost', I got this camera to replace it, and didn't realize how much heavier the ""Metroflash"" had been (especially since I have it mounted on my bicycle helmet!) Also, I had thought my ""Metroflash"" had decent 'low-light' performance, the ""Drift Stealth 2"" even beat it in THAT respect! On a scale of 1-10, I'd give the video a 10, the audio a 9.3, (the only reason it loses .7 of a point, is because of a whistle from wind noise)  and the rain resistance a 10! (It can supposedly be submerged 2 meters [or 6.5 feet] without a waterproof case, but I haven't tried that, nor do I plan to!) I am planning on curing the wind whistle with a product sold here on Amazon.com, called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Micover-Stickover-Mini-Universal-Windscreen-for-DSLRs-Phones-Laptops-Small-Video-Cameras/dp/B006IWYH4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Micover Stickover-Mini Universal Windscreen for DSLRs, Phones, Laptops, Small Video Cameras</a>"" I'll see how it works. I just really enjoy the camera, and would not fail to recommend it to any/everyone!

(UPDATE 7-1-2015)
The ""Micover Stickover"" I mentioned in my review, is excellent for cutting out that pesky wind noise I was getting, (even though I only get up to 30mph, seeing as how I'm on a bicycle) and I would recommend it to anybody who wears this as a helmet-cam on a bicycle,(but can't speak for a motorcycle, or motocross racer).

They were quick to respond although I eventually figured out how to work with the product.  My issue happens when the unit completely discharged (which happens in around 4 hours of use).  If you purchase the unit I would suggest you charge it after an hour or so of use.

2 - Some have discussed a gap that is created by the unit when placed on the side of your head.  After several months of use as shown in the pictures, I began to have some jaw issues - have no idea if the problem was related to the swimp3, but once you're used to this thing you will not want to swim without it, so I moved it to the back of my head while I swim.  That's the nice thing about bone conduction - doesn't have to be anywhere near your aural canal.  I hear it just fine mounted to the middle of the back of my head.

1140,252221,252221,B005JXADTG,,4.0,"This Philips waterproof pocket camcorder works well as video camera underwater, at the beach, in snow, and in rain -- anything that the elements will throw at it -- but as a standalone, everyday camera, you can probably do better.

The camera feels great in the hand, especially with the rubberized strip around the outside to provide a solid grip, even with wet hands.  The dark cherry housing is distinctive without being flashy.  The non-removable battery charges through a USB cable with a camera-attachment end (not a standard connection but one that I have for another camera, so it's not proprietary), and it charges fairly quickly.  The controls are mostly intuitive and easy-to-use, although, due to the waterproof housing, the buttons are not sensitive and must be pressed firmly.  Philips has included a flash, something you don't often see in pocket camcorders, let alone waterproof ones.  This works great for low-light interior and underwater video, although its range isn't far and you'll find that people may be reluctant to look at the camera.  The camera offers a one-touch button to switch between video and still camera.

The camera shoots in full 1080p video and 8MP stills, but here is where the camera falters.  The resolution of images doesn't matter if the optics, focus, and firmware are not top-rate, and unfortunately, especially with still shots, the Philips doesn't always deliver high-quality images.  My iPhone takes better stills than this camera does, primarily because the Philips requires you to firmly press a button in the center of the camera, and it almost impossible to hold it still.  I got more blurry stills than good shots.  The HD video is comparable to other pocket HD camcorders.  The zoom is awful -- sluggish and without the same sharp video you get without it.  The sound is comparable to others such as the Flip, but you need to hold the camera at the bottom to avoid covering the microphone slots near the lens.

The camera uses micro SD cards, and one is NOT included in the package, a real pain.  I had to order&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AmazonBasics-8-GB-microSDHC-Class-10-Flash-Memory-Card-with-SD-Adapter/dp/B0058GH450/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AmazonBasics 8 GB microSDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card with SD Adapter</a>&nbsp;before I could film more than 10 seconds.  Because Flip cameras have internal memory and Kodak cameras include memory cards, I was quite shocked to discover that the camera was unusable without this additional purchase.  The meager internal memory is used for a feature that records a few seconds prior to your pushing the button; I guess it constantly writes over images when it is turned on.

Mac Users:  the software on the camera does not work with the Mac OS, although iPhoto imports the video with no problem.  Usually, the programs that comes with cameras like this aren't all that great, so I doubt I'm missing anything.

If you want an outdoor camera in all-weather conditions and to use underwater, the Philips is a good option.  You might also want to compare to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kodak-PlaySport-Zx3-HD-Waterproof-Pocket-Video-Camera/dp/B0030MITDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kodak PlaySport (Zx3) HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera</a>, another good but not perfect option.

Completely ignore the 8 MP aspect because you're unlikely to get quality still shots that approach even budget digital still cameras.

I contacted Tenba who were very nice and offered to replace it with their new Discovery Messenger, which they assured me was a better bag. Boy, were they wrong.

One of the things I thought would be great about this bag is that they included a rain cover. Unfortunately, rather than creating an out of the way zipper pocket for it, it simply sits loose wherever you can find a space. And it's bulky. Very poorly thought out.

I would give these minus 5 stars if I could!

I bought the Logitech to replace some smaller Logitech S-120 speakers that got a little messed up when lightning stuck our home.

2 of the 4 speakers are passive, which means they do not work, or a better term is they are FAKE. Why would Logitech think we want to pay for FAKE speakers?!

Why not do better and make 3 of the 4 speakers passive if they want to make money for nothing?!

There is even a picture on the box that depicts sound coming from all 4 speakers equally. No sound at all comes from the 2 bottom passive speakers!

These speakers have an OK only sound, but just as good as lots of speakers that are less than half the size. And I have owned speakers in the past that were less than half the size that were twice as loud and sounded much better. They look nice, big, but they would sound much better if all 4 speakers worked. Maybe they should  have made the effort to design a bass port if they only planned to have 2 of the speakers active/working, then maybe there wouldnt be a need for the ineffective tone controller.

And the tone control has very little discernable change on the sound.

Battery performance will vary depending on the batteries you use, but with 3800 MAH NiMH batteries, It lasted far longer than the 3800MAH LiON battery I bought with the radio ever did. BTW, that is why I bought this battery box. The Baofeng 3800 MAH LiON battery I bought was thoroughly depleted after just 6 months of use. I figured I could do better with NiMH batteries. I highly recommend getting this instead of the standard 3800 MAH battery.

There is good chance the battery pack can short out if the middle battery contact comes in contact with the radio contact. There is only a small air gap between them.

7196,532007,532007,B00PVD13KC,,5.0,"This camera has an amazingly clear picture and impressive features that function as described. Although I get things to review for Vine for Amazon, I rate the item as I think it deserves. This camera earned these five stars. I didn't even know how handy this would be until I  placed it in my son's room t ensure he was doing his homework, and not playing on the computer while I was cooking. Don't worry, I didn't leave it in there. That would be creepy. It also came in handy when my daughter was sick in bed. If she needed something, she just had to say so, and I'd hear her. It was also easy to check on her just by looking on my iPad.

What I like:
-Easy setup (see below). I downloaded the app, scanned the QR card and the app walked me through the steps. I used the WPS method (you just push a button on your router and then hold the WPS button on the camera for six seconds so they can find each other). My Galaxy Note found the router without a hitch.  As far as the camera goes, you just plug it in. You then create an account using the app and log in to see your camera view.
-Superb resolution. 720p and not grainy at all.
-Good color, not black and white like cheaper cameras.
-Excellent refresh rate. It's not choppy like a webcam. The movement was pretty smooth 95% of the time.
-180 degree lens. I couldn't believe how much of the room the 180 degree lens picks up. At first, I was disappointed that you couldn't pan and tilt, but then I realized you don't need to if it's set up in a corner of the room.
-Can use with apple products, android and windows. I tried it with my iPad 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
-Night vision (seriously rocks). You can see everything in the dark. Of course it's grayscaled.
-Recording capabilities. I didn't try that, but it's good to know you can use a micro SD card.
-Zooming. You can pinch your iPad or phone to zoom in. It pixelates some if you zoom really close, but overall the picture still stays reasonably clear. Very cool.
-Sound. The sound quality is very clear and a really unexpected feature.
-Small, light weight and portable.
-Motion sensor with push alerts. I didn't try that feature, but it can come in handy when you get a notification and no one is supposed to be at home. I'm sure my cats would trigger that all the time.
-Long cord. Long enough to reach from ceiling to floor and then some.
-Portable. You just plug it into a socket, place it on a shelf and you're good to go.
-Snap shot feature. You can take a picture with the app. It's not something I will probably use, but it's a neat feature. I guess if there is someone in your house that shouldn't be there and you're not recording, you can take snap shots for evidence.
-Expansion. You have the ability to buy more cameras, set them up in different locations, set all the cameras up on your account and toggle between camera views on the app. Nice.

What I don't like:
-Ipad 2 connection problems. At first, my iPad couldn't connect with the camera. I took several tries. Finally, it connected, but then lost the camera a few hours after. It wasn't even on my list of cameras on the app. That resolved in a strange way. I downloaded the app onto my Galaxy Note, it connected instantly and then magically the camera showed up on my iPad. Very strange. But it has disappeared again on my iPad. So it's all good.
-The two red lights staring at me at night in the dark like evil demon eyes. Creepy, but not a game changer.
-Not sure about the security. You have to log into your account to access the camera on your phone, iPad or computer, but is there a risk that others can accidentally access your feed? I'm not techy enough to know the ins and outs.
-It gets rather warm, so make sure not to cover it with anything to prevent a fire hazard.

Something to note, although it doesn't affect anything, there's about a 5-7 second real time lag. It's kind of amusing to watch yourself move five seconds in the past when you bring up the screen on you phone.

7267,513010,513010,B00NJ4ARW0,,5.0,"SO glad I found these.  I had been running with normal buds (the type that don't go in your ear canal) and was going crazy resetting them every 15 seconds ... definitely a serious distraction when you're doing hard cardio.  I got these at wally world for 19.99 and used them the same night I bought them.  INSTANT APPRECIATION.

The fidelity of the ear buds is good enough for me.  Listening to some re-mastered Led Zeppelin I definitely heard nuances to the music I've never heard before .. while running hard, about to die, sweating a gallon a minute pounding like a herd of elephants on a treadmill in a gym that pipes constant loud music.  Good enough for me.

The cover design really is the money here.  By using silicon, which has a natural tackiness to it compared to other ""rubber"" and by inserting into the canal their 'put it in and twist' technique REALLY DO keep them in... while running several miles and sweating like a pig, while doing situps, doing all sorts of weird yoga stretches, lifting ... you name it.  My set included two different sets of covers; I experimented with the larger ones but the smaller ones (that were installed as shipped) fit me like a glove.  You can remove and replace them very easily; when you replace them, make sure that you shift them slightly ""off 90 degrees""... left on between 3 and 4 oclock, right one between 8 and 9 oclock.

It takes about two time inserting and removing them to get used to the ""twist lock"" design - after that, they go in and out as quickly and easily as any other earbud. Just hold it upside and put the pointed end in your ear ... then twist down to normal position and they're locked in.

These allow ambient sound in - a plus for situational awareness for sure - but since they direct the music into the ear I found that even at moderate volumes I could hear my music over the gym's music (which is constant and pretty loud).  However, by dropping the volume slightly I could hear what's going on around me and was able to find the right mix of music vs ambient sound pretty easily.  At one point I found myself *directly under* a speaker - these are large speakers, probably 100 watts or more - and I had to turn up the volume some.  At home I was doing some stretches in a room directly connected to the kitchen while someone else was banging around pots and pans, slamming the fridge door - those made it through pretty clearly with the volume at about 50% ... at that point, to coexist with someone banging around pots and pans while Im trying to chill to some Ambient music and stretch I probably would have preferred noise isolating headphones.  But I'm honestly very happy with the mix of music to ambient that I get with these at the gym.

I think the single button is ingenious as well.  It hangs on the right hand cord before the two cords are joined up, so you can easily located it even if you have the rest of the cord wrapped up, routed through a jacket, etc.  At first I wasn't sure if I would like having a single button, but now I can't imagine ever needing more than one button.  This single button allows you to pause and resume music, move forward and back a track, answer and hang up calls, and EVEN activate voice commands on my Android phone (ie Ok Google).  I made a voice call with them while driving, and the other person said I was coming in loud and clear.  I just installed a new Bluetooth gadget for my car that also uses the single button approach - honestly it sounds confusing at first (like, where's the forward button ? where's  the volume button ? ) but it becomes very intuitive very quickly and is more minimal.

They also include magnets in them, so the two earbuds stick together. That's a great, thoughtful innovative feature.  It does help prevent them from tangling a bit, but I really like that I can clip them behind my head when I'm not listening to them.  Yep, they'll clip to a locker even.

The very first night I wore these to the gym they were SO comfortable, so easily forgotten that I had them in, so stable that I wore them through my entire lifting routine as well - other than the cord (which definitely gets in the way when you're lifting) the earbuds stay perfectly fit.  When stretching, if my phone ended up a little further away I could literally drag it over the floor closer to me just by dragging with my head- the buds still stayed in place.

The earbuds themselves are the type that sit outside the ear, like iPhone ear buds.  You can purchase the Yurbuds cover seperately to replace any that have worn (or to turn ""ordinary"" earbuds into Yurbuds) but they're pricey and may be able to just buy a whole new replacement headset.

They come with a little carrier bag which also has a carry loop in it, so I can clip them to my lock, although the carry loop is becoming frayed already.

Because I need long recovery periods I tend to only work out once or twice a week for several hours at a time. The Yurbuds stay firmly put and are very comfortable in my ears for hours at a time, no problem.

I would honestly have to say that these are the best earbuds/earphones I've owned.  Don't buy these to listen to fancy music. Earbuds aren't for critical listening -that's what good headphones or good monitors are for.  But if you want solid audio sound and - more importnatly - comfortable, well fitting earbuds that STAY IN PLACE than this is the one for you. I wasn't paid, didn't receive a free sample, not a gilded reviewer or anything and I don't go throwing out 5 stars all over the place ... I bought these with my own cash at a retail store and really do love them.

Full disclosure: Now that I'm already used to listening to music during my whole workout, I've purchased some bluetooth headphones as the cable can definitely become an annoyance when lifting, and sometimes I need to rest my phone away from my work area.  If those workout, these will Yurbuds be my turn-to for outdoor running, walking/hiking and around the house; anytime I want earbuds that stay put and the cable won't get in the way.  This isn't a downgrade on the Yurbuds, it's just that I do alot of different exercises and it's enough that just having a cable becomes a nuisance.",glad found running normal bud type go ear canal going crazy resetting every second definitely serious distraction hard cardio got wally world used night bought instant appreciation fidelity ear bud good enough listening mastered led zeppelin definitely heard nuance music never heard running hard die sweating gallon minute pounding like herd elephant treadmill gym pipe constant loud music good enough cover design really money using silicon natural tackiness compared rubber inserting canal put twist technique really keep running several mile sweating like pig situps sort weird yoga stretch lifting name set included two different set cover experimented larger one smaller one installed shipped fit like glove remove replace easily replace make sure shift slightly degree left oclock right one oclock take two time inserting removing get used twist lock design go quickly easily earbud hold upside put pointed end ear twist normal position locked allow ambient sound plus situational awareness sure since direct music ear found even moderate volume could hear music gym music constant pretty loud however dropping volume slightly could hear going around able find right mix music v ambient sound pretty easily one point found directly speaker large speaker probably watt turn volume home stretch room directly connected kitchen someone else banging around pot pan slamming fridge door made pretty clearly volume point coexist someone banging around pot pan im trying chill ambient music stretch probably would preferred noise isolating headphone honestly happy mix music ambient get gym think single button ingenious well hang right hand cord two cord joined easily located even rest cord wrapped routed jacket etc first sure would like single button imagine ever needing one button single button allows pause resume music move forward back track answer hang call even activate voice command android phone ie ok google made voice call driving person said coming loud clear installed new bluetooth gadget car also us single button approach honestly sound confusing first like forward button volume button becomes intuitive quickly minimal also include magnet two earbuds stick together great thoughtful innovative feature help prevent tangling bit really like clip behind head listening yep clip locker even first night wore gym comfortable easily forgotten stable wore entire lifting routine well cord definitely get way lifting earbuds stay perfectly fit stretching phone ended little away could literally drag floor closer dragging head bud still stayed place earbuds type sit outside ear like iphone ear bud purchase yurbuds cover seperately replace worn turn ordinary earbuds yurbuds pricey may able buy whole new replacement headset come little carrier bag also carry loop clip lock although carry loop becoming frayed already need long recovery period tend work twice week several hour time yurbuds stay firmly put comfortable ear hour time problem would honestly say best earbuds earphone owned buy listen fancy music earbuds critical listening good headphone good monitor want solid audio sound importnatly comfortable well fitting earbuds stay place one paid receive free sample gilded reviewer anything go throwing star place bought cash retail store really love full disclosure already used listening music whole workout purchased bluetooth headphone cable definitely become annoyance lifting sometimes need rest phone away work area workout yurbuds turn outdoor running walking hiking around house anytime want earbuds stay put cable get way downgrade yurbuds alot different exercise enough cable becomes nuisance,"01 1, 2015",A3F4OO6AEYUWNG,Mark Twain,{'Color:': ' Black'},"REALLY do stay put even when running, lifting, yoga, anything.",1420070400,False,6,1

Maybe Microsoft learned from that, because the Presenter Mouse 8000 connects to my ASUS G53J notebook immediately, just as fast as a USB mouse. That's using the notebook's built-in Bluetooth adapter; I'm not using the dongle that was included. I teach computer classes and use a laser pointer, so having a built-in laser in the mouse means I don't have to juggle two things. I also find it helpful in class to use one of the side buttons for the magnifier tool (part of Microsoft IntelliPoint software).

Having the on/off switch is great to conserve battery life. And the battery compartment hasn't fallen off. Yet.

My major complaint is that it doesn't quite feel right in my hand. It's smaller than a regular mouse and is made of smooth plastic, so it always feels like it's about to slip out of my hand.

2140,227415,227415,B00505F01E,,5.0,"After getting better speakers (Def Tech 8060ST system), I spent a considerable amount of time tinkering with my Denon 2112ci settings. I became disappointed with the Denon because it made the highs too shrill with its ""HIFI"" processing and felt underpowered. It seemed to encourage crisp clear sound and my hears found it unbalanced and unnatural. Strangely enough, I chose the Denon over other brands about a year ago because I felt it made my Pioneer speakers sound better.

I saw the 809 going for $410 on Amazon, so I jumped on it (paid $420 for the Denon 2112ci). Short story is the Onkyo is better hardware and sounds better. I am comparing apples to oranges though... the Onkyo 809 is in the same tier as the Denon 3112 (not the 2112), but the Onkyo same tier receivers are always cheaper than the Denons, where you can always get a higher tier Onkyo instead of a lower tier Denon. If you have cheaper speakers, you might be okay with a cheaper receiver (in fact, it might work better for you), but better speakers demand a better receiver.

The 809 is loaded with inputs, outputs, and features. It literally has everything you can think of. Preouts, second video output, saved settings per input, wide or height speakers, zone 2, and so on. The back of the receiver has over 3 times as many connections as the Denon (the Onkyo is a few inches higher and 2 times heavier).

The sound is very refined and high-end without the ""HIFI."" If you turn the volume up, you hardly get that pink audio noise, which was really loud on the Denon. Compared to the Denon, it has more refined sound - there are more details heard without jacking up the highs. The Onkyo has ""warmer"" sound than Denon, but is still dynamic, while the Denon has an ""overdrive"" sound.

The GUI is much better than the Denon's, but could still use some work. A nice feature is you are able to run the Auto Setup Calibration and then still change the EQ settings. Most receivers only allow manual or auto configuration. Audyssey XT works well. There is a newer release of the unit that has Audyssey XT32, but I felt that wasn't necessary for another $250.

Speakers play a more important part in sound and you need a receiver that goes well with them.

7068,551784,551784,B00SU0LULU,,5.0,"I've been using this mySight Wi-Fi camera from iLuv for about a month now - long enough to know that the camera works great and the app is solid and reliable.

I've set up a number of IP cameras and I can definitely say that this one is the easiest and most straightforward of any I have ever used. It's a camera I would absolutely recommend for tech-phobic people as well as tech geeks.

Before buying, understand that you will need a smart phone or tablet - android or iOS - and wireless internet access wherever you want to place the camera. You can monitor your camera from a computer after setup but you MUST have a smart phone or tablet for set up because it requires a free, downloadable app for initial setup.

It comes beautifully and securely boxed. The camera itself is just really attractive. It almost looks like a small piece of sculpture. It's pretty enough that it looks great just sitting on an end table in my living room but it comes with hardware to mount it on a wall if that works better for your home. The camera can be manually tilted back and forth to allow you to aim it perfectly at your door or window. It comes with a nice, ribbon style power cord that's 10 ft long so you have some flexibility in where you place the camera.

The setup guide is simple and well written and easy to follow. Basically, you download and install the free iVideon app, set up an account, and then hold your phone in front of the camera. The app generates a QR code and when the camera sees it, it automatically connects it to your account. Then the app prompts you to enter your wifi network name (SSID) and password, which it sends to the camera. After a short period of time, the camera connects to your wireless network and you're all set.

If you have trouble with the camera failing to connect, move it closer your router or or orient it differently and try again. It make take a few tries but once it connects to your wifi, you can move it to a different location with no problem.

Be sure to remove the clear film that is covering the camera lens when unboxing to get the clearest picture.

From the app on your phone or tablet, you can monitor your camera in real time and you can also set it up for alerts - sound and motion. I have mine set up at a second home that is unoccupied most of the time. It's near a window and I get a sound alert when someone is mowing the lawn or when it's raining hard or when my neighbor's dogs come and bark at the door to see if I'm there. It sends a short clip, complete with audio, to my phone. It works flawlessly.

You can easily turn off notifications from the app for times when there will be lots of activity and you'd be getting constant alerts.

The camera is a wide angle lens so it covers a really large area. The resolution is HD 720p and is very clear. The night vision is just fabulous. My neighbor has the key and goes in to check things from time to time and I can clearly see his face. If someone broke in, the video is definitely good enough for police to use.

It even features 2-way communication! You can talk remotely to someone in the room remotely. I would have loved to have this when my mother was alive and I think this would be fantastic for anyone with older relatives that live on their own. Way better than one of those Life-Alerts for a lot of situations. Plus, you can add several mySight cameras and monitor them all from your app.

If you want to have continuous back-ups, iLuv offers cloud-based storage for a very reasonable $20/mo but it isn't necessary to get the alerts and video clips.

This camera does not have a remote tilt and pan feature and it isn't full, 1080p resolution but the app is great, the camera is very good, the night vision is excellent and the setup couldn't be simpler. If you need a security camera that doesn't require wiring and you can easily monitor from your phone or tablet, this is a great one to consider.

The wired Ethernet port on this laptop is a joke - instead of just a normal tried and true RJ45 port, some first year design student at Lenovo decided to ""improve it"" by removing the STANDARD Ethernet port and adding some collapsing draw-bridge type monstrosity that twice now has required me cutting the patch cable out of the port in order not to break the laptop.

See the attached picture to see what I mean.  The bottom part opens down to allow the RJ45 Plug to enter and latch, where it will remain for all eternity until you either break the flip down door completely off, or use a pair of electricians pliers to crush the RJ45 plug allowing the pieces to fall out.  This is the worse design on a laptop I've seen in years.

It was run from switching equipment through a hole in the floor, across a plenum, and back up through a hole in the floor to a computer. After hooking it up, video was working fine with no noticeable loss, however I wasn't getting any audio across the cable. Thinking maybe there was an issue at the switching equipment or the computer, I troubleshooted the cable by plugging it directly into an audio source at one end and a known-working set of amplified speaker at another. No dice.

Unfortunately, I was in a bit of a pinch for time, so I didn't have time to send it back for exchange. Luckily I did have the ability to send audio over CAT-5 for the job, which I did to rectify the issue. But the issue remains that video works, audio does not.

I can only assume that there is some sort of defect in the cable (maybe a bad soldier on two of the RCA heads (because neither left or right audio worked)? Or worse yet, a break in the cable somewhere. Just thought it was odd.

9834,77860,77860,B000WY8JRU,,5.0,"The TSX-300 radio is simply one of the best short range 2-way radios available.  It uses the 900Mhz ISM band (902-928Mhz range).  And is full 1-watt.  Uses spread spectrum technology (similar to CDMA Cell Phones:  Sprint, Verizon Wireless, US Cellular, Cricket) which makes it JAM-PROOF and highly unlikely that anyone can monitor while using the best scanner radios.  900Mhz band means easy penetration thru thick walls and buildings with dense materials concreate and metal.  It is simply the best for Indoor-to-Outdoor or vice-versa comms.  And has identical coverage with VHF when used for Outdoor-to-outdoor use.

The TSX-300 has a few additional features over the TSX-100 radio:

- 10 billion virtual channels (10-digit talkgroup numbers ; same as a USA telephone number.  Ex:  314-444-5555, but would be programmed as:  3144445555)
- Talkgroup ID and Radio ID naming.
Example Talkgroup:  7373737373 = HAMRADIO
Example  Radio ID:  3142311212 = TODD RADIO 1
- 100 Talkgroup ID memories
- Display of Caller ID of each radio using a NAME
- Direct Call to individual radio (Private chat)
- Text Messaging (Similar to Cell Phone SMS)

With the PRO, there is one notable CON:

- Do NOT place the TSX-300 or TSX-100 too close to each other.
- They sometimes experience De-Sync issue when a unit nearby
  transmits too close.  So keep them 4 or more feet apart from
  each other.  This only occurs when too close to other Trisquare
  radios.  This does not seem to occur when other nearby radios
  or cell phones are placed too close.  So no need to worry about
  MURS, FRS, GMRS or HAM radios are under 3 feet away.

At least 95-100% of all of the bad reviews or complaints about this radio is over this single flaw in the radio.  Rule of thumb, keep the
TSX-300s and TSX-100s a minimum of 4 feet apart from each other at all times, and you will never have any problems at all.

I am currently running it using a 1440p monitor, and it provides stable frame rates.  I can get a stable 60 fps with V-sync on in the meager games I play (SWTOR, WOW), and it can go over 100fps without V-sync, but commonly it will be around 70-80 fps.  I've seen it bottom out around 40fps in really intense PVP (SWTOR is terribly optimized, so it really isn't a great test).  I am going to try out Dying Light later this week, so I will provide a bit more info with a modern game on how it performs.  I don't play any first person shooter or the really demanding games, but if you are like me you probably have already seen the reviews all the different cards.

I know that having 8GB of memory isn't necessary for today's games, but hey, I don't mind it being there for sure.  Some really high intensive games will use that much memory for multi-monitor/4k, but for the most part 4GB will do.  This was fifty dollars more than the 4GB, and I wanted MSI, so I went for it.

Temps run around 55-65C when gaming.  I could imagine Crossfire would be a lot higher temp wise, but as a single card solution I think it is very reasonable temperature wise.  I have a full size tower with good air flow, so that does help.

Price vs performance this is a great card.  The GTX 980 (which I tried) is faster, but my eyes didn't notice the performance dip using the 290X, so I saved the $130 and went with this card instead.  As a single card/single monitor/1080p/1440p solution it is great.  If you want the best, then you probably are looking to Crossfire/SLI or a multi-gpu card, which of course is much more expensive.

Update:

So, I finally installed Dying Light the other day, and I am getting pretty consistent 60fps, with some drops here and there.  I was shocked at the smoothness of the game - I haven't really played any modern computer games up to this point, so it was really cool to see.

Temps were at around 70-72C, which is not surprising according to the reviews, and in general high-end graphics cards.  This is higher than I originally reported, but then again I wasn't playing the most modern of games.

I'm directionally challenged and always wanted one but the complaints of friends with GPS and the huge price tag made me wait it out. With all the upgraded features and prices dropping so much, I could not resist buying one. I've only been testing it in my neighborhood and to work but it's been accurate; 1 error in a street name but the SD map was from 2008. I called company, asked for the ""free"" latest map within their 30 day of purchase window.  Unfortunately, it's still 2009 since the 2010 won't be release until much later in the year; cost $10 for S/H to mail the SD map. Delivery was fast but now I need full charge before I can install the new software to use the new map. Since I only have the car charger and my drive to work is ~15 minutes, the battery still not max yet. I'll update after the upgrade and new map but the GPS is intuitive to use/program. I have no trouble figuring out the features, enter addresses and started using it out of the box.  Low volume is a major complaint of most GPS but with the radio on I still can hear this one clearly on max setting. Love the street names, turns announcements; no need to even look at the screen. It also have a bell alert immediately before each turn. The bright blue screen was easy to see in bright daylight too. One person complained it was too bright for night; the reviewer may not know about the brightness setting. Tried it myself, not a problem. I did not tried the free 3 month traffic subscription yet. My Miami commute is nothing compare to other major cities I've been in.

I was hesitant about this model with all the low reviews I saw here but since most were from 2008 and early 2009 and for the price ~$90 plus some very positive reviews, I was willing to risk it.  I think the company may have resolved the issues with upgrades, 30 days free map upgrade and better customer service. Like I said, I'll post my experience after the upgrade and new map to see if the company actually did fix the issues reported by some.  The customer service I got was excellent.

I'm happy with the price and features of this unit so far. I'm purcahsing a wall charger for this unit for $5. I already have a USB data link for the upgrade. If you live in a city where there were no major changes to the freeway, highways or roads the last few years then you can save money and not upgrade the map or simply wait for a later model with more current maps. GPS seem to be getting cheaper by the month.

UPDATE 04-Jul-10:
Got my wall charger last week and downloaded the software update so I can use the new 2009 SD map. The SD map came so quickly after I faxed Magellan the receipt with date of purchase, I had to wait for my wall charger because you'll need a fully charge unit first.  No problems with the download (took only a few minutes) but I had a problem after I inserted the new SD map.  It was my fault because I did not remove the plastic screen protector and it cause an error that took me more than 20 mins to figure out why it wasn't responding to touch or reset. Once I removed the screen protector, it reset and responded well to touch and so far no problems with the unit so I believe they fixed the software problem that others complained about.  The name error of the one street was still not corrected with the new map so save your money if you live in an area with no major changes to your roads in the last few years. Like other posters asked, do they really update those maps?!!

For the price and features, absolutely happy with the unit. None of my friends ever complained about the durability of a GPS so I think this unit will only be replaced in the future with a ""better"" unit or if the new maps at the current $80 are more expensive than buying a new unit.",first gps friend th directionally challenged always wanted one complaint friend gps huge price tag made wait upgraded feature price dropping much could resist buying one testing neighborhood work accurate error street name sd map called company asked free latest map within day purchase window unfortunately still since release much later year cost h mail sd map delivery fast need full charge install new software use new map since car charger drive work minute battery still max yet update upgrade new map gps intuitive use program trouble figuring feature enter address started using box low volume major complaint gps radio still hear one clearly max setting love street name turn announcement need even look screen also bell alert immediately turn bright blue screen easy see bright daylight one person complained bright night reviewer may know brightness setting tried problem tried free month traffic subscription yet miami commute nothing compare major city hesitant model low review saw since early price plus positive review willing risk think company may resolved issue upgrade day free map upgrade better customer service like said post experience upgrade new map see company actually fix issue reported customer service got excellent happy price feature unit far purcahsing wall charger unit already usb data link upgrade live city major change freeway highway road last year save money upgrade map simply wait later model current map gps seem getting cheaper month update jul got wall charger last week downloaded software update use new sd map sd map came quickly faxed magellan receipt date purchase wait wall charger need fully charge unit first problem download took minute problem inserted new sd map fault remove plastic screen protector cause error took min figure responding touch reset removed screen protector reset responded well touch far problem unit believe fixed software problem others complained name error one street still corrected new map save money live area major change road last year like poster asked really update map price feature absolutely happy unit none friend ever complained durability gps think unit replaced future better unit new map current expensive buying new unit,"06 26, 2010",A2IEX6RTEHI5DC,thia,{'Product Packaging:': ' Standard Packaging'},"Updated w/ new maps (had it for a week, no regrets so far)",1277510400,False,,1

It has a good Aux plug in, right in the front.  And the SD/USB inputs are a great bonus.  I picked up a 4GB card and filled it with old favorites.  It even recognizes folders, so you can put whole albums in their own folders and play each one separately.

The only real downside I've seen with this is the power input.  If you hook it up to a switched power line, you lose the clock every time you turn off the car (oddly, not the position on the SD card, though).  Or, if you plug it into a full time power line, you have to turn the radio off each time or risk draining the battery.  I went for the switched line.

The cards and USB have to be formatted in FAT32 (they don't list that anywhere), but most digital cameras can format them properly for you.

I don't drive a big rig, so it's hard for me to comment on those features. I drive an RV though, so I can definitely speak to the usefulness for RVers.

The best feature in my opinion is the bridge/overpass monitoring. I can enter the height of highest part of my trailer (the air conditioning unit) and this GPS will help me avoid routes without enough clearance for my rig.

I also like the mileage logging, because my trailer doesn't have an odometer, so there's no simple way for me to track mileage for maintenance purposes. I have a smaller GPS that I use for daily driving, and then this GPS tracks my trailer usage.

This GPS is big and rugged. The bezel is rubberized, but not really enough to make it impact resistant. Don't drop this, because it will definitely break.

3476,90031,90031,B0015ADDYY,,4.0,"I bought 3 different pair of headphones about a year ago specifically to use when I run. This pair of Panasonic is my favorite for 3 reasons:

1) Good fit to my ears and they don't fall or dislodge when I run. They do ride out slightly after the first few steps but then stabilize pretty well, so I just turn up the volume a little bit and I can hear music fine. I had to experiment with different headphones to find one that fit my ears and was stable, so this set may or may not work for you (but they are cheap enough to buy and try it out!).

2) Good sound quality. The Philips headphones had the best sound, but they kept falling out my ear holes when I ran so I couldn't hear the music anyway. These headphones are decent but maybe not the best out there, but considering the price it is a good deal.

3) Sweat doesn't seem to affect it. I had a pair of Sony earphones that would get muddled when I started to sweat and sometimes just completely shut off the sound. I have not had a single experience with these headphones yet like that after 1 year of heavy use (about 4 times/week).

After  a year of regular use, the headphones themselves are in great shape and I could keep using them.....if not for a failing connector. The wire at the base of the connector is starting to go I guess since music is starting to cut in and out when the connector is moved.

I guess the manufacturer took this into consideration since mine came with three screws not just the two that are needed.

I really like the fact that the SSD card is held in place by retaining clips rather than screws.  It makes it easy to upgrade should I decide I need more storage (once the price for SSD cards come down a little more).  I also like the compact size, it takes up very little space in the laptop bag.  One drawback though, the USB cable could be a little longer.  At just under 12 its great if you're only going to connect it to a laptop.  But if you have a need to transfer files to another computer like a desktop or tower model its just not long enough.

All the laudatory remarks in the other reviews are true --- except you might need to put a six year expiration date on them.

BOTH satellite speakers --- in splendid synchronized obsolescence.  The subwoofer appears to be o.k.  I would salvage the subwoofer except that the system requires the satellite be plugged in with the electrostatic volume control.

Now, the question is, did JBL choose a material that is bound to disintegrate in 6 years, or was there just a bad batch of foam that got mixed into the production?

I was really excited to see that it was a small package. I bought my mother a different headset last year and when it arrived it was huge. This headset is small enough - when it coils itself up - to fit into your pocket. It's really bendy and wraps into a pretzel when unworn. You could also wear it around the back of your neck. The coil is tight enough to stay on your head even when jogging. I like that it stays put when I push the treadmill up to 7 or 8. I always hated that when I wore wired earbuds, I could hear and feel the wire bouncing along as I ran. Sometimes the earbud would pop out after a while. I also like that after you get the earpads positioned comfortably, there's real bass. Not a little pitter patter, but a real boom. The forward and backward buttons are on the right ear (top and bottom buttons resepectively), the louder and quieter buttons are on the left ear (again top and bottom buttons respectively. The range for wearing the headset away from your mp3/bluetooth device is pretty good. At work, I leave my iPhone 4s on my desk and can go around the corner a good ways before I hear the beep. I wish I could remember the distance on the manual. They've lasted pretty durably and I'm glad for that as yet another headset I bought cracked at the wire after a year and now pinch the back of my neck. The one and only complaint I have is that the package only comes with 2 earpad sets. I lost 2 earpads, one of each size. It's been a real pain looking for a replacement set.

8884,225262,225262,B004YIFOZ0,,4.0,"* Easy to follow instructions:
Not sure what the other 1 star reviewer was talking about, something about cheap instruction stickers that are directly on the protective screen(film), ruining the protective film when she tried to remove it. Just like another reviewer had stated, each film has a clear mask on each side when it is new, and yes, they look like cheap instruction stickers on the mask, but they are on the mask and NOT on the actual protective film. On the masks, one side says ""Step 1, clean tablet before applying film"", on that same side of the mask, another sticker says ""peel off this mask before applying the film"". Once you are done applying the film properly onto the screen, the mask on the other side of the film says ""peel off this mask AFTER film is positioned correctly"". Anyway, the instructions were very easy to follow.

* Thickness
It is 0.13 mm thick, feels thick, should help with accidental scratching.

* Problem
I did run into a problem, when trying to put on the first film. I cleaned the screen as instructed, I only applied about 2 inches of the film, using the smoothing card to remove the bubbles, then noticed a single bubble that would not go away, right below the camera, looked like there was a tiny speck of dirt under the film, causing the bubble, I pulled the film off and checked the film and screen, there was nothing visible, so I tried putting the film back on, same issue, got frustrated and crumbled the film and threw it out. Grabbed the second film, same exact problem, got frustrated and threw that out. So I decided to use the tablet without a screen protector. I did whip the screen by breathing on it and using your typical bath towel, without any scratches. So far, the tablet screen seems as durable as the screen on the iPod, which I never used a screen protector, and I whip the hell out of it with my shirt for over a year, without a single scratch. Oh well, wasted money on this, but it is not the product's fault, as far as I can tell. Since I've never had a screen protector on my iPod and I let my 4 yr old son play with it, since he was about 2.5 yrs old, and there is not a single scratch, I bought these for the tablet, mainly out of paranoia, just because of the brand new item mentality, kind of like having a brand new car, where you will baby the hell out of it at first.

* Star Rating
I'm giving this a 4 star, because I cannot say that I'm 100% sure that the problem was with the brand new screen protectors or not, since I was unable to see that single speck of dirt that may had been on the screen.

UPDATE 4/24/2013

1457,86109,86109,B0013BVADG,,4.0,"I ordered these Boston Acoustic Horizon MM220 ($99)and Creative T40's ($125) 2.0 speakers of similar size and cost.

The reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the huge brick transformer that is required to power and use them as well as the lack of control for bass/treble.  They had a nice rich sound and the bass was good for what they are, however, they could use just a bit more.  For movies they were excellent though as good as the creatives for my testing.  That big brick transformer kept killing it.  The Bostons also have the great rubber feet that are very flexible and absorb allot of the shaking. As when I had them cranked they were in full shaking mode but no loss of quality sound nor did they move at all from where they were positions on the glass table top.

I liked the fact that the Creative T40's had the bass and treble controls and no big brick transformer unit to power them.  Each require separate power, however, the Creatives have a small footprint plug and no transformer like brick..

On the other hand the Creative speakers are about an 1 inch taller, wider and heavier. I felt they had a deeper sound from bass being it could be adjusted on a easy to reach front dial control.

One key thing to remember these are not 5.1 or 7.1 and you don't have a sub. This type of speaker is made for your computer desktop/laptop/ipod/gaming at a average level of good quality sound and volume.  I have a 7.1 channel system for my HD TV and stereo for when I need or want intensity.  I feel these small size speakers are really good for my purposes.  I will use them when I travel, even though they are heavy. I will have quality sound for music and blue-ray on the laptop where ever I am.

I liked the Bostons sound better when watching the movies, with some music I felt they just needed more bass when I tested, the Creatives sound great with either music or movies.  I would keep the Bostons if I needed another pair as they have a full rich sound but the brick and no control of bass/treble kind of helped me make my decision.  If you want lighter smaller speakers and the speakers are not going to travel you may want the Bostons as they are $25-$30 cheaper in cost and look nice and provide good sound.  I suggest finding a retailer to listen to them both or buy both and return the one you like least.  Sound is very personal to everyone and each have different ears and what they like when they hear music or movies.

I am only using these types of speakers for a Sony Vaio laptop. I tested each set with music and movies to determine my choice.

I will give a couple pros and cons first and at the end briefly describe my upgrades.  This is a desktop replacement for me so I can't compare it to other laptops.

PROS

Looks good.  Sounds OK.  Good screen - I have no problems with glossiness.  Keyboard is fine for me - layout takes some getting used to.  Flex isn't an issue for me, and as others have pointed out you can switch it out easily.  It was fast out of the box - a 55 second boot time.  See below to see how to get that down to 20 seconds.  Wireless seems stable and consistently fast to me.  Bloatware is manageable, and if you want you can have a fresh install of a legitimate copy of Windows - see below.  I like the touchpad, too, though I turned off zoom as it was too easy to activate rather than scrolling.

CONS

Sonic Master software makes the speakers sound worse IMO. Turn it off if your speakers are rumbling and buzzing with bass - it should be accessible from the system tray.  I've found the lid scratches easily - not sure if this is a common problem with laptops broadly - this is a desktop replacement for me.  I can say it's a little big and heavy, but you can read that here.  This is a laptop for real men, not sissy Mac types.  Just joking.

UPGRADES

You can use Crucial to find good prices and guaranteed compatibility with this laptop - just go to their site - buy matching pairs and just forget the 1 4 GB stick on there.  I have 8 GB of RAM now.  I purchased a 128 GB M4 Solid State Drive (SSD) from Crucial as well to replace the original.  The drive and ram are both easily accessible - search youtube for Asus N53 hard drive replacement - good videos.  After these installations I reinstalled a Windows 7 Home Premium I downloaded from the net.  During installation simply enter your Windows product key from the bottom of your laptop.  After a phone activation your operating system is fully legitimate.  You will need drivers from Asus at that point - you can get them online.  Search for Asus bloatware from google to see a list of utilities and drivers to see which are essential or useful.  After these upgrades and Windows reinstall the boot time is 20 seconds from powered off till I see my desktop.  The SSD allows blazing fast usability - highly recommended for old or new laptops.  Lastly, I purchased an Optical Bay Drive Caddy from newmodeus specific for the N53 series.  This allowed me to remove the DVD-ROM and install the original 500 GB hard drive in the optical bay.  This required popping off the keyboard (has latches at the top) and taking out one screw below the keyboard that secures the optical drive.  Was not super hard to do but you probably need experience with installing hard drives to feel comfortable with this.  Now I have a blazing fast 128 GB SSD for the operating system, programs, and large commonly used files and 500 GB for more general storage - all internal.  Sweet.

Out of the box this is comparable to the premium (i7 proc, 4 GB RAM) 15"" MacBook Pro.  For the price of the worst 13"" MacBook Pro you can upgrade it to blow all Macs out of the water - not to mention the other PCs.  I love making my Mac fanboy friends cry.

1596,312768,312768,B0090QXFP2,,5.0,"This is for EVERYONE before they start using the camera. UPDATE THE FIRMWARE!!!

The firmware is actually for the lens and not the camera itself. However, you have to update it through the camera with the lens attached to it. YOUR HYBRID FOCUS WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT THIS UPDATE!!. You also need to turn on phase detection AF to have hybrid AF. I've seen ""professional"" reviewers bashing the slow focus and bad night time AF when they're so professionally inclined to do a simple update job.

Hybrid AF = phase detection + contrast detection. Phase detection AF works great and as intended. It is faster than I can press a stopwatch. I do notice that phase detection does not work with illumination light or low aperture. Low aperture means a high fxx number! remember that! But even in my dark bedroom with only 1 lamp + shades, I am still at about F4.0-5.5 on the stock 1855 and therefore phase detection still works like magic.

I bumped ISO to 3200 and sometimes 6400 in my room to compensate for lack of light and pictures still came out with relatively low noise. I noticed my camera tends to underexpose a tiny bit so I bump EV +.3. However, this is only using the camera's LCD. I have not have time to upload the pics on my comp.

I did get the 10fps speed continuous. However, it really is only for the first 10 frames. Then it feels like 3 fps afterwards. This is with the Sandisk extreme class 10 UHS 1 45mb/sec. The Nex 5R does not support UHS so it reverts to class 10.

The flash attachment works great. When you install it, you must push it down and turn the little wheel on the inside of the bend. Else, it would pop out on you. I almost missed that step because I never read instructions.

HDR and DRO settings are in the color settings instead of camera settings. Why? I have no idea. Maybe the Japanese have a different way of organizing things. I tried it and it just works like in the product description. However, the last shot seems to take a much longer time than the first 2 shots. Remember that and don't pull the camera until it finishes. I think there are times where it needs up to 6 shots.

I don't know what people are saying about controls. Yes it is finicky initially trying to figure out everything since not everything is labeled. But it literally took me about an hour to get used to the control. Some of it is redundant and I hope they fix that. Like the top dial and back dials sometimes serves the same function which is annoying. It's not the easiest interface but it's definitely easy to use if you just invest some time and learn. Or like me, just play around pushing every button and turning every dial. You cannot break the camera by pushing buttons!

Image quality is excellent. I feel as if my lack of skills was compensated by the camera's ability to take great pics. It does most of the thinking for you. Rule of thumb is to use Intelligent auto for regular shooting and superior for high contrast scenes. Or pick a scene selection mode and it'll always get the job done for you. Once you google photography basics and learn about aperture, shutter speed, iso and exposure. You can use the priority modes or manual once you get used to the controls.

I spent 2 hours in my room playing with this cam, doing firmware updates, going out to a pho restaurant and snapping a few pics to try out the features. Everything is just like it says or better. AF is fast and generally focus on what you want but you can always use the touch screen to have it focus on something else(like if you want to focus something on the edge of the screen and defocus the middle and background). NO EVF IS NOT A DEAL BREAKER! first, you already know it has none before you bought it. And then the naysayers complain about wanting EVF + flash. WTH, the LCD screen works just fine at night. And if you are a pro photographer then I ask you why are you using this camera? haters will always hate. Dumb people will always make dumb decisions.

Battery life definitely last way past the 330 rated shots for me. I took about 180 and my battery was at 75%. Maybe they meant 330 on raw + jpeg with flash and LCD on brightest outside in -20 weather. But maybe they are compensating for the battery over time. IDK but the battery lasting longer is a good thing, no complaints here.

I do have a few complaints. I hate the wifi and touch screen. Touch screen is pressure sensitive and not touch sensitive. I feel like i'm bending the screen sometimes because I actually am! Wifi is useless. Stick the card in your laptop and enjoy the UHS speed. Plus it doesn't drain your cam's battery. Or better yet, just plus the cam into your laptop and you can charge/transfer photos at the same time. Windows 7 automatically installed the camera btw, I didn't have to install anything except Playmemory software if you want to use it. I don't want more junk, I didn't bother with it. I have playmemory on my ipad2 and it works great transferring there through wifi but it's much slower. You know what? screw you apple! when are you going to have an SD slot?!?!?!

Turn on lens distortion correction in your settings!!! These lens are cheaper but they are ok. With the distortion correction, these lens should be excellent but don't expect it to be like $4000 professional hardware because it is not! Sony charged you an extra $100 over body only. What did you expect? a few Ferrari F430?

I like the size compared to the performance. It is pocketable body only but who does that? With a 16mm pancake lens, you can pocket it but why would you? You will have a better social life if you strap it around your neck(not waist! it's 2012!). It's light enough to not snap your spinal cord and big enough for people to notice and start a conversation with me. I was sitting there eating pho tinkering with this thing and a lot of people was looking at it(no i wasn't taking photos) Some even came to ask me about it because they did not know which to decide. Some just came to admire it because it is a very cool looking gadget. I will repeat this one more time. DO NOT POCKET THIS CAMERA! and DO NOT TAKE OUT THE LENS UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO PROTECT THE SENSOR!. Yes, i took the lens off and it is right there in the bare.

I did some research on the web and found that memory stick duos will be slightly faster than sd class 10. It will also produce less heat from the camera. If you have money to eat steak and eggs in the morning instead of a coffee and rice like me then go for it. I don't like Sony all that much to give in to their expensive crap. It cost about twice as much as the equivalent SD card from Sandisk.

READ THIS!! I have solved the slow recharge problems. Instead of using the brick sony included, I used the usb wire sony included and plugged it in my ipad's charger brick. It recharged my 5r from 11% to full in less than 2 hours.

Pros: Fast AF if you update the firmware. Excellent image quality even at high ISO. A lot of features. Will improve your social life if you don't pocket it. Better manual controls. Wifi for Ipads. Battery life exceeds expectations. Flip screen. Free flash.
Cons: wifi lacks speed. No support for UHS-1. Touchscreen is smash screen. Not pocketable. Nothing protecting sensor with lens off. Controls are sometimes redundant.

8311,104064,104064,B0010LPBRK,,5.0,"My review on my largest memory purchase for my digital camera, the A-DATA 16GB Turbo SDHC Class 6 Memory Card.  With this 16 GB memory card, it is possible for me to take almost 9000 pictures at the best resolution for an eight megapixel Canon digital camera.  But my primary purpose of buying this large memory, is so I can record up to several hours of video on my digital camera. For that purpose, this fast memory card serves extremely well for that task. I had no problems using this memory on my digital camera so far.  The speed of this memory card is greater than the capability of my camera when it comes to recording as well is playing back the videos.  With this large memory, it is possible for me to use my digital camera like a camcorder on a trip providing the battery holds out.

When buying memory for your camera, be sure to do some research making sure you camera can handle the given memory size and type.  Me for instance, my camera is capable of handing a SDHC SD card up to 16 GB maximum.  Also if you want to use your card reader if you have one, be sure that can handle a card of this size as well. It appears, large memory cards of all varieties are getting cheaper and cheaper. I was able to use my USB card reader with this card connected to my computer to offload the videos. The specifications on my card reader did not indicated it was capable of reading a SDHC one. This apparently also hold true for my 7 inch digital picture frame as well. It apparently worked there as well. Also, with that device there was no indication on the specifications that it would work. If that didn't work, that would have been no problem for me.  I could just simply connected my camera to my computer's USB port instead. Using this card reader, I ran a speed tests on this memory.  The result was close to 19 MB per second in terms of read speed.  Using this memory card this way with my card reader, transform it to a 16 GB portable hard drive or like a jump drive if I wish.

I would like to add that with most devices this 16 GB SDHC card would more than likely work if your device is less than a year or 2 old. This will be true whether the device's specifications indicated so or not. The best options are: 1.  If possible to borrow one from a friend to try out on your device.  2.

8194,323383,323383,B009EIUH6G,,4.0,"Design: This thing is definitely aesthetically pleasing....it has a simple elegant shape that feels good in the hand and isn't overladen with extraneous buttons that I wouldn't use (number keys for example - I never enter channels directly using them and instead opt for selecting from a 'favorites' view on the channel guide.  I don't just want to see my favorite channels on the remote, I also want to see what's playing on them in the guide before I bounce between them).

I have a 650 that controls five devices in my bedroom and it's really an excellent remote, even if it is quite large and makes no attempt at hiding the fact that it's meant to replace a handful of proprietary remotes.  So why not opt for the same solution in the living room?  Because I have no fewer than 9 devices to control in that setting (the 650 supports a max of 5).  None are positioned off in a media cabinet or otherwise distantly located - so although I do have a couple of RF controlled devices, I don't require that feature.  I do want the remote to switch everything to my RF device inputs though, and let my RF remotes take it from there.

The design of a piece of technology matters to me.  After all, would I consider a TV for my living room if it performed awesomely but looked like a poorly conceived interpretation of a modern electronic appliance?  I would not.  This is not to say that form precedes function in my buying decisions, but it is most certainly a factor.  I no more want 8 oddly shaped remotes sitting out in plain view in my living room than I want one mammoth ugly universal one.  I like that this handily replaces all of those in my array and does it with some style.

Setup:  The whole process including collecting make and model numbers and installing a firmware update was roughly 40 minutes.  That's really not bad considering the 9 devices added and 6 activities configured.  The web based application is pretty intuitive and straight forward.  Full disclosure for whatever it's worth: I've spent part of my professional career designing web application software.  Google Chrome is my default browser and there were several instances where something disconnected and reconnected my remote.  It reconnected within seconds so although that's definitely buggy behavior, it didn't amount to much of a headache.  The sync kicked off and completed successfully each of the several times I executed it.  If anything, my background brings some empathy for having to keep up with a constantly evolving grab bag of available browser types and versions.  Not to mention Silverlight, which is sort of a confounding choice...the result is a simple and nice looking web interface...but not completely stable given all the complaints on this site.

There was only one device that wasn't recognized correctly without intervention on my part and even that was handled very nicely.  My amplifier is an older Bose system and when I added it, there was a warning that there are several versions and that the most common one would be used.  The amp failed to respond successfully after the first sync, so I reconnected the Harmony and the application guided me through a process where I pointed the original Bose remote at the 'learning' receiver of the Harmony Touch and repeatedly pressed the power button.  The software recognized the signal, selected a new Bose version and after the follow up sync, everything was working without a hitch.  I fined it quite impressive that Logitech's database so thoroughly captures the features of such a large cross section of remote controlled devices and maps the functions of each so well to the Touch.

Function:  I'll come back and update after I've spent more time with it, but initial impressions are quite good.  I'm controlling a lot here - a remote controlled HDMI switch is also in the mix and so the connections routed through that and then to the TV are enough to make most of my guest's head spin.  This remote brings order to the chaos.

There was an initial gripe that I think could have been preempted by a better design choice.  The home and favorites icons just above the touch screen don't blatantly hint that they are actually directly controlling functions instead of hinting at something on the screen.

But once your two years are up, watch out. At that point, my unit started either producing unwatchable recordings (where the video plays back in intermittent freeze-frames spaced 1-2 seconds apart) or flat-out didn't record at all -- and over time, the failures have come to outnumber the successes. Now, even the simple act of turning it on sometimes provokes a disturbing chorus of buzzing, choking, and whirring noises.

Junction View is shown prominently in Garmin advertisements for many GPSr's. It is deceptive advertising; it only works in a few, rare areas and Garmin won't tell you what those areas are.
Garmin on Junction View
<...>

Both searching the Garmin website and googling, it appears Garmin keeps Junction View locations a secret.  Calling and asking techs will get you varying answers as to how many areas it works in.

You can post Q&A on Garmin's and other forums and hope someone will confirm what areas work for you.  Once guy said it did work for parts of New York City....great.  I can confirm it does not work in Richmond, VA.

But then again I could be wrong about Richmond.  It appears Garmin's map updates can delete junction view.  JV has to be re-installed manually by downloading a file and mounting the GPS as a drive (i.e. the installer program uninstalls junction view, but doesn't install it back on).  Garmin does not provide this information on their Junction View page, you have to search the help files on the correct keywords you'll find that out.
<...>

The Amazon sales page should have a caveat in big letters highlighting that:
- Junction view, while given it's own prominent paragraph and picture in the advertisement, works only in a few small, select areas.
- Garmin keeps those areas a secret
- If it does work for you, updating your maps can delete junction view
Thus if junction view works in your area, you are lucky (and don't update your maps if you want to keep them)

If junction view does not work in your area, you need to:
- search the Garmin help files, find the write junction view file for your unit,
- follow directions to save them on your desktop.
- You will NOT use the map installer program to install the map files,
- Instead follow the directions to mount the GPS as a drive and manually insert files into correct location for your unit
- Note that the above just puts the files on your GPSr, junction view may not display in your area.

If junction view still doesn't work for you, it's either because
- you installed them wrong, or
- they don't work in your area
- the install process changed again
- you downloaded the wrong file

If it does pop up, just count yourself lucky and don't update your maps.",unit overall work well suitably reviewed purpose review warn junction view note different lane assist work junction view shown prominently garmin advertisement many gpsr deceptive advertising work rare area garmin tell area garmin junction view searching garmin website googling appears garmin keep junction view location secret calling asking tech get varying answer many area work post q garmin forum hope someone confirm area work guy said work part new york city great confirm work richmond va could wrong richmond appears garmin map update delete junction view jv installed manually downloading file mounting gps drive e installer program uninstalls junction view install back garmin provide information junction view page search help file correct keywords find amazon sale page caveat big letter highlighting junction view given prominent paragraph picture advertisement work small select area garmin keep area secret work updating map delete junction view thus junction view work area lucky update map want keep junction view work area need search garmin help file find write junction view file unit follow direction save desktop use map installer program install map file instead follow direction mount gps drive manually insert file correct location unit note put file gpsr junction view may display area junction view still work either installed wrong work area install process changed downloaded wrong file pop count lucky update map,"06 1, 2011",A2WL88J22CRY6O,Wayne,{'Product Packaging:': ' Standard Packaging'},"Unit good, Junction View does not work",1306886400,False,3,0

The installation could not have gone smoother, fired up and went right to work. The ""tweaking"" software leaves a little to be desired but does the job. I immediately started throwing Blu-ray movies at it and it performed flawlessly with even graphic intense 3D movies. When it is really pushed it shows it's weaknesses but I doubt 99.9% of home theater aficionados will even get to that point much less notice. When the gaming PC in the house lost it's power supply I didn't hesitate to allow our kids to play on the HTPC and it performed as I imagined it would which is: great on minecraft, poorly on newer FPS games such as battlefield.
After having this video card for 9 months it overheated while watching Avengers 3d blu ray and cooked itself. Now comes the strange part... nvidea ran me through a battery of test to troubleshoot the issue, they determined the card was bad. They then sent me links to contact EVGA Europe (living overseas) and instructed me how to warranty it. It took about 30 minutes for all that. Big thumbs up to Nvidea customer support. Then EVGA had a chance to drop the ball and in what could be the most shocking move by a computer video card manufacturer, they walked me through the RMA process and approved the whole warranty in about 24hours. That NEVER happens. I have been building PCs for 10 years and the service from Nvidea and EVGA was stellar.

8307,9168,9168,B00006B8DA,,4.0,"This is a very sturdy and ruggedly built KVM switch from Startech that for the most part delivers what it advertises. First, I do not have any monitors that go above 1080, so I have no way of testing higher resolutions. I am pretty sure that there is an upper limit to what resolution can be obtained from a simple VGA connection though. If you need higher resolution, you would be better off looking for a KVM switch that supports HDMI connections, not VGA.

I was a bit disappointed when I opened the box and found that there were not only no cables (not that they were promised) but no 5V power supply either. I often build and repair my own computers, so I had plenty of 5V adapters laying around. They aren't exactly difficult to find online for cheap, either. However, as it turns out, I have yet to run into a situation where I actually needed to plug-in a power supply. The switch works fine without it on the two Windows and one Linux workstation I have running on the device. Perhaps if you are using the included USB hub to power some external devices you may run into trouble, but for everyday use I have not needed to use a power supply yet. All of the buttons light up fine and the unit seems to work well without one.

Another slight annoyance was the polarity of the KVM cables needed to link between computers and the switch. I had an entire box full of older KVM cables that I thought I would be able to use. It turns out that they are incompatible with this model though. I was able to solve the problem by ordering a handful of VGA gender changer adapters. It would be nice if KVM manufacturers stuck to some sort of standardization though. The previous 3 KVM switches I owned all worked fine with the KVM cables that I already owned.

Setup is ""simple"" in that it is just swapping out a bunch of cables, but don't expect to get it done in 5 minutes. I spent about an hour running cables for my three cables and monitor. Fortunately, there were no real surprises once I got the appropriate cables/adapters though.

(1 Pack) iPad 2 / 3 / 4 Screen Protector, Etrech 9H Hardness 0.26mm HD Tempered Glass for iPad 2 / iPad 3 / iPad 4

The ipad screen protect is very easy to place over my ipad 3. Took me 3 tries to get it aligned to my liking. Even came with two home button sticker (aka pimples. One white, one black). I didn't use the pimple.

Came with all the stuff need to clean your ipad screen prior to putting on the screen protector. Cleaning cloth is too small in my opinion, so I used the one I got from the optometrist. Makes it a lot easier to clean.

Pros:
- Fits like a glove.
- Provide all materials needed to clean your ipad
- Easy to apply. no bubbles when I applied
- Does not scratch screen when keyed, or finger nailed.
- Can read pdf's out in the sun

Cons:
- The surface of the screen protector had some sticky-ish stuff on the surface. Can be wiped after installation, but don't know why it there in the first place

Tip: Start from the home button. Slowly lower screen protector from home button side. Check alignment for at until 30% coverage. If alignment is correct just let go and screen protector will fall into place. If alignment is not correct, pull back up slowly and align again. Rinse and repeat till you get it right.

Tip 2: Pealing off the initial sticky layer may create static electricity. Place a piece of metal by work area. Touch clean metal after pealing sticky layer may help to remove static electricity so your hand doesn't attract dust in the air.

Disclaimer:
I have received this product at a discounted price or free to provide an honest review.

Edit: July 30
Seems the sticky layer was probably a manufacture issue. Etrech replied quickly to emails about the issue and resolved them promptly. A+ to their customer service.

Lexus does not make the XM module for my vehicle any longer.  There are a couple of third party options (iSimple is one I tried).  For the cost and easy installation this thing is great.  They tell you to mount the antenna OUTSIDE the vehicle.  Yes, for the best reception that is what you should do.  I can tell you I have the antenna on top of the dash as far forward as it will go.  That works fine.  I have used a similar configuration when it was in the rear window.  Also worked just fine.  I also like the idea of being able to use this in another vehicle.  Not something I will do often but I have a plan for using it this summer in another vehicle.

UPDATE:  I was getting some engine noise through my AUX Input.  I found a filter here on Amazon that worked great!  It is made by PAC.

I plugged in my new Juicy headphones into my laptop and was incredibly disappointed with what I heard.  Quite frankly, I suspected that the 2.5mm to 3.5mm stereo adaptor I had used to connect the microphone was not, in fact, stereo but was mono.  The sound was simply awful.  It was tinny, flat-sounding,with much static.  I heard no discernable lows, let alone anything resembling bass (and the concert featured a lot of great bass guitarwork), nor were there any highs at all. I was all set to write a 1/5 review of the microphone, but I thought that just maybe I ought to verify the that the problem originated with the microphone, so I switched to my Sony MDR-E828LP headphones I spent around $10 on a few years ago.  Suddenly, I discovered that my microphone had, in fact, recorded in stereo, and was really quite decent.  The Sonys replayed much of the concert very similarly to how I remember hearing it a few hours before.  The problem was purely the Juicy headphones.  To be blunt, these Juicys sound about as bad as headphones can sound.  Their only redeeming features are that they sit comfortably in most ears and if you had the bad luck to have purchased this junk, at least you didn't waste much more than the cost of a hot dog-soda combo at a convenience store.",got back concert videoed dslr using brand new olympus external stereo microphone tried minute see worked plugged new juicy headphone laptop incredibly disappointed heard quite frankly suspected mm mm stereo adaptor used connect microphone fact stereo mono sound simply awful tinny flat sounding much static heard discernable low let alone anything resembling bass concert featured lot great bass guitarwork high set write review microphone thought maybe ought verify problem originated microphone switched sony mdr e lp headphone spent around year ago suddenly discovered microphone fact recorded stereo really quite decent sonys replayed much concert similarly remember hearing hour problem purely juicy headphone blunt juicys sound bad headphone sound redeeming feature sit comfortably ear bad luck purchased junk least waste much cost hot dog soda combo convenience store,"12 12, 2011",A3OY7Y5FUR4ZBY,Not my real name guy,,"Comfortable, but horrible sound",1323648000,False,16,0

High Def:
The 1080P simulated image from this projector is incredible. You can't tell the extra pixels aren't there. The actual image looks very film like. If you stand 1 foot from the screen you can see a screen door, but no one watched movies that close. I typically sit 7-10 feet back and the picture is perfect. Switching between a high def signal and a standard def signal takes this projector several seconds. This is annoying. Yes, you think you will only watch high def. Well many menus are not high def, so if you go to a cable box menu to choose something to watch you have to wait several seconds with no screen. Then after you choose something, you have to wait several more seconds to go back.

3D:
It is an absolute pain in the butt to turn on and off 3D. I use my FIOS On Demand to watch free HBO 3D movies. First you have to go to the very last configuration menu, then the last option for advanced, then the last option for 3d, then you have to choose the first option to turn it on. then the menus completely exit automatically (Other menu selections don't exit). However after turning on 3d you have to go back to that same exact menu to select side by side. This doesn't exit automatically so you now press the menu button several times to exit. To turn 3d off, you have to reverse the process.

However, 3D does work great. And you don't need a PC or a special box. All you need to do is get some DLP-Link compatible glasses. I got these because they have such great reviews:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate3DHeaven-Ultra-Clear-DLP-Link-compatible-3D-Glasses/dp/B004RBV2J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate3DHeaven Ultra-Clear DLP Link compatible 3D Glasses</a>. Thats it. 3d glasses, this projector and something which offers 3d, like FIOS or a 3d blu ray player. The 2D to 3D is ok, but its not real 3d. Some things pop out nicely but its not quite the same. I don't know if its worth the headache. But to turn on 2d-3d conversion, you just need to press 1 button on the remote. go figure.

Pros: Great image although the native resolution is lower than 720P. You probably won't be able to tell.
Low price on a projector that has the latest 3d technology in it and the only 2d-3d projector I can find.
Light weight if you are a travelling type.
3d built in. Many budget projectors require the purchase of a separate converter or a PC.
Turns off quickly. About 5 seconds.

Cons:
Menus and interface are poorly written
Slow to switch between resolutions like 480p, 720p, 1080p.

Setup was simple, and my network speeds surged (as my LAN speed was now 1 Gbps as opposed to 100 Mbps). Even browsing the internet via direct connection was slightly faster than with my previous G router (DI-624). I also purchased a D-link Wireless N MediaBridge to extend my wireless N connection to my basement media room. Works great with Xbox Live (sign ins are significantly faster and download speeds have tripled). Streaming HD content between the upstairs and downstairs computers works great now (stutter-free with NO dropped signals so far)... I couldn't even attempt this with my previous wireless G setup.

I'm very happy with my purchase and I would highly recommend both the DIR-655 and the wireless N MediaBridge (DAP-1555) for anyone who needs a fast home network.

1) Router is very unstable and drops the connection a lot. While you can watch netflix without a problem (since there is a buffer), you will constantly get kicked out of games (computer, xbox, etc). If you are working from home or doing a skype/hangout video call - it will constantly get disconnected. Router needs new firmware. Seriously flawed.

2) The smart wireless mode in which it decides which 5GHZ or 2.4GHZ connection to assign each computer is a plague. If you are between the 2.4Ghz and 5 Ghz location, it will constantly disconnect you and reassign you to the next one. Perhaps this is part of the top issue.

3) I will probably return this router to get the netgear nighthawk. Without a stable internet connection, all the features are useless. I'll wait until April to see if Asus get's a legitmate update. For everyone else, I advise you to buy another product until asus fixes the bugs (if its even possible).

The hardware and app were easy enough to connect and download respectively, and to get up and running w power and internet, but the base station was not able to be recognized. I followed the simple short steps and reset to factory default settings as directed many many times. I read through numerous community help comments and saw several people seemed to have had the same problem. I tried some of the fixes that were suggested (powering on, off, plugging in, out, resetting again and again). Just as I was about to give up and wait for morning to call customer service, it picked up my base station.  I am unclear what I did to make that happen, other than following the steps on the app and the forums over and over, so I can't really give any pointers. The few hours I spent trying to just set this up irritated me quite a bit.

When I got the cameras working (they paired very easily once the base station was picked up), I set them up in various parts of my home, and over the next several days tried the devices out. The color is very clear and the night vision very good, and the alerts seemed to be picking up a lot of the movement, especially when I tried them on two sides of the living room w high traffic- so much so that I turned the scheduling on only for times we were out, so I wouldn't get so many beeps on my phone or notification email in my inbox. When the weekend came, I had time to try to install these outside, and the limited wi-fi range (my wifi is fairly strong w a mesh system, but who knows) made it impossible to move the cameras even a few feet away from the walls of the house. One camera is outside our front door facing the courtyard's outer door, and I could not put the other camera outside at all, due to sporadic cut-outs and not working for hours at a time. So I placed it looking outside through a window towards the backyard, but the motion detector did not seem to pick up any movement  through the glass, and it didn't work at night due to the glass reflecting back at the camera. I re-positioned it inside looking at the inside of the backdoor.

Having used these for about a week now, it appears that the cameras only sporadically pick up movement, and you have to be fairly close- no more than about a few feet away.  Also, if you walk quickly through the camera zone, it may not pick up motion. This can be remedied by putting the cameras right next to the entrance you are interested in (it would take some stationary time to break in, but since the cameras are not recording unless the motion detector detects, this system is not reliable enough for security purposes I was desiring.

What the cameras seem best at doing, is monitoring real time inside or immediately outside your home, such as when you want to see your pet or baby sleeping or you hear a noise or something like that. Overall, though, I don't believe these cameras are consistent enough for security based on reliable motion detection. I noticed Arlo Pro provides longer distance motion detection, so this upgrade may be more useful.

Update: i added a star to this- 4 stars, ""I like this,"" because for the purposes of real time monitoring where you can check in and view, this system works very well.",set arlo camera system amount difficulty hardware app easy enough connect download respectively get running w power internet base station able recognized followed simple short step reset factory default setting directed many many time read numerous community help comment saw several people seemed problem tried fix suggested powering plugging resetting give wait morning call customer service picked base station unclear make happen following step app forum really give pointer hour spent trying set irritated quite bit got camera working paired easily base station picked set various part home next several day tried device color clear night vision good alert seemed picking lot movement especially tried two side living room w high traffic much turned scheduling time get many beep phone notification email inbox weekend came time try install outside limited wi fi range wifi fairly strong w mesh system know made impossible move camera even foot away wall house one camera outside front door facing courtyard outer door could put camera outside due sporadic cut out working hour time placed looking outside window towards backyard motion detector seem pick movement glass work night due glass reflecting back camera positioned inside looking inside backdoor used week appears camera sporadically pick movement fairly close foot away also walk quickly camera zone may pick motion remedied putting camera right next entrance interested would take stationary time break since camera recording unless motion detector detects system reliable enough security purpose desiring camera seem best monitoring real time inside immediately outside home want see pet baby sleeping hear noise something like overall though believe camera consistent enough security based reliable motion detection noticed arlo pro provides longer distance motion detection upgrade may useful update added star star like purpose real time monitoring check view system work well,"09 9, 2017",A23P5BO1UGNIRR,KC,{'Configuration:': ' 2 Camera Kit w/ Mount'},"Good For Real-time Monitoring, Somewhat Unreliable Motion Detection",1504915200,False,,1

I've tried two in the past, and they either didn't work right, or they took so much setup that I was never sure if I'd done it right, and once the instructions were misplaced I couldn't figure out how to add a device.

I thought this pair of universal remotes, on the other hand, did a good job.

Literally, within five minutes of opening the package I had a remote up and running.

The instructions are as follows:

  Turn on your tv (or other device).

  Select the specific device on the remote (i.e. the tv button, or some other appliance) and hold for 5 seconds until it blinks

  Type in the four digit code of your device (there are 25 common brands with their codes on the ""quick start"" instructions, and a much longer list in the user manual.)

  Press and hold the controller power button and let it go once your device (i.e. your tv) turns off

  Test.

That's it.  It really was that easy.  (And if you make a mistake, you can just exit and restart).

For the price that you pay for this remote, I thought the manufacturer provided just the right ease of use --I was pleasantly surprised.  The only problem I have, and it is not the device's fault, is that it takes a little time for me to figure out which device I want to control, and you have to select the device first, before you can control it.  You can't just turn the tv off, for example, you have to select the tv, and then turn it off.  (Perhaps I'd like the off button to ALWAYS turn off the tv, by default, then I could take my time shutting off the other devices.  Or perhaps there could be a ""master"" off switch, which I could code to turn off the devices I wanted at once...)

*SkipDr. has a machine for Wii games however, I have used this same machine for our Wii disc.

Bad review issues- Stopping and Slowing down-
**Stopping
There may not be enough mist applied. The spray mist provided provides lubrication between the wheel and disc.
Check the repair wheel, the blue fan looking part. After exhausting all other conceivable issues, I took the repair wheel after and re-installed it. It worked perfectly. If the wheel isn't secure in place or if it has defects such as being slightly warped, it will stop to prevent disc damage.
**Slowing
Again, check the amount of fluid applied.
Remove disc and put it back in. 9 out of 10 times the disc was pushed all the down. Wanting to be gentle with the disc, I was not applying enough pressure when pushing down.
Sometimes I would just nudge the disc slightly and it would start moving on it's own.

My SkipDr came with an adapter. Knowing now how well it works, I would have no problem purchasing a power cord. Look at watts/volts/amps, you may already have one you can borrow from another appliance.
I would not recommend batteries. No more than a person would use it, I see that as a waste of money.

But I was confused about magnets that were used to hold the table in place and complaints that they couldn't detach the tablet from the case. Well the magnets are used to hold the tablet in place on the base when you are typing. The magnetic force is very positive. This works better than any other approach I have found. Either you set the tablet on a smooth surface where it will scoot around on you or to hit a thin slot just right for the tablet to slide in. With the magnets, you just start in the basic direction and the magnetism does the rest, it guides you in and holds the tablet there like it was permanently attached.  A note on the weight, it still is under two pounds which makes it lighter than a chrome book (2.2-2.6 lbs) and it actually has storage and runs native applications.

3052,435417,435417,B00HA6R1IQ,,4.0,"Well, with a great amount of trepidation, I bought this computer on 11/15/14 after reading both how slow it was AND how fast it was (based on the various conflicting reviews on the internet). I did not buy it thru Amazon, but another source.

First, out of the box, it is SLOOOOOOWWWWW! Excrutiatingly slow. This is not simply due to the windows updates as some have proposed, but to TWO things: only 4gb RAM is installed (which is SHARED with the graphics processor), and a 1TB hard drive that runs at only 5400rpm and is a SATA 2.

There is SO LITTLE RAM left after the graphics processor uses what it needs to run the HD display (which is indeed beautiful), that any programs or updates have to continually swap in and out of the remaining RAM to run - this, coupled with the relatively slow hard drive, creates a bottleneck - and a frustrating one at that.

After figuring out how to get inside the computer (you have to remove the back cover carefully by prying open the lower right corner of the cover with a VERY thin blade, and slowly unsnap it around the entire circumference of the cover, AND once inside, you have to remove a metal shield that covers the RAM slots), I added an additional 4gb of ram ($40) to max it out to 8gb, and a Samsung 250gb Solid State Drive ($99.00).

After the upgrades, and NUMEROUS windows updates, it now runs as it should. While not a speed demon, it is perfectly fine now for everyday tasks such as web surfing, email, Netflix, etc.

If you are not comfortable opening up a cleverly sealed computer to upgrade it, I would not recommend buying this. However, for those who have no problem tinkering around, you can make this a great addition to your home. It's just too bad Samsung ships it ""hobbled"", because it is a beautifully designed computer that looks great on our kitchen computer desk!",well great amount trepidation bought computer reading slow fast based various conflicting review internet buy thru amazon another source first box sloooooowwwww excrutiatingly slow simply due window update proposed two thing gb ram installed shared graphic processor tb hard drive run rpm sata little ram left graphic processor us need run hd display indeed beautiful program update continually swap remaining ram run coupled relatively slow hard drive creates bottleneck frustrating one figuring get inside computer remove back cover carefully prying open lower right corner cover thin blade slowly unsnap around entire circumference cover inside remove metal shield cover ram slot added additional gb ram max gb samsung gb solid state drive upgrade numerous window update run speed demon perfectly fine everyday task web surfing email netflix etc comfortable opening cleverly sealed computer upgrade would recommend buying however problem tinkering around make great addition home bad samsung ship hobbled beautifully designed computer look great kitchen computer desk,"11 24, 2014",AV8C1RGR1BKJC,A.

It is very handy to have the built-in clock feature since the radio is only three feet from my wife's reading chair.  The radio also has a light button that when pushed lights up the station/time view area for a few seconds.  The view area always displays the radio station, but when the time button is pressed the time is displayed for a few seconds and then reverts back to the station frequency.

I was a little leary in purchasing another Lacie device, but their customer support is very good and I know their products are usually very good.

This newer model is substantially improved.  First, it no longer has a fan to cool it (which I think was unnecessary before anyway).  The inside only consists of a hard drive and a small circuit board.  It is completely sealed and just uses the outside aluminum case for cooler (which hardly gets warm).  This model also runs much quieter than the previous one.  The software that it runs (linux based) is much more improved as well.  The web interface is easier to use and you can also control more things, like turning off the blue light on the front and letting it go into sleep mode at specified times to save money.

Also, I am able to stream photos and listen to music from my DirecTV box with this.  The previous model had this same capability, but never worked right and would constantly hang.  This one works flawlessly and is easy to setup. I really like this, as you can show guests pictures right on your TV. It comes in handy.

I suppose that it would work from a USB 2 port as well, just that the four USB 3 ports would actually be USB 2 ports.

6149,720264,720264,B007U66T66,,5.0,"Puma social buds, keg buds earphones.

- I have accepted that earphones die an early death and I have stopped ranting and raving about their early demise. It seems that only luck and fate determines how long your earphones last.
- I am not a world renowned audiophile and I am just an enthusiastic casual listener of music. So what I may regard as 'decent' you may regard as 'rubbish'.
- I was skeptical about buying Puma earphones especially after buying Sketchers earphones which died after two weeks. I replaced them and the replacements didn't fare any better. I thought that shoe companies would all make crappy earphones. I was wrong. I purchased Puma El Diego earphones on sale and they were very good and then I stumbled across these here on Amazon and gambled. I'm glad I did. These keg buds are decent and for the price are worth It. I use mine primarily as 'commuter' earphones. I only use them to listen to music or watch movies on the phone while on a bus/train/subway and walking to and from the bus/train station  I have not put them through the rigorous sweaty workouts that strike a death knell on earphones. For workouts, I use the iHip active (just the grey ones, other colors like bright green die early and the NFL iHips have the worst sound ever!) or the Polk Audio 500 or 1000 (too much bass)

- they have decent sound. They don't have as much bass as the Polk Audio 500/1000 (too much bass I might add) but they send the sound very well to your ears.
- the pouch provided is very helpful as it protects the earphones from damages and external influences and I religiously put the earphones in so that I cannot misplace them. Very nice addition.
- they sound like they have too much 'treble' in the beginning but after a week burn-in period, the 'treble' softens and all sounds blend in.
- they stick to your ear well enough and do not slide out. What I did, as I was taught, was to use two different sizes of earbuds (3 sizes are provided) and then determine which size fits you better and then put the corresponding earbud on the other ear.
- they don't hurt after hours of usage, if you position them right. I had positioned them wrong the first couple of days and the outer hard plastic scratched on my ear and hurt me after a while. I slightly twisted the earphones and they felt right and the pain went away.
- they do have a mic option which is pretty cool as you can use them to talk on the phone. They do not have a feature for adjusting the volume like the Puma El Diego but I adjust the volume rarely and I do it on the actual phone, so it's not a big deal.
- I interchange them with the Puma El Diego earphones, which for me, rank amongst the best 2 'commuter' earphones I have used. The problem with the Puma El Diego is that they slide out so often that they are best used with a skullcap in the colder months where they are secured to the ears. As it gets warmer, they do slide out often, forcing me to keep sticking them back to the ear. If only they didn't slide out. If they fall within your budget range, get the El Diego as they have an almost perfect balance of bass and treble. Once again, I am not a world renowned audiophile.
- I bought a second pair so that I would be stocked up once the first pair bought suffers the inevitable audio mortality. Hopefully, they'll last a while.

In short, they are good average earphones for the average user and are worth buying at the price offered. If you are anal about your sounds, then these are not your ideal earphones. These are for casual listening. If you want to hear the exhilarating twang of B.B King's guitar just as it was in studio, then check elsewhere.",puma social bud keg bud earphone accepted earphone die early death stopped ranting raving early demise seems luck fate determines long earphone last world renowned audiophile enthusiastic casual listener music may regard decent may regard rubbish skeptical buying puma earphone especially buying sketcher earphone died two week replaced replacement fare better thought shoe company would make crappy earphone wrong purchased puma el diego earphone sale good stumbled across amazon gambled glad keg bud decent price worth use mine primarily commuter earphone use listen music watch movie phone bus train subway walking bus train station put rigorous sweaty workout strike death knell earphone workout use ihip active grey one color like bright green die early nfl ihips worst sound ever polk audio much bass decent sound much bass polk audio much bass might add send sound well ear pouch provided helpful protects earphone damage external influence religiously put earphone cannot misplace nice addition sound like much treble beginning week burn period treble softens sound blend stick ear well enough slide taught use two different size earbuds size provided determine size fit better put corresponding earbud ear hurt hour usage position right positioned wrong first couple day outer hard plastic scratched ear hurt slightly twisted earphone felt right pain went away mic option pretty cool use talk phone feature adjusting volume like puma el diego adjust volume rarely actual phone big deal interchange puma el diego earphone rank amongst best commuter earphone used problem puma el diego slide often best used skullcap colder month secured ear get warmer slide often forcing keep sticking back ear slide fall within budget range get el diego almost perfect balance bass treble world renowned audiophile bought second pair would stocked first pair bought suffers inevitable audio mortality hopefully last short good average earphone average user worth buying price offered anal sound ideal earphone casual listening want hear exhilarating twang b b king guitar studio check elsewhere,"04 2, 2015",A13YCEHOME8UYC,iluvgr8tdeals,,Perfect As Commuter Earphones...,1427932800,True,,1

It will run up to four batteries at a time, and you can set each one individually to charge or discharge at it's own rate...regardless of what the battery next to it is doing.

You do need to calculate the rates yourself. My main batteries are 2000mAh, so I drew a chart on the instructions that shows 1C = x, 2C = y, 3C = z...  So from now on I only need to look at the chart I made.  The instructions explain what ""1C"" means.  That will all make sense once you read the instructions.  They were very helpful, they could probably be improved but they were sufficient for me and I don't have any special experience with rechargeable batteries.

Basically all you need to know is that charging them too fast is bad, and charging them too slow is not very good either.  So you have to pick a medium rate for charging or discharging.  This ends up requiring a lot of time to charge your batteries, but it makes the batteries last significantly longer than using those cheap rapid 2 hour chargers (as in, they will be rechargeable for many more months).

5224,77857,77857,B000WY8JRU,,5.0,"USAGE:

I'm part of a group of about 30 people who all use these, typically all on the same channel. At times we're spread throughout the woods, usually in varying terrain (hills/mountains/thick woods/brush), and sometimes flat-lands.. areas as large as 120 acres. We've been using these radios for over a year now with scarcely an issue with being able to hear each-other loud and clear.

They are secure, reliable, and easy to use!

I'll keep my review short, because there's lots of folks who've exhaustingly posted up about these radios. I'd give these a 10 if I could, instead I can only give a 5/5!

PROS:

* Too many good things to mention!

* Outperforms standard FRS systems - Our group uses them in mixed terrain, flatlands to mountains to trenches, heavy woods.. 50..70..120 acres, no issue

* Secure, unlike standard FRS--even secure against the same model radio, thanks to encryption

* Private and Public channels, IE you can address everyone on the same line, or you can address a specific radio

* You can tx/rx text messages if you like, to all, a group, or individuals

* The kit includes everything you need to get started, including some basic headsets

* The radios will accept higher-end headsets!

* Can use alkaline batteries, excellent for when the rechargables die

* There is a cloning feature built into the radios, so you can clone the settings and the addressbook, or just the settings. This is great if you have particular settings/channels you need to program into say, 50 radios at once, like our group! Set one radio up, and clone the rest off of it!

* You won't find a better deal on license-free radios, for this price range, ANYWHERE. We have folks in our group who deal in the radio business, and at wholesale pricing, and for the under $80 range for a whole setup, you can't beat these

* Amazon Prime has had the best price on these for awhile, I got mine for $67 shipped. That's less than $38 per radio, including headset and battery

CONS:

* If I had to list a con, I'd say some folks don't like the included headset because it pinches their ears

* Some folks don't like the rechargable batteries because they don't last a solid 8 hours

* NOT WATERPROOF BY ANY STRETCH, not even water-resistant! That's one thing most of my other FRS radios can claim: being water proof. These are not. I've had to take a couple apart to get grease and other stuff out from under the keypad. So ensure you keep these in a pouch of some sort, or under your clothing!

SYNCH ISSUES:

A few years back, this model radio had re-synch issues.. no longer!

BATTERIES:

Half of us use the rechargable batteries, the rest of us use alkalines. The rechargables will work for about 4-6 hours of constant use, depending on weather variables. Alkaline batteries tend to last a full 8 hours.

You'll know when your stuff is dying, because the incoming transmissions seem to go into slow-motion.",usage part group people use typically channel time spread throughout wood usually varying terrain hill mountain thick wood brush sometimes flat land area large acre using radio year scarcely issue able hear loud clear secure reliable easy use keep review short lot folk exhaustingly posted radio give could instead give pro many good thing mention outperforms standard fr system group us mixed terrain flatlands mountain trench heavy wood acre issue secure unlike standard fr even secure model radio thanks encryption private public channel ie address everyone line address specific radio tx rx text message like group individual kit includes everything need get started including basic headset radio accept higher end headset use alkaline battery excellent rechargables die cloning feature built radio clone setting addressbook setting great particular setting channel need program say radio like group set one radio clone rest find better deal license free radio price range anywhere folk group deal radio business wholesale pricing range whole setup beat amazon prime best price awhile got mine shipped le per radio including headset battery con list con say folk like included headset pinch ear folk like rechargable battery last solid hour waterproof stretch even water resistant one thing fr radio claim water proof take couple apart get grease stuff keypad ensure keep pouch sort clothing synch issue year back model radio synch issue longer battery half u use rechargable battery rest u use alkalines rechargables work hour constant use depending weather variable alkaline battery tend last full hour know stuff dying incoming transmission seem go slow motion,"01 10, 2012",A34C9AFFZOI45T,T.

Set-up was difficult because the instructions are not as clear as they should be and are very different from the instructions given on the buttkicker website.  A simple parts list is not included.  Setting it up underneath the couch was fairly painless, but getting the amplifier to get a signal from the processor would not occur unless it was hard-wired.  The wireless set-up would not work.  The red light flashed but would not go out after 10 seconds.  It should have worked, the processor was definitely sending a signal.

Wireless problems:

1.) Instructions with unit said there did not need to be a ""line of sight"" between the transmitter and the receiver, but the instructions on the website said there had to be a direct line of sight between them.

2.)  The website instructions talked about adjusting the ""potentiometer"" on the back of the transmitter, but there is no potentiometer on the back of it to adjust.

3.)  The website offered very little in the way of trouble-shooting this problem.  I will have to call them directly tomorrow to try and resolve this problem.

As far as the ""buttkicking"" goes, we (husband and myself) did not find it a particularly wonderful addition to the home-theater experience.  We put in ""Polar Express"" to test it out and found that it was interesting, but not something we could not live without while watching movies.  It was literally the same experience we had when watching the movie, ""Earthquake"" in the 70's.  The couch and floor vibrated on varying levels depending upon the intensity of what was happening in the movie, and loud low frequencies were heard, but I guess we might have been expecting too much.  When the train in Polar Express was powering up, the shaking and low frequencies were tremendous, but did not necessarily course through our bodies like others have written about.

I think the buttkicking experience would have been much better if we were able to mount it in the center of our couch instead of at one end. Our couch does not have center support leg so we had to place the buttkicker on one far end of it.  Much of the vibration was wasted by going away from the couch.  Possibly ""buttkicker"" could have included an inexpensive substitute adapter in order to place it in the center of couches that don't have a center support.  That would have been great.

We will continue to work on the wireless problem, and if we are able to fix it, that will increase our happiness with the buttkicker.  Otherwise, we will still use the buttkicker, but not as often as we would if it worked wirelessly.  Having to manually connect the amplifier to the processor via wiring every time we want to watch a movie is a pain in the.......butt.",super thrilled buttkicker set difficult instruction clear different instruction given buttkicker website simple part list included setting underneath couch fairly painless getting amplifier get signal processor would occur unless hard wired wireless set would work red light flashed would go second worked processor definitely sending signal wireless problem instruction unit said need line sight transmitter receiver instruction website said direct line sight website instruction talked adjusting potentiometer back transmitter potentiometer back adjust website offered little way trouble shooting problem call directly tomorrow try resolve problem far buttkicking go husband find particularly wonderful addition home theater experience put polar express test found interesting something could live without watching movie literally experience watching movie earthquake couch floor vibrated varying level depending upon intensity happening movie loud low frequency heard guess might expecting much train polar express powering shaking low frequency tremendous necessarily course body like others written think buttkicking experience would much better able mount center couch instead one end couch center support leg place buttkicker one far end much vibration wasted going away couch possibly buttkicker could included inexpensive substitute adapter order place center couch center support would great continue work wireless problem able fix increase happiness buttkicker otherwise still use buttkicker often would worked wirelessly manually connect amplifier processor via wiring every time want watch movie pain butt,"03 29, 2009",A2VH0UT5EQFB6P,loveguitar,,ButtKicker BKA300 Wireless???,1238284800,False,,0

The Surfaces are pricey machines and have gotten some negative press regarding reliability lately, so I was excited to try the Switch Alpha 12 (this machine needs a better name).

After several months with the Acer as my primary machine, I can safely say its really very, very good. It feels every bit as powerful, the screen is fantastic, the case is strong and stable, and everything runs perfectly on it.

Acer has built in a nice system management app that makes setting up the Switch Alpha 12 quite easy, as is restoring it.  Ive used the app a couple of times to wipe the Switch Alpha 12 clean and set it up as a corporate machine and later as a home machine.

I wasn't able to try the Acer touch pen that mates with the Switch (it doesnt come included), but I used the machine all over the country in my office, on flights, in hotels, at conferences, you-name-it and there was never a situation where the machine felt out of place. On planes, the stand allows you to get a nice narrow angle if you're using the tray table.

At a desk (or wherever), Im comfortable using the Switch Alpha 12 with just the device and the keyboard cover, but also tested it using a Dell 24 U2417H display and wireless keyboard and mouse combo the display plugs right in to the Switch Alpha 12 through Mini DisplayPort and works flawlessly.

I installed the usual Office suite (Word/Excel), used it to manage servers, ran SQL server management studio, etc. and the i7 always feels fast! Some have noted the machine gets warm, and I guess it does but never uncomfortably so (at least not while I noticed it).

The keyboard cover is fantastic! I love it on the Surface, and I love it on the Switch Alpha 12. Its a fabric material that magnetically snaps in to place and it stays secure and is a PLEASURE to type on.

Battery life is good, too. I can typically work most of the day (on and off) without needing to carry around the power adapter or worry about it going dead. I doubt I could do an entire full day on one charge.

Overall, for the money, this is an excellent machine and a serious Surface competitor. Ive seen and used a couple others (Dells, Lenovos) and they're always well, not great. The Acer gets everything right and does it at a better price point than the Surface.

The Surface has a slightly better screen (color reproduction, mostly) and I like the Surfaces built-in stand more than Acers.

7904,674562,674562,B01FJFNE5I,,5.0,"In recent years, I've become a big fan of Lenovo.  After having some issues with purchases of an HP, 2 Acers,and a Dell over the past 4 years, I decided to give Lenovo a chance.  The first Lenovo purchase was for two 'Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p 59388313 15.6-Inch Laptop (Dusk Black) ' laptops.  While I found them a bit more expensive than other available laptops of similar specs, I was fed up with the poor performance and/or qualty of prior brands.

It's been about 2.5 years since the purchase of the Y510p laptops.  However, my wife was still using one of the last remaining Acers (a V5 Touch) as of this purchase a little over a month ago.  She could no longer stand to use it.  It had been replaced via Squaretrade maybe 6-8 months earlier and now it too was freezing and just barely responsive at time.  So I jumped on Amazon to find her a new laptop when I stumbled across this one one sale.  It's only been a short time, but this Lenovo has performed admirably.  It is super responsive and fairly lightweight when compared to other laptops, including the the Acer V5 touch.

It provides a strong specs showing at the price point.  It was retailing on Amazon for around $600 or so, but had a sale price of around $515.  However, I think that was PrimeDay and I got it for $400.  Great deal considering the specs:

Intel i5-6200U 2.3GH
8GB RAM
1TB Harddrive
Optical DVD RW drive
HD LED 15.6"" display
High-speed 802.11 a/c
USB 3.0 port
HDMI out
Windows 10

I've played around with it while my wife was away and it is impressive.  I wish I would have picked up a second one, at that price.  So we know have 3 Lenovo laptops and they have operated perfectly.  Even the 2.5 year old Y510p still perform as they did when new (one of which is heavily used for business, streaming, and software development and testing via virtual machines).

Setup was pretty straight-forward and I didn't encounter any problems getting my wireless devices working except for a Brother laser printer.  Re-installation of the printer software and re-doing the network setup for the printer corrected the problem.  I've only been using the router for a few days but judging from my limited experience I would say that this router is amazing.  Signal strength is surprisingly good.  My old router was a Linksys E2000 and I was having signal strength issues on my Sony home entertainment setup using the proprietary Sony network adapter.  Signal strength was 52% at best with the Linksys router.  After I installed the ASUS RT-N66R the signal strength shot up to 100%.  Amazing.  No more problems streaming movies.

It's well over a year since my initial review and since then I have gone back to school and I am now using this daily as my school/work backpack. I routinely carry two large textbooks, three notebooks, and a 14"" laptop in this backpack, along with all my other belongings from my purse so I don't have to carry that around separately. It has ample room for everything I store in it and it's ergonomic design lessens the stress on my back and shoulders as well. From time to time, I do carry my 17"" laptop in this backpack as well and it is close, but it does fit and I love that this backpack has so many uses for me. I'm going camping in October and I plan to bring all my necessities along in this backpack as well. Given it's size, it's able to hold a surprising amount of stuff and I've been known to wear it while crawling through tunnels and going down slides with my son when I have a hard time staying focused on my homework while he's having so much fun on the playground without me! Overall it's become such an integral part of keeping my daily life simple and organized and it's still going strong. No signs of wear anywhere and I expect it to last me the next four years of college as well. Thanks, Targus!

-------------------------------------------------------

One of the first things I noticed about this backpack is the generous padding on the back and shoulder areas. That has always been my number one gripe with backpacks of any kind. Over time they dig into your shoulders and if you have anything heavy in them (ie, a laptop!) the edge of it will rub against my back through the thin material of the backpack. The padding serves two purposes really, comfort and protection of your laptop. While I use my iPad primarily now for mobile computing, I do occasionally find the need to bring my laptop along. Even with only my iPad and accessories and no laptop, I find a lot of value in this backpack. It has an ample amount of organization, including a separate area for your laptop/iPad with a band that goes over the top of the device to ensure that even if the backpack is flipped upside down, your devices won't fall out. It's protected between the heavily padded back and a sturdy separator that keeps it from moving around or bumping into other things inside the backpack. The other side of this separator has plenty of room for books, accessories, or whatever else you might need to bring along with you. The front pouch also has lots of room for more storage and includes built in organizers for pens, notebooks and the like. On the very front is a small pouch that I like to put my bluetooth headset, speakers and chargers in. I love the side pockets too, that provide easy access to it's contents. Perfect place to slip a phone or your keys. Another great addition is the padded handle right between the shoulder straps for when you just want to carry it. Much nicer than toting it around by the shoulder strap. A little surprise bonus that I wasn't aware of was the zippered pouch on the very bottom of the backpack which stores an elasticized rain poncho for putting over the backpack if you get caught in some unfavorable weather. Nice touch! You can also easily slip a water bottle in here with the pouch present. More storage!

On quality, just feeling it you can tell this is high quality, durable material. This isn't your $10 backpack from your local store! The stitching is high quality, no loose threads, no gaps in the stitches. I can't tell you how many backpacks we've had in this family over the years that start splitting seams, zippers falling off, etc, in just a year or two of regular use. I can tell the Terra Backpack is going to last much much longer.

I mentioned the backpack is great for camping as well, and given it's cost I really think it should have multiple uses. I really can't see myself carrying this around on a regular basis due to its size (not any bigger than a traditional backpack, just bigger than what I need on a daily basis) but I can absolutely see myself using this on our annual camping trips. Plenty of room for all my supplies and durable to boot. The rain poncho would really come in handy here! The various clips and loops on the exterior of the backpack would also be very useful for attaching tools and utilities.

874,616121,616121,B014Q70MHI,,5.0,"I bought this Chromebook refurbished from a third party on Walmart.com for  $96.00 and they are carrying it right now on Groupon for $99.00. I own Macbook Pros which I use consistently as well as Windows laptops. When I saw this for the price that I mentioned above I could not resist it! In a nutshell I can truly say that I really like this little Hisense Chromebook. To me it works as fast as my Macbook Pro and maybe a little bit faster! Heck I now use this Chromebook more than I use my Macbook Pro! This thing boots up quickly and you can get right to surfing the internet as soon as possible without a delay.

This little Chromebook is nothing like the Windows netbooks which were the exact same size that I bought just a couple of years ago who would eventually get slow and laggy. This is a browser laptop that works!....and gets the job done for what your trying to do. If it's just surfing the internet or watching videos on Youtube it does what its suppose do and does it right. I didn't think I would like these little Chromebooks, but I can honestly admit I was totally wrong.

This would be the perfect present for someone who cannot afford to buy a computer to use for surfing the internet, or for someone who may own an older laptop/desktop that has began to run at a snails pace but they just don't have the money to buy a new one in this tough economy. Or it can be for someone who may not be so tech savvy such as some Spouses, Grandparents, Parents, in-laws, or that not too tech savvy Uncle, Aunt or cousin who wants to just get the internet for basic purposes.

**UPDATE** 8-2-2016

I had given the Hisense Chromebook to someone who needed a computer. I missed my Hisense Chromebook so much to the point that I just ordered another one, it only cost $84.00, and I just received it a couple of days ago...Let me tell you I am so Happy to have my Hisense Chromebook back with me.  I also wanted to mention that after I bought the first Hisense Chromebook I managed to purchase two more Chromebooks refurbished (Groupon) which is the Acer CB5-571-c4g4 and the Acer CB3-571-c4a5 and that shows how much i've grown to really like Chromebooks. They are both 15.6"" and the perfect size but just like I said I had to repurchase my beloved Hisense Chromebook that I like to use when i'm laying in bed when I don't feel like using my tablets and other laptops. The Hisense Chromebook is truly an EXCELLENT bang for your buck and I never thought that I would say that before I bought the first Hisense Chromebook, and I truly mean that!...Try a Hisense Chromebook for yourself and you will see exactly what I mean.

Functions:

It does function as a removable drive. This was the clincher for me why I upgraded to Hi-MD. Good bye zip discs..... The transfer may not be as fast as a CD Burner but I still like the idea of the external protection of its casing. The method of writing I think is more reliable since it is a magneto-optical device. I was almost tempted to buy a Fujitsu MO drive because of the long wait for its released but instead I found myself buying a portable Toshiba DVD player instead. You can defragment using the windows XP's tool however the .hma files seem impervious to it. I always thought that you have to format the regular MDs to Hi-Mds first in order to use it as a storage device.

Suprisingly, once you drop any file to your sony hi-md removable drive, it automatically creates a management folder thus no intentional ""formatting"" required.

As a music device, for me it is far better than the NetMD. Transfer is a lot faster and the sounds better. Although I have used: Hi-SP and PCM using the sonic stage 2.1, the transfer seems flawless and much faster. Simple Burner transfer is easier to use however. The sound thus far is better than your LP2- 132kbps, but then again it is not fair to compare Hi-SP with LP2. The HD amp has so far delivered for me. The music is far clearer and life-like, in fact for me, music in MD is better than the CD maybe the HD amp plays a role in it. As far as display, the Hi-MD shows the title and the artist unlike NetMD.

The separation of each musical instrument is distinct enough, sensurround if you will, that you'll think the performance is right there in your room.

Based on the available reviews, I did not know what to expect.
I purchased this wire for an electrical project.  I was converting a small battery powered electronic device to run from an AC to DC power adapter.  I used this wire instead of automotive zip wire because I suspected that this speaker wire was better quality.
This wire worked out very well for my application.  I was initially impressed by the flexibility and thickness of the insulation.  When I pulled the wires apart by hand, both wires were still completely covered by insulation.  I had no problems stripping the insulation off the wires using my wire stripper.  I also had no trouble tinning and soldering the speaker wire.  None of the insulation melted when I tinned and soldered the speaker wire.  My spool was a continuous 50 feet (i.e. not spliced together).  Other than being made in China, I have no complaints about this speaker wire.

2024,5258,5258,B000062VUQ,,3.0,"I've had about 4 or 5 sets of computer speakers. I love speakers. I am a audio enthusiast and spend a lot of time upgrading my computer, home, and car sound systems as a hobby. I REALLY wanted to like these speakers. My roommate has them and his have worked perfectly for the six or seven month duration he has had them for. Unfortunately, that is not the case with mine. I ordered these speakers roughly 3 months ago. Since that time, I have had not one, but two control pods with some significant problems. The first one that I had was immediately inoperable. If you touched the volume dial it would distort the sound, and make the volume randomly change to either full volume (if you have heard this speakers, that is LOUD!), or no volume. Once I got this replaced, the new control pod had a defective male plug (the one that goes into the back of your computer) and results in a loud buzzing unless the plug cable is pulled at the perfect angle. Additionally I also get random sound distortion for half a second at a time while I am listening to anything on these speakers.

So far as good things go. My roommate has had these speakers for months and had no problems with them. His work perfectly. When they are working, these speakers are really nice! The highs are fairly crisp, although the lows do have some distortion when the bass is pushed too far. By that, I mean that you sometimes need to put it lower than the recommended setting (which is only about 1/5 of the potential bass) in order to avoid some lows that are not meant to go through the bass from bleeding through. It can make the low male voices in some movies, or music sound a lot more muddy than it should be. Fortunately, this is generally the case when listening to stuff on a very loud volume setting.

I would probably raise my review a star if my speakers had worked as well as my roommates. This is a great system for the price, but you are gambling on getting a good one, or a bad egg.. and from what I have read (after reading a lot of reviews on here I realized that people never really give their products time to have problems before they post a perfect review) on forums, etc. the volume control pod is a major issue ($20 replacement) and you should expect to have to replace it a minimum of one time if you are going to purchase these speakers.

Update 12/12/2013:
I am still using these speakers and still hold a soft spot in my heart for them. However, I would like to make an additional comment about a problem that I had overlooked when originally writing this review. The sound quality is great, but these speakers are incapable of low volume via the knobs on the front of the speaker. If you try to turn the knob below about 20% you'll hear some pretty distorted sound and it will only come out of one speaker (Mine's the left) My roommate has had the same problem and after speaking with another friend that happened to have these speakers he has experienced the same thing. This isn't a horrible issue as you can always change the sound on the computer itself and it won't impact the sound quality, but it's a definite design flaw that is really irritating if you just like to use the hardware to change your sound settings. Aside from that, I am still loving these speakers.",set computer speaker love speaker audio enthusiast spend lot time upgrading computer home car sound system hobby really wanted like speaker roommate worked perfectly six seven month duration unfortunately case mine ordered speaker roughly month ago since time one two control pod significant problem first one immediately inoperable touched volume dial would distort sound make volume randomly change either full volume heard speaker loud volume got replaced new control pod defective male plug one go back computer result loud buzzing unless plug cable pulled perfect angle additionally also get random sound distortion half second time listening anything speaker far good thing go roommate speaker month problem work perfectly working speaker really nice high fairly crisp although low distortion bass pushed far mean sometimes need put lower recommended setting potential bass order avoid low meant go bass bleeding make low male voice movie music sound lot muddy fortunately generally case listening stuff loud volume setting would probably raise review star speaker worked well roommate great system price gambling getting good one bad egg read reading lot review realized people never really give product time problem post perfect review forum etc volume control pod major issue replacement expect replace minimum one time going purchase speaker update still using speaker still hold soft spot heart however would like make additional comment problem overlooked originally writing review sound quality great speaker incapable low volume via knob front speaker try turn knob hear pretty distorted sound come one speaker mine left roommate problem speaking another friend happened speaker experienced thing horrible issue always change sound computer impact sound quality definite design flaw really irritating like use hardware change sound setting aside still loving speaker,"10 12, 2011",ADY1E4CAPP1W1,LopsidedMidget,{'Size:': ' 3-piece'},Whether they are working or not is a gamble.,1318377600,True,4,0

9085,359955,359955,B00BQO4UXW,,5.0,"Great value for a small room.  We have an older Pyle mini-amp downstairs which powers a pair of speakers in our kitchen.  It has worked flawlessly for over 3 years, so I figured I'd give this little guy a shot.  My daughter wanted a better sounding system for her bedroom, so I built her a pair of speakers using MarkAudio CHR-70A drivers.  Paired with this amp, I think it is almost impossible to find a better sounding system for such a modest amount of money.  As for the amp itself, she has had no problems with it.  It has plenty of power for a bedroom system, even using the aforementioned drivers, which have a relatively low 85.4 db sensitivity.  More sensitive drivers could go louder with the same amp.  The sound is nice and clean, with no audible distortion until you really crank the volume up high, which she doesn't do anyway.  Played at normal listening levels, the sound is great.

Love the fact that it takes a USB thumb drive.  For those who may not be familiar with this feature, you simply copy MP3 or WMA files to a thumb drive, then plug the drive into this amp and it will decode and play them.  Super convenient and it sounds great.  We have not had any problems with any files not playing.  It has worked great so far.

A note about the remote - it's a cheesy generic model, but it works.  I don't think Pyle makes the remote - they probably buy it from some el cheapo Chinese manufacturer.  Regardless, it works OK for basic functionality.  You can punch in, for example, 14, and it will go to the 14th song on the USB stick, which is kinda nice.  It works for volume too, but the volume knob on the amp itself is not motorized.  So what this means is that the knob on the amp is sort of a MAXIMUM.  The remote can reduce the volume below what the knob is set at, but it cannot increase it.  Fair enough.  She just sets the knob permanently at about the 12 o'clock position and then adjusts down with the remote.

The aux input works great with her iPod.  So basically, this is the perfect little amp for a kid's bedroom, or for an office, den, or any other smaller room.  Sounds great, loud enough for most people's tastes, and has been reliable so far.  I did have some concerns about long term reliability, but noticed that Amazon is offering 3 years extended warranty for four bucks or something like that.  Pocket change for 3 years peace of mind.

Please not that these tweeters are almost 3 inches deep. So way before you attempt to cut any holes in your car.

You can plan way ahead and find that perfect spot by planning ahead with your wood or your measurements way before you cut your hole. Also note that the hole cut out diameter is correct for the speaker. But the Terminals on the tweeters stick out farther than the cutout diameter. So when you pick out your perfect spot to place these speakers. You will have to trim out about a 1/4 inch more out at only where the terminals protrude from. I would suggest just getting a drill bit that is a hair wider than the terminals and just grind out the 1/4 inch worth of space to get these speakers to go flush. I wouldn't suggest over cutting the entire hole to be bigger just to get the terminals to fit as you will have issues with mounting holes lining up. Other than these suggestions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------Response
from RCA about Commercial Advance before Purchase: Dear Customer:  Thank
you for your inquiry on your product.  During tape playback, the
""Commercial Advance"" feature allows you to avoid watching most
commercials on any recording over 15 minutes long. After the VCR
finishes recording, the Commercial Advance system locates and
electronically marks most of the commercial segments. When the recording
is played back, the VCR scans or fast forwards through the marked
segments. Either a blue screen or the fast motion video of the
commercial itself can be displayed while commercials are being advanced
through.  Commercial Advance reduces three minutes of commercial time to
approximately ten seconds (SLP mode) of fast forwarding time.  We

Feature Definitions and their Use -- Not Applicab le --  Rikki  Thanks
for the response.  My main question was to verify that this RCA Unit,
has  Commercial Scan/Advance  which automatically bypasses commercials
on playback as opposed  to  Commercial Skip in which a button has to be
manually pressed for  each  30-60 seconds.  I do not want the latter.
Does RCA also sell ProScan VCR's? If so, where are they  available?
They are very difficult to locate. I have an old ProScan with
Commercial  Scan which I really liked.  Thanks  Manuel Calcagno  In a

A note to people considering this product What you need to know about Powerline products in general is:

1. They cant be plugged into power strips/surge protectors.
2. You need something on each end. (and by something I mean a Powerline product).
a. For instance if you have a non-Powerline router, you need it to plug into a Powerline adaptor that is plugged directly into the wall.
b. If you buy This particular router its both all in one (thats why its bigger and heavier than most routers).

What I will caution you about is the other end piece.  I read many reviews and people warned me that the wireless adaptor that you would put in a remote location has troubles a few months out.
These claims ARE TRUE so buy at your own risk.

This sub arrived as scheduled. Initially, I was very excited to hook this sub up. The sub is only 150 RMS and 300 watt max but since it is a Kicker product, my expectations were high. I read tons of reviews saying how this is ""the best subwoofer for the price.. period"" and ""Kicks so  hard for the wattage"". Well, maybe.

I'm currently running an 800 watt Visonik Bridgable amp. I will tell you this, this kicker can hit hard, but cannot preform good low bass notes and deep bass. Its really not loud at all. I purchased it thinking it would atleast shake my small car a little (i have a 1993 Chrysler Lebaron) and it hardly does anything. Now i'm not expecting these to be Kicker l7 material or bust my windows out... But Its dissapointing for a kicker product.

I'm asking that you take my word for it because a few reasons. I'm not an amateur nooby car audio kid. I've had a few speakers in my day and i know how to set systems up pretty well. I'm just saying right now, PLEASE LISTEN. If you are looking for your first subwoofer for a small car, then go ahead and by one. Hell maybe two. But if you were like me looking for the short way out of some cheap 12 inch kickers to rattle your car, save yourself the money and purchase a better model or different brand. This kicker can't really even keep up with a cheap Sony XPLOD from walmart (which you would be paying about the same amount)

My 12 inch 80 dollar Sony XPLOD from walmart rails way harder than this. Please don't take everyone elses word over mine.

The key is to use the underwater mode so the white balance is decent.

It may be possible to fix this in post processing, but I don't think most tools like iMovie make it easy to fix this.

A flash in slightly murky water leads to an interesting-only-in-the-first-shot twinkling star effect. All the bits of junk floating in the water reflect the light of the flash and you get lots of burned out tiny spots instead of murky water.

The audio output is high impedance both inverting and non-inverting, on the PWB. The player has a front panel mini phone jack low impedance output that will drive a 23kOhm load but not headphones.  The player is supplied with cables to plug into the PWB connectors.  The player is supplied without a case, without a power supply, and without input and output RCA connectors requiring that you supply these items to construct the module into a usable MP3 player.  The unit is supplied with a battery for the remote.  The MP3 player has a bright display and remembers the track being played, the FM setting and the volume setting.  No manual is supplied.  I verified the use of a 16 GB TF card.  Using a TF card is convenient in that the card does not protrude from the front panel as USB or SD card would.  The remote does not have a fast forward setting.  Bass and Midrange performance are superb.

If you are not handy in building electronics equipment, I would give this unit a pass.  If you realize this module will require some assembly and installation, and are handy in building electronics equipment you will be rewarded with excellent MP3 player performance.

I installed MP3 Module in Radio Shack plastic Box (2.13 X 4.00 X 6.00).  I used the screw on panel of the Radio Shack case as the base for the device. I Added rubber feet (Waxman Super Sliders Bumpers  inch 0 74523 02153 8) to the box.  I added a 12V input connector (Sunkee DC Power Jack, Screw Nut DIY 180 Degree X00017GVIL) and color coded (white/red) RCA input jacks (Radio Shack Gold plated, mount with nut).  I used a Radio Shack 1.5-12V 500 m A power supply for the tests.  Best performance (to eliminate popping noise on output) was with a 6 Volt setting even though the description indicates that it will work 8-14. Vdc.

The FM player is programmed by selecting FM mode with the remote and then pressing the RPT button.  After that the stations are selected by entering a two digit code.  The FM player brought in one local station without an antenna.

The MP3 player has 6 equalization settings.  With the equalization setting EQ1 the player response is flat from 8 Hz to 20kHz with a 23kOhm load.  The EQ is not saturating and makes very small changes to the frequency balance. The digitizing frequency is not filtered from the output waveform but unlikely to be audible.

The Module has excellent performance and will require the addition of an amplifier to drive speakers and adjust the tone.

4907,93822,93822,B001OI2VXG,,3.0,"I have several Canon digital cameras, so when I decided to purchase a camcorder I immediately went to Canon.  I waited a month for this new version.  I wanted a small camcorder--and this is definitely small.

I am a bit disappointed in the quality of the videos.  For movies taken in full light I can hardly tell the difference between these movies and the ones I take with my Canon PowerShot A570 IS digital camera! Although, the sound is definitely better with the camcorder.  For movies in dim light (I filmed my son's Jazz concert), there was a huge difference so I decided to keep the camera.

I would agree with the previous reviewer in that the control buttons on the LCD screen are practically useless in dark settings.  I couldn't see them during the concert I filmed.

I also have a bit of trouble holding the camera because it is so small.  I removed the ""grip belt"" strap it came with because I could not get it to fit securely and still allow me to adjust the buttons at the same time.  It felt like the camera was going to slide off my hand. I now use the extra wrist strap that comes with the camera and while it doesn't look as ""cool"", I'm not worried about dropping the camera.

My biggest hassel has been that the camera saves the movie files as MOD files which are a pain to work with! They will not import into most video editing programs (including Adobe Premiere Elements!), and the widescreen videos will not play correctly in Windows Media Player unless you convert the file.

The camera comes with a software program to transfer, edit, and view the movies--but it is awkward to use and even with the conversion I still could not get the movies to import into Camtasia Studio 6, which is the program I use the most.  So, after two days of internet searching this is what I found that works for me.

1. I use a card reader to transfer the movie files onto my computer. This is much easier for me than using the program that comes with the camera.

2. I downloaded a free copy of SDCopy, and I use it to convert the MOD files to mpeg files.  If I check the ""widescreen"" box on the converting window the converted movies will play widescreen in Windows Media Player.

3. The converted movies will import into Adobe Premiere, but they will not import into Camtasia Studio 6 (which is my goal). I can use Adobe Premiere to convert the files to avi files, but the process takes too long for me so I found a better and easier way.

4. I purchased a MOD converter.  The one I decided on was Daniusoft Mod Converter for $29.  It works well. With a MOD converter, I can convert the MOD files to a bunch of other types that will import into other programs as well as play on other devices such as an ipod.

3714,35429,35429,B0009204RI,,4.0,"Pros: Solid build quality, useful features, easy programming, good range, good false alert filtering, voice alerts, Ku band (for European drivers)

Cons: Volume could be louder, no rear-facing radar antenna or arrows, mode does not automatically switch to multi-threat display upon multiple radar encounters, not immune to all RDDs

Overall, this is an excellent radar detector. It looks great in my windshield (I drive a '98 Honda Civic with a hardwire kit), and the suction cups work well. It has three modes: City, Autoscan, and Highway. I mainly use Autoscan and Highway. The false alert filtering is so good that I rarely use City mode. It is easy to program and to turn off certain bands. There are also four brightness settings, which make it easy to adjust according to light conditions. The detection range is excellent, especially in Upstate New York, where the police are too stupid to use instant-on and I can detect them from a mile away.

Now for the negatives. With wind noise at highway speeds and the radio on, it is sometimes hard to hear, even at full volume. I wish that the speaker was just a little bit louder. There are also no arrows or rearward-facing radar antennae, such as in the Valentine One. During highway cruising, this leaves me guessing whether the cop is ahead of me or behind. I usually just slow down and wait to see if I pass him or if he passes me, and then speed back up again once I identify the threat and see that it is safe. Another thing that I do not understand is the multi-threat display. When multi-threat display is activated, it shows the band and signal strength of each threat, simultaneously. This is very useful when there are two or more police radar threats in the area or when there is one real threat and one false alert (from an automatic door opener, for example). This works even better than the V1 ""Bogey Counter,"" because it shows the signal strength of each individual threat, instead of just flashing the number of threats and the signal strength of the strongest one. In most situations, when there is only one threat to pay attention to, the normal display is much easier to read with signal strength bars, much like a cell phone battery meter. It would be ideal if the normal mode could be used at all times, and the detector could automatically switch to multi-threat display upon encountering multiple threats. Instead, the detector remains locked in one mode, and does not change unless it is programmed. This means that if normal mode is activated (this is what what most drivers want), it stays in normal mode and only displays one threat at a time, ignoring the other, even when there are two or more simultaneous threats. This leaves the driver with an annoying decision to make : leave the detector in multi-threat display mode and have less easy-to-read warnings, or leave it in normal mode and not know when there is more than one threat to be aware of.

All in all, this is a great detector. I have never used a Valentine One, but from what I have read and researched, this is the better detector for most drivers, due to the better ergonomics, ease of use, cheaper price, voice alerts, and reduced false alarms. Don't hook up this Beltronics (or any other detector) to your windshield and expect to be exempt from speeding tickets. Rather, learn how radar detectors work and how to use them, and understand their weaknesses and blind spots. LIDAR (police laser) is becoming more and more widely used, and laser jammers are essential for anyone seeking adequate protection from speed traps. Although radar detectors can detect laser, they are useless as a form of protection. Radar can be detected long before the officer can read your speed, but by the time your detector alerts you of laser, the officer already has your speed. As far as radar detection goes, the Rx65 does an excellent job and I highly recommend it. If you are a trucker or if you live in Virginia, Washington DC, or Canada, remember to get the Bel STi, because the Rx65 is not immune to all RDDs (radar detector detectors)

I was using some old, but still beautiful Dell UltraSharps (so I don't like to see washed out blacks, which I don't see).  This monitor is pretty impressive.  The power bricks gets hot, this thing burns over 100 watts I believe (not surprising when you think about it).  For the money, I give it five stars.  No real complaints.  I hope it lasts.

Also, go into the menu and turn down the brightness.  Factory defaults are too high, at least for me.

UPDATE 2 Days Later
I'm no longer going to be able to live without 2560x1440 resolution.  So much easier to move all my development windows around, find them, look at them without having to click on them.

Because this is a supremely under-stressed HTPC application, I am not running overclocked.  I've had zero issues with my system.  It runs extremely cool and quiet. It is very stable. I'm very happy with it.

This seems to be a well built, high quality motherboard, with many features. I purchased it on ebay for $128 with free shipping.

I am able to overclock my i5-6600k CPU to 4400 MHz simply by bumping the multiplier up to 44, while leaving the CPU Load Line Calibration at it's lowest level. This keeps the voltage and heat low. I was able to bring the clock up to 4600 MHz by bumping the voltage to a fixed 1.35, but this pulls more power and generates more heat and fan noise than I like. 4700 was too much with my limited knowledge, and my reluctance to go past 1.35v, I was able to push the integrated GPU to 1400 as well. I imagine I could get more out of it if I knew more about the intricacies of overclocking, but it shows what this board is capable of with just a modicum of knowledge and air cooling.

My setup utilizes an Intel i5-6600k CPU, an EVGA GTX750 Ti SC, 2x4gb sticks of Crucial 2133 DDR4, a Crucial MX200 2.5"" SSD, a 3TB WD Green HDD, a LG WH16NS40 Blu-ray Disc Rewriter, an EVGA SuperNOVA 550 G2 PSU, Case ventilation is provided by a pair of Noctua NF-F12 PWM Cooling Fans on intake duty, and a Noctua NF-P12 PWM fan on exhaust duty. The case is a Cooler Master Silencio 352 mATX. Everything fits perfectly.

This was my first build in over 10 years. I built it to be a HTPC, and it is performing admirably. The board connectors worked out ok for my build. I do wish the battery was in a more open place, as my CPU cooler and video card block access to it. Likewise, the CPU cooler fan connection is under the cooler when it is installed. I would have preferred that the SATA connectors were oriented vertically, rather than parallel at the edge, but I was able to make it work.

I did have trouble installing Windows 7. Skylake drops Legacy USB support, so USB keyboards won't work without going into the BIOS to enable the OS/2 port simulator. Due to the fact that I did not have a DVI-D capable monitor or DVI-D to VGA converter, I was unable to get into the BIOS. I was unable to see the BIOS screen on my TV until I turned off the HD setting in the BIOS, once I had gotten a DVI-D to VGA active converter. This would also not have been an issue with the GTX-750 video card, but I had not yet decided to get it yet. I used the USB Patcher that comes on the driver CD and on the Asrock website, but that wound up getting me only to the first screen of the setup, where you are supposed to give the PC a name. I tried many other workarounds, but what finally did the trick was buying a used PS/2 keyboard. This allowed me to get into Windows, and then the driver disk did the rest.

One issue I have been seeing is that the BIOS screen freezes up occasionally. The mouse pointer will still move, but mouse clicks and keyboard commands no longer have any effect. When this happens, I have to Control Alt Delete to reboot. This seems to have no effect on Windows 7 stability, and some times it will happen repeatedly, and then other times, it won't happen for a long while.

Overall, I am pretty happy with this board. It represents a good feature set and quality for the money.",month update supremely stressed htpc application running overclocked zero issue system run extremely cool quiet stable happy seems well built high quality motherboard many feature purchased ebay free shipping able overclock k cpu mhz simply bumping multiplier leaving cpu load line calibration lowest level keep voltage heat low able bring clock mhz bumping voltage fixed pull power generates heat fan noise like much limited knowledge reluctance go past v able push integrated gpu well imagine could get knew intricacy overclocking show board capable modicum knowledge air cooling setup utilizes intel k cpu evga gtx ti sc x gb stick crucial ddr crucial mx ssd tb wd green hdd lg wh n blu ray disc rewriter evga supernova g psu case ventilation provided pair noctua nf f pwm cooling fan intake duty noctua nf p pwm fan exhaust duty case cooler master silencio matx everything fit perfectly first build year built htpc performing admirably board connector worked ok build wish battery open place cpu cooler video card block access likewise cpu cooler fan connection cooler installed would preferred sata connector oriented vertically rather parallel edge able make work trouble installing window skylake drop legacy usb support usb keyboard work without going bios enable o port simulator due fact dvi capable monitor dvi vga converter unable get bios unable see bios screen tv turned hd setting bios gotten dvi vga active converter would also issue gtx video card yet decided get yet used usb patcher come driver cd asrock website wound getting first screen setup supposed give pc name tried many workarounds finally trick buying used p keyboard allowed get window driver disk rest one issue seeing bios screen freeze occasionally mouse pointer still move mouse click keyboard command longer effect happens control alt delete reboot seems effect window stability time happen repeatedly time happen long overall pretty happy board represents good feature set quality money,"12 1, 2015",AOA0XDHSL5GRY,Wells Bengston,,"Feature packed mATX Z170 Motherboard,",1448928000,False,23,1

I started to peel the tab to take off the protection on the adhesive side, but the tab came off without anything else. After picking at it for a few minutes I was finally able to remove the plastic protection. After that I started to apply it to the iPad but had a much more difficult time than on my iPhone.

7741,72288,72288,B000UY3NR8,,5.0,"What a sweet little mouse. I really like it. I especially like having it connect wirelessly through bluetooth - a technology I wasn't using enough. I use a bluetooth headset for my cellphone, but that's it. I also liked freeing up a USB port.

It's small and fits my hand really well. It is contoured and has distinct ""wells"" for your left and right button fingers to rest in. The Apple mouse, being completely smooth, was not a comfortable fit for me. The top is white and the sides are silver-colored. It matches my new iMac and keyboard better than the all-white Mighty Mouse. This is the type of mouse that should come with Apple computers.

I installed the software, rebooted the iMac and turned the mouse on. It recognized it right away and I was off and running.

9036,692662,692662,B000MEI592,,4.0,"I'll list my pros and cons:

Pros:
-Great radio reception.
-Can be programmed to turn on, record radio, then turn off.  That's the main reason I bought it.
-Can do line-in MP3 recording
-Has a detachable MP3 player.
-Great speaker for unit it's size.
-If you use rechargable batteries (AA size), they can be recharged in the unit.

Cons:
-The user manual is awful.  For several of the functions it ""put me in the ballpark"" but I had to figure out the rest myself.  Very frustrating.  An owner's manual shouldn't be so bad.
-The programmed radio recording doesn't give you as much time as the Pogo.  Your only given three recording slots and each goes 99 minutes maximum for a total of 297  minutes.  The Pogo can record all day long if you have a huge SD memory card and a low memory record setting.
-Memory of MP3 player is small and there is no expansion slot.
-Programming the unit for auto turn on and record is clumsy and can be frustrating.

Other issues:

I have had the MP3 player hang up on me.  I had to format it with the computer's built in software to get it to work again.  Since then it hasn't had a problem.  (The included disk is almost worthless!)

If you import your own frequencies by editting the FREQ.TXT off the desk, make sure you chop off the notes from the bottom of the text or it won't work.  The manual doesn't tell you this.  I like how you can load up your own frequencies with your own ID's for each.

Keep in mind that there is difference in short press and long press for the radio on/off button.  Long press off keeps the radio on but shuts off the screen.

In summary:  If your impatient then I don't recommend this unit as the user manual is terrible.  If you're patient and like to fiddle with things then eventually you'll figure this unit out and will be able to enjoy it.

22,85578,85578,B00133WX4E,,5.0,"I have to hand it to Pioneer - they found a way to give a head unit the longest possible life.  In the ""old days"" (think Eight Track Cartridge), when you bought a head unit, it pretty much did one thing - provide music from one source and maybe AM/FM.  If you wanted to get the latest new music source on the market you had to ditch the whole head unit and start again.  Remember how eight-tracks became bricks when cassettes got to the point where you could get pretty good sound from them?  Remember how cassettes became fire starters when it became possible to burn your own CD's and play them in the car?  Yup.  Out with the old, in with the new...

I guess if you don't keep your cars long and you sell the stereo with the car, it might not matter very much.  But if tend to hold on to things, it's nice when you can update them as things change.  Such is the case with a whole range of Pioneer head units.

Pioneer provides an IP-BUS connection system with several tiers of functionality ranges, depending on the age and feature range of your particular head unit.  Later units at the higher end of the line support more IP-BUS compatible components, with a better selection of control and display options.

My first IP-BUS unit is still in my Jeep and providing me great service - running both an XM radio and iPod.  Neither was available when I bought my Pioneer but both were easy to add and have really enhanced the life of the head unit.  I still have it and use it everyday.

My second IP-BUS unit (DEH-P980BT) has proven the incredible extensibility of this system.  It already had huge built-in capabilities.  But adding to it was easy:
- XM Radio
- iPod
- USB

And now HD Digital Radio.

What's not to like?

There is some moaning and groaning about the interface.  I will grant that my unit treats the HD Digital radio as an ""external"" device with limited character display, but still has a considerable number of features that are easy to control.

And the sound is exactly what HD Radio is all about.  I took a no compromise approach to the installation.  I wired it to an auxiliary fuse panel (like Painless Wiring) and added an antenna splitter so that both the regular AM/FM and this unit had antenna connections.  That preserves my option to use the original AM/FM tuner for whatever reason I might have.  The instruction manual is weak on this point suggested to leave the AM/FM in the head unit disconnected from the antenna.  And when you read the reviews here you see all those disappointed with that advice.  For a couple dollars you can avoid all that.

This item is easy to stash inside the dash - most cars will have enough unused space to hide this easily - in fact I have all IP-BUS units hidden in the dash with room to spare.

I ended up getting this for a small fraction of the price with the HD Radio rebate, well worth skipping a couple breakfasts at the fast food place!",hand pioneer found way give head unit longest possible life old day think eight track cartridge bought head unit pretty much one thing provide music one source maybe fm wanted get latest new music source market ditch whole head unit start remember eight track became brick cassette got point could get pretty good sound remember cassette became fire starter became possible burn cd play car yup old new guess keep car long sell stereo car might matter much tend hold thing nice update thing change case whole range pioneer head unit pioneer provides ip bus connection system several tier functionality range depending age feature range particular head unit later unit higher end line support ip bus compatible component better selection control display option first ip bus unit still jeep providing great service running xm radio ipod neither available bought pioneer easy add really enhanced life head unit still use everyday second ip bus unit deh p bt proven incredible extensibility system already huge built capability adding easy xm radio ipod usb hd digital radio like moaning groaning interface grant unit treat hd digital radio external device limited character display still considerable number feature easy control sound exactly hd radio took compromise approach installation wired auxiliary fuse panel like painless wiring added antenna splitter regular fm unit antenna connection preserve option use original fm tuner whatever reason might instruction manual weak point suggested leave fm head unit disconnected antenna read review see disappointed advice couple dollar avoid item easy stash inside dash car enough unused space hide easily fact ip bus unit hidden dash room spare ended getting small fraction price hd radio rebate well worth skipping couple breakfast fast food place,"10 29, 2008",A3REK3OFONWB1Q,Paul M.

Therefore we wanted a basic, entry level 5.1 Receiver an pair it with DVD player that can be replaced at lower cost if it failed again. We originally settled for the Yamaha V375 for $249 which receives excellent reviews everywhere. However, this Pioneer popped up as a daily deal for $179.99 and I couldn't resist. Set-up wasn't overly difficult. Getting the speaker cables hooked up was the toughest part. I'm not an expert, but so far my equipment always had simple push connectors. These screw connectors are a pain in the neck. I had a flashlight in my mouth and fumbled quite  a while to get all speakers connected. I then discovered that our existing subwoofer from the home theater system wouldn't work with this receiver. It requires a powered subwoofer so I ended up paying another $89.95 to buy a powered subwoofer. I hardwired the receiver to my router through an ethernet switch and connected the TV with an optical audio cable. Once set up it worked like a charm. I need the manual (only comes as a pdf on a CD) to be able to use the advanced features on the remote (which I really don't need). The sound is more than sufficient for our needs and much better than the old system. We are glad, that we bought this unit because of it's advanced connectivity compared to the Yamaha. The ipod connects and gets charged through USB - which is great - but selecting songs from the playlist with the remote is not very convenient compared to doing it on the ipod screen. We haven't used AirPlay. We do love the internet radio !!  Again, accessing them through the remote isn't very convenient. It's far easier to set the radio stations up online and save them to favorites. The tablet remote control didn't work well for us. It kept giving us connectivity errors and we ended up using it.

My first impression, out of the box is, I'm impressed.  It seems to act just like my Android phone.  It is very responsive for a 1GHz cpu.

The instructions that come with it are non-existent, a card with where the buttons are.  Their support page gives a URL error.  Their FAQs has no entries except for the specs.

Cons:
* The sound is very tinny.  It is not very good, especially compared to my friend's iPad.
*  No rear facing camera.  So this is only good for chat.  Can't really take pictures or use a scanner app.  A little disappointing.
* The auto-brightness doesn't work very well for me.  I think it makes the display too dark under all lighting conditions.
* It cannot play trailers from apple.com/trailers.
* The system tutorial in Settings->About Tablet doesn't work.  It just returns to the previous screen.
* Android 2.2 is not designed for tablets.  Google said this.
* The wireless can use 802.11n but only the 2.4GHz band and not the less cluttered 5GHz band.
* My biggest complaint is that both the on/off and the volume buttons are very hard to use.  They are too small or too recessed.

Pros:
* The display is very nice and a good size.
* Price, though I think they could have sprung for more than a 4gb card.  Even my phone came with 8bg card.
* Battery life seems real good.  I've been using it for over 3 hours over two days and it is at 56%.
* The Android system is a plus.  I hope it can be upgraded to 3.0+
*  It comes with the Kindle app installed and ebooks look real nice.  I do still like my Kindle better since it is so much lighter.
* Touch screen is very sensitive.  I find if I press too hard, it doesn't work. But of course that kind of sensitivity can be bad too, because I press things I don't mean to all the time.

Some other notes:  I tried Firefox mobile on it.  It doesn't feel like Firefox and the password manager doesn't allow for a master password and that made me nervous.  Also flash did not work with Firefox, so I removed it.  I do not like the generic Browser on Android.  So I will be looking for a new one.

I installed the ""Hackers Keyboard"" from the app store and really like that.  No more hunting around for special keys, they are all there.

I played some games that required interaction of the touch screen and the motion detections system.  Both worked very well.

You might think from all my cons that I don't like this tablet, but that is incorrect.  Most of the cons are nits.  If you are looking for a device that you can sit on the couch with, browse the web and check email, this is it.  It would be nice if the speakers sounded better (I'm looking for an equalizer app) and if the buttons were easier to use, but this is a very nice device for $350.

Update 5-30-11
As of today, I would NOT buy this tablet.  It does somethings nice, but many things including Netflix don't work and Le Pan has not plans to upgrade this to Andriod 2.3 let alone 3.0 or above.  They make a nice tablet and plan to release another 9.7 with 3.0, so I would wait.

Update 7-24-12
Now that I can, I've changed the rating to 2 star.  It was an okay tablet while it worked with the flaws mentioned above.  But as I suspected, they never updated the software.
Also, the Wi-Fi died.

Featuring a whole 3 HDMI inputs into 1 HDMI output, with no external power required.

The front face of the device has 3 HDMI female ports, for all video in. They are all nice and tight, and will hold your cables in their place well. The cable coming out, is obviously, HDMI video out. It is a good foot in length, and will reach the distance easy (with the addition of your previous cables' lengths). The top of the device is where the real meat is, the piece that makes it all work. A simple 1 button click will switch from input 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. With a bright, and I mean very bright, blue LED to indicate which video is being brought through. I find that the LED is way too bright, and makes the device stick out too much. I like having cables all over the place, but I do not like them being the main attraction. A simple defuse would make great on the LEDs. Even a simple frost. I find that the practical design of the device to not be very helpful, as if it was designed to just hang in the air (despite its flat bottom with rubber holders). A more helpful design would have been moving all the HDMI's to the back, and have the LEDs/switch(s) in the front. This would have allowed for someone to place the device in a location on their entertainment center, where it is easy to find, and even easier to control. Currently, I have to do a lot of stretching behind my TV to reach the button, since the design does not allow it to easily sit on any surface (Nor do I have any tools to stick it to the wall).

The overall functionality of it works great, and it is at a greatly low cost. The name of the product shows that it has been modified at least once, and I am curious at what changes it may have been, since the changes cannot be easily found. I would suggest this product if you are looking for a cheap HDMI adapter to allow an extra 2 HDMI inputs to your set, and you have an easy ability to reach behind your TV.

- iPod & iPod photo lines merged; no more iPod photo 30 GB
- iPod comes in two capacities - 20 GB ($299), 60 GB ($399) with color screen & photo support
- U2 iPod (20 GB) down to $329 from $349 - with color screen & photo support
- iPod shuffle 1 GB down to $129 from $149
- iPod 60 GB down to $399 from $449
- new version of iTunes (4.9) that support podcasts
***************************************

Today (23 Feb 2005), Apple announced a major change in its iPod lineup and here is how it affects iPod photo models:
> iPod 40 GB is discontinued
> iPod photo 40 GB is discontinued
> iPod photo 30 GB (new product) replaces the 40 GB iPod photo and the regular iPod 40 GB
> iPod photo 60 GB now costs $150 less -- $449 instead of $599
> iPod photo 30 GB costs $349 ($150 less than iPod photo 40 GB and $50 less than regular iPod 40 GB)
> iPod dock ($39), AV cable ($19), carrying case ($29), and firewire cable ($19) do not ship with iPod photo (you may not really need them)
> Now we get three things with iPod photo: earphones, USB (not firewire) based AC adapter, USB 2.0 cable
> In additon to the above, a firewire cable continues to ship with iPod 20 GB & iPod U2 edition
> iPod photo Camera Connector is introduced - this can be used for connecting your digital camera directly to the iPod

Since I have iPod 40 GB as well as iPod photo 60 GB, I strongly recommend iPod photo for those who are looking beyond the iPod 20 GB. The color screen has much better resolution and it also has a scrolling feature for long texts.",latest update ipod family ipod ipod photo line merged ipod photo gb ipod come two capacity gb gb color screen photo support u ipod gb color screen photo support ipod shuffle gb ipod gb new version itunes support podcasts today feb apple announced major change ipod lineup affect ipod photo model ipod gb discontinued ipod photo gb discontinued ipod photo gb new product replaces gb ipod photo regular ipod gb ipod photo gb cost le instead ipod photo gb cost le ipod photo gb le regular ipod gb ipod dock av cable carrying case firewire cable ship ipod photo may really need get three thing ipod photo earphone usb firewire based ac adapter usb cable additon firewire cable continues ship ipod gb ipod u edition ipod photo camera connector introduced used connecting digital camera directly ipod since ipod gb well ipod photo gb strongly recommend ipod photo looking beyond ipod gb color screen much better resolution also scrolling feature long text,"02 23, 2005",A30AXUOZHZ1T61,H.

I wanted something similar to Apple's earbuds that have that rubber design to help prevent slippage out of the ear, and these have that feature.  Audio from these headphones are better than I had expected. Highs are good, but the bass was surprising.  I had read other reviews that said bass was lacking, but there is some bass in there; not the sort that you'd receive from costlier in-ear/noise cancelling sets, but it's not like there isn't any at all. Probably from a scale of 1 to 10 in bass, they're a 6-7.  Overall comfort is good too. For my medium-small ears they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I've used them while washing my car (not that they're water-proof, just an example of time worn), walking around, jogging, and just music listening. Again, I especially love the rubber lining on the earbuds, as they help prevent the headphones from slipping out of my ears.

The only feature I don't seem to find use for is the built-in clips.  They're designed to clip onto your shirt when not in use, but when I'm not using them I just put them away in my pocket... =\

I balked at getting it at first, because of the cost, but the lack of set-up frustration, the versatility of camera positioning options and the online viewing options make it worth every penny.  I took advantage of getting the fourth camera at the reduced price when I got the three camera system, and I'm so glad I did.  Now, I want to get at least one, maybe two more cameras!

I share viewing access rights with relatives, and,  as the Arlo account admin, have complete control of every aspect of every camera option using my iPhone.

 The cameras are consistently up 100% of the time, which is absolutely critical.  Unlike other systems Arlo lets you control the duration of recording from 10 seconds up to two minutes, which is fantastic.  I know of no other camera system that lets you create rules, like Arlo does, that will trigger a second camera to record when the first camera detects motion.

The camera batteries, 4 for each camera, are lithium CR 123A. They're a bit pricey.  But it looks like they're on their way to the four to six month lifespan Arlo claims  since they each show four full bars on my iPhone''s Arlo app, and have been on 24x7 for the last month.  I also added the black rubber camera coverings which makes the white cameras less obvious.

To hit the correct button for the alarm function and the on-off button I had to glue on touch pads to raise the height of the buttons so touch in-the-dark was possible.

The assumed newer model has automatic time adjusting however it is off by one hour and needs to be manually adjusted for correct time.

5455,222287,222287,B004WNLOHO,,5.0,"I have 3 HP DL360 servers, each equipped with 4 Intel SSD's in a RAID 5 configuration.  As the load on each of these servers increased, I needed an easy way of adding more storage without buying additional servers.  The Sans Digital external TowerRAID seemed to be exactly what I was looking for and so far, after 3 weeks of testing in our development environment, it has worked beautifully.

The TowerRAID was ordered along with four Intel 120 GB SSD's.  We carved out 3 virtual machines running on the server, each using TowerRAID as the primary drive.  The VM's being used are primarily as web servers running IIS and as a report server.  In each case, performance between the HP DL360's internal RAID drives (also using Intel SSD's) and the TowerRAID is indistinguishable. The TowerRAID is connected using the eSata controller which came with it.

Since we had decided for reliability reasons to use Intel SSD's, the option of running Sata III was not an issue.  Intel's SSD's run at a maximum of 3G whereas new SSD's using a Sandforce controller, will run faster.  But for us that wasn't an option without replacing the internal RAID controllers on each of the HP servers.  Plus, the nature of our application is such that it's running a large number of small SQL Server databases and running ASP and ASP dot net.  The ability to quickly find small amounts of data in the database or to quickly run one of the 750 ASP programs comprising the system is critical to maintaining high performance.  The Intel SSD's are absolutely perfect for this since their access times are way faster than a traditional hard drive and at the same time we aren't flooding the controller with lots of data.

So far the TowerRAID provides performance on par for our application with the internal RAID controller and it offered an easy way to expand SSD storage.  And since it provides a fifth drive bay that I'm currently not using, I can easily expand storage further by simply adding one more drive.  We will probably purchase at least 2 more TowerRAID controllers for the two physical servers as the storage needs of our application continue to grow.",hp dl server equipped intel ssd raid configuration load server increased needed easy way adding storage without buying additional server sans digital external towerraid seemed exactly looking far week testing development environment worked beautifully towerraid ordered along four intel gb ssd carved virtual machine running server using towerraid primary drive vm used primarily web server running ii report server case performance hp dl internal raid drive also using intel ssd towerraid indistinguishable towerraid connected using esata controller came since decided reliability reason use intel ssd option running sata iii issue intel ssd run maximum g whereas new ssd using sandforce controller run faster u option without replacing internal raid controller hp server plus nature application running large number small sql server database running asp asp dot net ability quickly find small amount data database quickly run one asp program comprising system critical maintaining high performance intel ssd absolutely perfect since access time way faster traditional hard drive time flooding controller lot data far towerraid provides performance par application internal raid controller offered easy way expand ssd storage since provides fifth drive bay currently using easily expand storage simply adding one drive probably purchase least towerraid controller two physical server storage need application continue grow,"01 2, 2012",A26IPLV3CMD7I6,Thomas matthews,,Expanding RAID storage when your 1U server maxes out,1325462400,True,4,1

It was delivered in just a few days as expected and I installed it; the machine booted as expected and I was a happy camper having 16 Gigs for my RAM hungry programs. I noticed that many operations were slowing down and the Spinning Wheel of Death (SPOD) was the norm and not the exception. I searched for answers in on line forums, talking to friends, and anyone who would listen, there were no real answers. After over a year living with all this I decided I needed more RAM.

I returned to Amazon, and when I searched for RAM the Komputerbay page came up and there was a yellow banner at the top which told me that I had ordered this over a year ago; however there was a notice at the top of the page which read ""This RAM is for PC only"", now this notice was not there a year ago or if it was I hadn't noticed it. I went to another page on Amazon for the RAM and this page had a banner which read ""This RAM is for MAC only, I promptly ordered it, it came in a few days, I removed the other RAM, installed the new ram; problem solved, windows, programs, and everything was snapping open lightning fast and no more SPOD.

Amazon, has an area where you can communicate with sellers and they monitor all emails through this portal. I explained what had happened and in less than 24 hours I had a response from Komputerbay stating that they would replace my original purchase with the MAC specific type even though it was over a year since the original order, and apologized for any inconvenience.

I was skeptical at first because no reviews touched on how they perform on an airplane. It's actually very good. I find that you have to push them in though and it is almost quiet when you do.

Even if they sit loosely in your ears you can still hear what you are listening to over the drone of the engines. You would have to turn the volume up a little louder but I am very impressed. I also own Plane Quiet NC7 Noise Canceling Headphones and these work decent but find they sit tight and hurt my ears after a while and do not block out the engine noise as well.

The Ultimate Ears come with a small plastic case and fit in your pocket comfortably, pants or shirt. A lot easier to travel with and I prefer these over the Plane Quiet which is bulky (not as bulky as a Bose where it looks like you are wearing big muffins), it came with a nice case but that doesn't make up for the travel inconvenience.

First steps were discouraging, although setup is easy, device connects well via USB and connection to Logitech is smooth. Problems started after that, as I was adding more and more components and Harmony's auto setup steps failed to configure everything properly, but in part due to some of my errors and a few small details I overlooked.

Setting up components is fairly simple and Logitech's database does most of the work for you. It is, however, EXTREMELY important to understand how ""Activities"" function works and how it needs to be configured. This is the core of Harmony's ""brain"" and if you fail there, you'll be quite disappointed with it, like so many negative reviews here suggest.

To make a long story short, after a couple of days playing with the device I love it! Once you fully understand how to set it up and tweak it, it's absolutely great. Have all my AV in the house on this single unit, some nine or ten of them and all work great. Even some older components, including some old DVD player, another not so common brand and somewhat old cable box (actually, both of my cable boxes are not that new, just about to upgrade to HD-DVR, so I was pleasantly surprised that Harmony ""recognized"" them without any problem).

I yet have to experiment and use this remote more. Didn't give it five stars just because of occasional goofy behavior, but certainly nothing too bad, worrisome or too annoying.

People who gave one star reviews to this toy probably got frustrated right in the beginning and/or failed to understand and follow ALL instructions very carefully. Given an amazing number of supported components, both old and new, I find it hard to believe that customers could not make them work properly. I suspect human error in majority of cases. Once you set up Harmony properly and start using it, you'll see how convenient and even intuitive it is. Nice design, too. I was thinking about getting another one, but most of the components it controls are in a single room that I use 80% of the time. When I want to use others in other rooms, I just take Harmony with me. Fortunately, other family members haven't gotten hooked to it yet so they don't care. Once they do, I'll have no choice but to buy another one. I suspect that some newer models may be even more enticing, but would have to look into that.",got unit lcd tv purchase huge humongous discount though heck give shot first step discouraging although setup easy device connects well via usb connection logitech smooth problem started adding component harmony auto setup step failed configure everything properly part due error small detail overlooked setting component fairly simple logitech database work however extremely important understand activity function work need configured core harmony brain fail quite disappointed like many negative review suggest make long story short couple day playing device love fully understand set tweak absolutely great av house single unit nine ten work great even older component including old dvd player another common brand somewhat old cable box actually cable box new upgrade hd dvr pleasantly surprised harmony recognized without problem yet experiment use remote give five star occasional goofy behavior certainly nothing bad worrisome annoying people gave one star review toy probably got frustrated right beginning failed understand follow instruction carefully given amazing number supported component old new find hard believe customer could make work properly suspect human error majority case set harmony properly start using see convenient even intuitive nice design thinking getting another one component control single room use time want use others room take harmony fortunately family member gotten hooked yet care choice buy another one suspect newer model may even enticing would look,"12 14, 2007",A3QZH73OQCUGI6,Doc Schreiber,,Very smart little thing,1197590400,False,4,1

The sound is not all that terrific but many users will do as I do and use outboard speakers.

For the price, it is hard to have too many nits or criticisms of this TV. It does what it is supposed to do. One minor nit is that when you insert a DVD the TV does not automatically switch to DVD mode, you have to do that manually. Not a big deal but other TVs that I have had that had built-in DVD players automatically switch when you insert a DVD.  Like all LED flatscreen TVs viewing angle matters and if you are watching TV on this unit you will want to be directly in front of it if possible.

I absolutely love this receiver, and it is a must have over the factory radio. The bluetooth connectivity is easy and lightning fast. The sound using Pandora, HD Radio, and Bluetooth streaming is CD quality. SiriusXM is, well, SiriusXM - very compressed and a tad bit muffled, but that is not the receiver's fault. The SiriusXM tuner is required if you decide to add that on. All of the above will generally display the album art, and that's pretty cool. DVD video and sound quality are fabulous.
My only knock on this radio is really not so much on the radio. It is with Pioneer and the AppRadio One app for Android that will not connect with the Samsung Galaxy S6. It is very well documented online that it will only work with iPhone and a handful of Android phones, and Pioneer has dropped the ball, particularly with a top-of-the-line smartphone like the S7. I would love to have the functionality that, quite honestly, I expected when I purchased the receiver.

I turned on the power and it worked.  If you are satisfied with the sound, that's it, you are done.  Incredibly easy.

You can interface it with your remote which also shocked me with how easy it was compared to others I have reviewed.  The last sound bar I reviewed, I was never able to get the on/off to work with my Comcast remote.  Thus you had to use the sound bar remote to turn the sound bar off and on and then you could adjust the volume with your Comcast remote.  This sound bar all the basic functions programmed seamlessly.

Bluetooth setup was just as easy and I was impressed with the sound out put.  The bass is adjustable and surprisingly robust since there is no external or separate base.  Clear voice does seem to enhance dialogue on TV shows.  You get good separation on the stereo selection which again is a surprise considering it is only 39"" long.  That is a serious selling feature for my spouse as she did not like the size of the 60"" sound bar I had previously reviewed.

The surround sound setting seems to provide the best audio experience but I haven't experienced any content that featured surround sound to truly test it.

The feet are detachable if you want to wall mount or have it lower in front of your TV.  The infrared pass through was another remarkably easy set up.  I didn't want to remove the feet as it appears one of the speakers feeds out the bottom and I was afraid that would muffle it.  The infrared pass through worked seamlessly too.

I am impressed with this sound bar.

The tabs that keep the iPad in place cover the actual screen corners.  The top right tab obstructs the controls (volume and mute buttons) on the side and the sleep button on top.  The cover started to bend within hours of putting my iPad in it.  The magnet clasp is really weak.  It doesn't turn the iPad on/off automatically when you open/close it.  The inside, while soft, attracts dust/pet hair/lint/other random particles like crazy.

When I went to the Apple store to buy a different case, I mentioned the above to the employee helping me and she stated that Apple doesn't carry Belkin iPad cases for exactly the reasons I listed above.  iPads cost a lot of money and should be protected with a good case.

As several other reviewers have writhed, the only sound output was a loud static clicking. However, after reading several reviews, I realized there was important information on the bottom of the product box relating to your TVs audio setting.

After switching the TV audio setting to PCM, I got the adaptor to work. I just wish the manufacturer, distributor, or whoever is sending these things, would be more aware of the frustration level and include an inserted flyer or card, that is a more instinctively examined notice in the actual box, than leaving it for late discovery on the bottom of the box.
Anyway, it seems fine so far, but the sound, now  pushed to a large set of R/L speakers isn't all that much to write home about. I wonder if the Dolby is what  I'm missing, and taken for granted.
I guess it's still better than the TV, but, without a real 2.1 and up system, you lose the mid range, and vocal quality.
So, that's why this adaptor costs $19., and a miminal new 2.1 system costs $200.

6433,669492,669492,B01EIQDGDO,,5.0,"I actually purchased this directly from the Apple store, but I love it.  I held off buying the 2015 version for a year because I was concerned about the size (12 inches almost seeming too small for a laptop), the new keyboard, a single port, and the capabilities of the Core M processor as opposed to an i5 that comes standard in the MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros.  So, this is a review written by someone who's owned, multiple PC's, a 2015 13"" MacBook Air, and a 2015 13"" MacBook Pro.

First of all, I'll address the keyboard.  I had tapped on it in the Apple store a few times and wasn't exactly impressed.  Coming from the phenomenal keyboards of the MacBook Air & Pro, it seemed to different.  However, after using it for the last few days, I have to say it feels amazing to type on.  While you don't get the travel that you do in a MacBook Air or Pro, you do get a satisfying *click* from each keystroke.

Second is the trackpad.  If you've used the 2015 MacBook Pro, you know that the Force Touch trackpads keep the incredible accuracy and satisfyingly smooth glass finish of older MacBooks, but with a much improved clicking mechanism that allows you to ""click"" anywhere on the trackpad easily.  The MacBook continues that awesome tradition.

Third is the screen.  Like the new MBP's, this computer has the Retina screen which is gorgeous to look at.  It's plenty bright, and the thin bezels really make it feel like the screen is larger than it is.

Fourth is the processors.  I'd heard that the 2015 Core M's were a little weak, but the 2016 model I purchased (256GB / Core M3 configuration) performs almost as good as my 2015 MBP with a Core i5 processor.  I've opened programs such as PhotoShop, iTunes, Word and others with little to no lag, and I'm able to open 10 tabs easily with active webpages.

Fifth is the battery life.  I'd been concerned about the 2015 models because they only had 9 hours of battery life, but the 2016 versions have bumped that up to a solid 10, and so far I've been able to achieve that number while web-surfing with about 70% screen brightness which is about perfect for indoor usage.

Sixth is the single port.  I expected this to be a turn off, but the truth is I've barely noticed it.  I did purchase a dongle which would allow me to plug a USB 3.0 into the computer, but in 2016 I rarely need to do anything like that with my ultraportable laptop like this one.  Most peripherals like printers, mice, iPhones, etc...can connect via blue-tooth or other wireless means, so Apple was actually kind of smart in setting it up this way.  Would an extra port be nice?  Sure.  But it wasn't a deal breaker for me.

Summary:  So, if it isn't clear by now, I love this laptop.  But, you need to know what it IS useful for and what it ISN'T useful for.  This, in my opinion, is a great secondary laptop.  I use it as a mobile platform to avoid lugging around my much heavier MacBook Pro.  It doesn't have multiple ports, it doesn't have a super-strong processor, and it isn't going to suit your needs if you're a power user.

But if all you're looking for is something to be ultra-mobile and perform almost as good as a regular laptop, then it is perfect.  I use it mostly in class to take notes on, surf the web, type papers, do a little light-editing of photos, listen to music, and things like that.

If that's what you're looking for, and you can afford the price, then I say it is very worth it.

I added another one to my personal arsenal - The newest addition gets bumped down a star - Still a good C Stand but there are some noticeable differences in quality (nothing major, but still enough to warrant an update) - The newest one is a tad heavier (by 3.5 lbs) which isn't a big deal to me, and may or may not matter to you either, but worth a mention none the less;
The gobo head does not tighten as securely around the extension arm as the first stand. It holds a firm grip but the gap is evident. I compared it with the first gobo and swapped arms, measured and it's obvious that the new gobo was machined a little off calibration wise. This stand didn't come 'assembled' either - also not a big deal but the first stand was prime eligible and arrived assembled in 2 days with free shipping - Which brings me to the last mediocre 'con' - No prime shipping, UPS Ground, pricey and SLOW - Size warrants a bulky box, and bulky box will probably arrive bruised and crushed since the C Stand only takes up 1/4 of the box, making the parcel vulnerable to being crushed from top (which isn't going to damage the stand but still an issue as far as shipping woes)
Still a good stand, just not as friendly on the budget after $30 shipping, lag time, no prime eligibility, etc, I probably should of just spent a few extra bucks and got a Kupo, Matthews, etc - 4 out of 5 stars - Shop around or spend the extra coin and get a name brand with prime.

Great high quality C Stand here! One of the many downsides of photography and film is that it is def not a poor man's hobby as most people quickly learn as they expand their equipment. This is more of a myth these days as lighting kits and equipment become cheaper in price and more accessible to the amateur. The common problem is the cheaper the price, the cheaper the quality.

Not the case here.

This C Stand is just as good as my Matthews, and 1/2 the price. The rubber grip is an added bonus too. Solidly built, it is holding up just fine. I was a bit leery of buying this at first, as I have had the usual woes with cheap plastic stands, but this is by no means a cheaply built product. Does the job great, folds easy for storage and it compliments my name brand in both durability and quality.

My only advice would be to shop around. The price fluctuates on these, and while I feel I got a great price, if I can save even more $$ I will. I plan on adding a few more to my arsenal, as they are invaluable on any shoot.",update march added another one personal arsenal newest addition get bumped star still good c stand noticeable difference quality nothing major still enough warrant update newest one tad heavier lb big deal may may matter either worth mention none le gobo head tighten securely around extension arm first stand hold firm grip gap evident compared first gobo swapped arm measured obvious new gobo machined little calibration wise stand come assembled either also big deal first stand prime eligible arrived assembled day free shipping brings last mediocre con prime shipping ups ground pricey slow size warrant bulky box bulky box probably arrive bruised crushed since c stand take box making parcel vulnerable crushed top going damage stand still issue far shipping woe still good stand friendly budget shipping lag time prime eligibility etc probably spent extra buck got kupo matthew etc star shop around spend extra coin get name brand prime great high quality c stand one many downside photography film def poor man hobby people quickly learn expand equipment myth day lighting kit equipment become cheaper price accessible amateur common problem cheaper price cheaper quality case c stand good matthew price rubber grip added bonus solidly built holding fine bit leery buying first usual woe cheap plastic stand mean cheaply built product job great fold easy storage compliment name brand durability quality advice would shop around price fluctuates feel got great price save even plan adding arsenal invaluable shoot,"05 4, 2013",A27ESL2WL53HJZ,finaldraft151,,Excellent Quality,1367625600,True,,1

7927,603048,603048,B011WSX82A,,5.0,"This is a very good radar detector with some nice features you just won't find many, if any, other places.

Range: The range on this unit can be very good, especially on Ka Band. It will meet or exceed the range of many high end detectors and have excellent off-axis sensitivity to pick up radar signals that may not be directly in front of you. One note, K band range has tested good but not excellent. It has been sufficient in my area but is not on the same level as the Ka range. If K is not a big concern in your area, not issues. If K is your primary threat, you may want to consider its bigger brother the SE or another unit all together. For me it is a non issue and leads to less false alerts.

Filtering: Multiple options for filtering. Speed based muting keeps everything under a certain speed limit very quiet. One alert and then it mutes. Additional speed based city and auto city modes will lower sensitivity to X, K, and Ka bands based on your preference at a pre set speed (such as your typically speed limit in your area). Another level under that mutes everything completely. Good for parking lots and such (think 15 mph and lower). In addition it has two levels of TSR filtering. Most radar detectors only have one. Low adds a short delay to K band alerts to be sure that it is not a traffic filter or blind spot monitor system found on some newer cars. High makes the delay longer to accomplish the same thing. Use whichever works for you. The lower the better as the shorter delay allows the detector to respond more quickly.

GPS: This detector also has GPS lockout features built in. I don't personally use them as the GPS speed sensitive alerts referenced above are sufficient for me and I don't have to worry about accidentally locking out a real threat. Radenso is working on a firmware update to change the way lockouts are handled. In addition to lockouts, this detector offers Speed Camera, Redlight Camera, and Speed Trap Camera GPS alerts and the database is free (included with cost of detector). This is very important if these can be found in your area.

Additional PROS: The size. This this is tiny. Should be able to find a place for this thing in any vehicle. Other detectors that don't have GPS are much larger. The mount works very well. They are constantly improving this unit through downloadable firmware updates as well as the Speedcam, Redlightcam, and Speed Trap Database. They say they are enthusiast driven and are working hard on continuous improvement. That is a plus.

CONS: If I had to point out a few things that could be better. I sometimes have trouble viewing the screen wearing Polarized Sunglasses. This can be mitigated some by changing the angle or moving the location on the windshield. The power connector is a type typically seen on cheaper detectors, could have used a style similar to Escort, Beltronics, and Uniden. The case does not feel as substantial as the price tag might indicate. Not necessarily a huge deal as long as you didn't buy it to hold or stare at and admire.",good radar detector nice feature find many place range range unit good especially ka band meet exceed range many high end detector excellent axis sensitivity pick radar signal may directly front one note k band range tested good excellent sufficient area level ka range k big concern area issue k primary threat may want consider bigger brother se another unit together non issue lead le false alert filtering multiple option filtering speed based muting keep everything certain speed limit quiet one alert mute additional speed based city auto city mode lower sensitivity x k ka band based preference pre set speed typically speed limit area another level mute everything completely good parking lot think mph lower addition two level tsr filtering radar detector one low add short delay k band alert sure traffic filter blind spot monitor system found newer car high make delay longer accomplish thing use whichever work lower better shorter delay allows detector respond quickly gps detector also gps lockout feature built personally use gps speed sensitive alert referenced sufficient worry accidentally locking real threat radenso working firmware update change way lockout handled addition lockout detector offer speed camera redlight camera speed trap camera gps alert database free included cost detector important found area additional pro size tiny able find place thing vehicle detector gps much larger mount work well constantly improving unit downloadable firmware update well speedcam redlightcam speed trap database say enthusiast driven working hard continuous improvement plus con point thing could better sometimes trouble viewing screen wearing polarized sunglass mitigated changing angle moving location windshield power connector type typically seen cheaper detector could used style similar escort beltronics uniden case feel substantial price tag might indicate necessarily huge deal long buy hold stare admire,"12 29, 2015",A1XOBCHAAHEVV4,Chris,,"A very good detector, competes with the top tier in certain categories, offers some features not found elsewhere",1451347200,False,4,1

5579,161856,161856,B002IPHA1W,,4.0,"I had gotten this for primarily gym usage.  Here's my thoughts after a few hours of use:

Pros:

1) GREAT sound...really brings out the clarity and deep bass in my MP3's. I usually use my HTC EVO 4G for music...I think I'll be switching over to the Sony now, as it sounds that good.

2) It IS actually Rhapsody compatible: I've transferred about 10 playlists with no issues

3) Folder support.  Wish this was standard in all music players for those of us who like
to organize music by actual folders

4) Dedicated toggle switch for headphone/speakers...nice!

5) Fairly decent stereo speakers.

Cons:

1) SLOW transfer rate.  Took an hour to transfer 5GB of DRM-free mp3's (without any file conversion).  I have a reasonably powerful computer: 2.8Ghz Athlon II Dual Core, 4GB RAM, Win 7 (64-bit), fast 500GB SATA hard disk.  Also latest firmware and transfer software.

2) Feels very light, cheap, and ""plasticy""...I think I'll be getting a case for this since I plan to use at the gym.  It has NO feeling of sturdiness to it...and NO clip or case of any kind included.

3) Comes with a separate cheap kickstand that can't be attached that you'll probably lose VERY quickly.  Not that you'd really want to watch video on this thing anyway vs. any decent cell phone these days.  My EVO 4G's screen blows it away, naturally.

4) It LOOKS like the external speakers are on the front...but they're not.  They're actually on the back of the unit, and when you set it down on a table the speakers are completely flush with the table so the speakers get severely muffled.  Very strange design choice, in my opinion.

5) No expandable storage...no micro-SD slot.  Although with 16GB of storage I guess I'll be ok.

6) Non-standard input for USB connectivity (Typical for SONY...this is SO annoying...now I'll need to buy a separate extra charger and cable since it only came with one USB cable and no charger)

7) Stops after reaching end of album/folder.  You can choose to repeat an album/folder but it can't proceed to next one after it finishes...kind of stupid when even my Sony MP3 stereo from 2004 can do that.

Overall, I recommend it if you don't need the latest and greatest iPod with a bunch of frills, and ONLY care about sound, battery life, and decent capacity...which is what I was looking for at just over $100 new.",gotten primarily gym usage thought hour use pro great sound really brings clarity deep bass mp usually use htc evo g music think switching sony sound good actually rhapsody compatible transferred playlist issue folder support wish standard music player u like organize music actual folder dedicated toggle switch headphone speaker nice fairly decent stereo speaker con slow transfer rate took hour transfer gb drm free mp without file conversion reasonably powerful computer ghz athlon ii dual core gb ram win bit fast gb sata hard disk also latest firmware transfer software feel light cheap plasticy think getting case since plan use gym feeling sturdiness clip case kind included come separate cheap kickstand attached probably lose quickly really want watch video thing anyway v decent cell phone day evo g screen blow away naturally look like external speaker front actually back unit set table speaker completely flush table speaker get severely muffled strange design choice opinion expandable storage micro sd slot although gb storage guess ok non standard input usb connectivity typical sony annoying need buy separate extra charger cable since came one usb cable charger stop reaching end album folder choose repeat album folder proceed next one finish kind stupid even sony mp stereo overall recommend need latest greatest ipod bunch frill care sound battery life decent capacity looking new,"12 29, 2010",A6BF189MUQ4M8,Raheen B,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},Pretty good no frills player for the price (Pros & Cons),1293580800,True,,1

The usefulness of the inverter are clear: it saves you from needing an adapter for each one of your electronic devices that you want to use in the car -- it's one stop shopping. Anything with a two or three-prong plug can plug into it.

The inverter is small enough that it can easily fit into a glove box (taking up about as much space as a GPS) or into your computer bag.

During use I didn't notice anything unusual about the operation. Despite the fan it runs pretty quietly.

My one complaint is that the chord that goes into the cigarette lighter is so short that the inverter cannot reach the back seat or rear of the car. That means passengers are dependent on the people in the front of the car to plug and unplug devices. I took off one star for that.

The drive just bounces around inside, but this is all solid state so should be ok. The only worry is the mechanical parts such as the USB plug that extends out and the plastic casing it sits in.

Price - good price point of 50cents/GB.

Capacity - Good at 64GB

Speed - I am getting average write speeds of around 7.5MB/s (sometimes spikes to 15MB/s as well!) which is decent. I just did an rsync of my linux files to here and 7.5MB/s is not that bad. I transferred 50GB of data to it in  . Files were a mixture of <100KB to over 100MB. Haven't tested with the video files which are 1.5GB on average yet.
So it is not really the fastest drive. Read speeds are much higher at around 15MB/s avg as expected.
This is also a USB 2.0 drive. With a USB 3.0 drive, speeds should be much faster.

Bundled software - thankfully this is a blank drive with nothing on it.

Other thoughts -
I bought the Transcend 64GB over the Patriot Rage 64GB because that is twice the cost of this, but that does offer double write speed as well. Still I am not too worried about this because it is very good for its price.

Also Due to the way storage is reported (2^10 vs 10^3 i.e. 1024 bytes making up a GB in engineering notation vs 1000 making up a GigaByte in SI notation), the drive formatted reported is 61GB. Rest assured, it is the same as advertised. The drive companies use powers of 10 whereas computers use powers of 2 causing this confusion.

4248,179053,179053,B0062D4IHA,,3.0,"I'm a little disappointed in this item. It's probably partly my fault because at $13.00 I wouldn't have normally been expecting much, but since it said it was marked down from the regular price of $25.00, I thought maybe it would be OK. I have two problems with it.

1. This has been mentioned before, but in portrait mode, This case doesn't really provide much support. In the first position, with the Fire standing nearly upright, it almost always collapses and just falls backward. At the middle position, it seems to work OK as long as you're not doing much with the touch screen. If all you're doing is reading and touching it lightly to flip pages, it might be alright, but when pressing in a way that I consider normal, like tapping on the screen to open an app, or swiping with your finger is likely to make it collapse. I haven't tried the third setting with the fire positioned at about 25 to 30 degrees might work OK, but I'm not likely to use it in that position very often.

It seems to work a little better in the horizontal position because the side edge is making more contact with the case than in the vertical position.

The most obvious problem I see is that the raised strips in the cover that are trying to support the device and the edge of the case the Fire fits in that catches the raised edges just don't have enough contact with each other to keep the device secure. Maybe if the raised portion was higher, or there was some kind of small lip for the edge of the device case to catch it would work better, but as it is, there isn't much there to keep it from slipping off and collapsing when you tap, or swipe your finger on the touch screen.
I think I can make this work okay by using a little velcro on the raised strips and the edge of the Fire's case, so I'll probably keep it and play with making it work.

2. The description I read said that this is a leather case. I may be wrong, but I've been using leather accessories for a long time and if this is leather, it's not a leather from any animal I'm familiar with. It smells like something that is definitely man made and is actually fairly thin. I know, at $13.00 I'm being a little nit picky, but if the description says leather I expect it to smell like leather and not plastic.

On the plus side, it does have an elastic strap you can pull over the cover that keeps it closed securely.

I purchased this because there is only one other case I've seen that allows you to use the Fire in either the vertical, or horizontal position and I use both my phone and the Fire in each position a fairly equal amount of time, depending on what I'm using it for at the time.

Perhaps we'll have a better choice in cases once the Fire has been out for a while. As many Fire's as Amazon is selling, I would expect to see a lot more cases coming out and I'd recommend waiting for something that's designed and made a little better with better material. You might also look at cases for the 7"" Samsung Galaxy Tab, or the Blackberry Rim since they're the same size.

I'm giving this 3 stars, mainly because I do like the snap that allows me to swivel the Fire from horizontal to vertical, but the quality isn't that great and I'm going to have to make some modifications to make it work without collapsing when using the touch screen.",little disappointed item probably partly fault normally expecting much since said marked regular price thought maybe would ok two problem mentioned portrait mode case really provide much support first position fire standing nearly upright almost always collapse fall backward middle position seems work ok long much touch screen reading touching lightly flip page might alright pressing way consider normal like tapping screen open app swiping finger likely make collapse tried third setting fire positioned degree might work ok likely use position often seems work little better horizontal position side edge making contact case vertical position obvious problem see raised strip cover trying support device edge case fire fit catch raised edge enough contact keep device secure maybe raised portion higher kind small lip edge device case catch would work better much keep slipping collapsing tap swipe finger touch screen think make work okay using little velcro raised strip edge fire case probably keep play making work description read said leather case may wrong using leather accessory long time leather leather animal familiar smell like something definitely man made actually fairly thin know little nit picky description say leather expect smell like leather plastic plus side elastic strap pull cover keep closed securely purchased one case seen allows use fire either vertical horizontal position use phone fire position fairly equal amount time depending using time perhaps better choice case fire many fire amazon selling would expect see lot case coming recommend waiting something designed made little better better material might also look case samsung galaxy tab blackberry rim since size giving star mainly like snap allows swivel fire horizontal vertical quality great going make modification make work without collapsing using touch screen,"11 19, 2011",A2E6R5K2VZ0N5Q,Amazon Customer,,Not As Good As I Expected,1321660800,True,165,0

Here ""hot"" means the bass and treble notes sound emphacised compared to other phones, especially the Ipod's. Not bad mind you, just more in your face type of sound. I use them with the Shuffle, which you may know has the best bass response of all the Ipods (ref PCMag tests also check their new issue where they rate the 71's higher than Shure E3c)so the bass was really,Really right there. It may be a bit too bright on the low and high end, but it also eliminates the need for equalization for me. Other phones will sound dull after this, not necessarily more accurate, but definitively more dull. Ipod lounge is another good source for many ""bud"" and other phones comparisons as well. The specs for 51's and 71's are identical, as is the sound, the mounts on the 81's are a bit different but the sound is similar, people hate the two piece cord on the 71's. The wire lengths on the 51's are preferred by a vast majority, left ear is about 4"", right 12"", the joint cord about 4ft. The cord is tangle prone, and the little ""wrap"" case is useless, use an Altoids can instead. All of the 3 sizes of the ear pads fit in my ear OK, the inserts are THAT soft. The buds are small enough that you can fall asleep on the side of your head, and they will not hurt. They are not very efficient at 100db, the Ipod players are very loud at 1/2 full, but for instance my Panasonic MP3 CD player had to be turned almost all the way up.

I already love it in comparison to the other small speaker systems that I've take on trips in the past.

The issue is the plastic tab that you use to pull the speaker cable out from the body with... it's super flimsy and the tab already shows stress marks after my first time opening it.  It's basically a piece of plastic as thin as paper and as small as match head that you have to grasp with your finger nails and pull on any time you open it, and it's part of the normal molding so don't think that it's going to be especially durable plastic.  The same two plastic tabs get stuck on the carrying case liner when you put it in and out of it's protective case.

But I can say that they are lightyears ahead of anything you can find for less than $50.  The treble is clear and precise without sounding harsh. The bass is present, not thumpy. I absolutely hate bass-boosted headphones that sacrifice sound quality and balance for harder thumps. These offer a balanced sound, meaning the bass is there without taking away from the rest of the sound spectrum. If you want earth shattering, look elsewhere. The most impressive thing about these IEMs for me is the clarity of the sound. I feel like I'm hearing the music the way the artist intended it to be heard. I've thrown alternative, classic rock, metal, jazz, and some indie/folk at these and they handled all of them well, but I must say that the sound truly shines on softer acoustic type tracks.

It turns out I was expecting too much for a small tube shaped camera.  The other cameras I have are the Ion Air Pro Lite, Sena Prism Tube and some other no-name tube cam not worth naming.  This cam by far has the most features.  Ion may have tried to cram too many features into this cam.  Not all the non essential features will work well, but I don't use them all anyway.  The ones I do use seem to work well.  This review will basically be a comparison with the Sena Prism Tube.  .

What the Air Pro 3 HAS, where the Prism Tube does not: Very wide viewing angle. Once accustomed to having this extra wide angle available, it's hard to live with a narrower angle.  You can select different recording resolutions, although I leave mine at 1080 / 30fps all the time. It takes still photos, actually pretty nice ones at 12 megapixels.  The Prism Tube does not take still shots.  It has a built-in mic, but also has a standard mic jack for an external mic.  So, you don't need a proprietary mic.  The Prism Tube has no built-in mic, and requires a proprietary mic.  It has image stabilization. I questioned if the stabilization was actually working for a while, but when comparing with the Prism Tube which does not have stabilization, I can tell it's working.  Video is also not distorted during vibration and movement.  The Prism Tube's image sometimes seems jagged or distorted.  It is water proof, not just water resistant.  You can take it underwater up to 3 meters as long as the rear cover is attached.  Color is pretty accurate in all lighting conditions.  With the Prism tube, bright lighting often can throws off color balance.

What this does NOT have that the Prism Tube does have:  It's at least 30% larger in diameter than the Prism Tube.  I wish they would have made this cam a little smaller instead of trying to pack too many features into it.  I don't need WiFi, social media sharing, etc.  It doesn't have a side mount for your helmet.  I had to make my own.  Underwater videos and images are blurry.  In all fairness, the Prism Tube can't even go underwater.  Sound quality, even with a good external mic is poor.  It doesn't seem to pick up low tones at all.

 We are planning another roadtrip and it was very easy to transfer all of the places and routes that we want to ride from the laptop (from Mapquest.com) to the GPS. I think that is a fantastic feature!
 One other con, is that there is quite a bit of glare off the screen on a sunny day, even in the car making it a little frustrating to follow directions.
 I do not look forward to up-dating the unit as it takes hours and slows down everything in the house that used the internet, but it is free, so I tolerate it.

I'll save you some research time and tell you this is one of the few subs that doesn't make you hook up a wire directly from the battery. It's fairly easy to install yourself if you have the motivation. You use the included wiring harness, run the wires from the back to the front (using the car's wiring channels). Then use the FAST 9999 to splice into the wiring harness behind the stereo unit. Piece of cake, 6 color coded wires and you're good to go. No amp necessary either, this has a built in amp, and  the red power wire drives the sub with no problem. The wiring also has RCA connectors if you can't use the high level connectors. Remember though, it's either/or, DO NOT PLUG IN BOTH CONNECTOR TYPES AT THE SAME TIME. I'm not sure why but they make it sound like crossing the streams in Ghostbusters. Just don't try it.

If you're really into sound and music I'm sure you'll want something more expensive, but for the rest of us who need a little bass to fill out the sound in our car, this is more than enough to get the job done. Theres exactly zero bells and whistles here, just an input and a volume knob. No other physical adjustments, but it gets the job done.

704,648824,648824,B01ANMP6G2,,4.0,"First of all, I purchased this laptop from the Microsoft store instead of Amazon which comes with no bloat ware and is optimized for Windows (whatever that means).  I was really excited to unbox the laptop and begin using it immediately as this is the lightest and thinnest laptop that I've ever owned and it supposedly gets 10+ hours of battery life.  And as many other reviews have stated, you get a lot of bang for the buck.  At the moment no other laptop gives you a 256gb ssd and 8gb of ram for $699.  The only other feature I wished it has is a backlit keyboard.  I primarily use the laptop for surfing the web, light word processing, and some spreadsheet work and when working on the bed with the lights off, a backlit keyboard is a must.

I didn't run any benchmarks, but all of the work I've done on it so far has gone smoothly.  One thing I did check is the battery life.  I got about 7.5 hours of use off my first charge which I'm happy with since I travel quite a bit and can usually recharge before the battery runs out.  I couldn't say the same for my previous laptop which needed charging after 3 hours so this is a major improvement.

Almost everything about the laptop was perfect....the touchpad however drove me crazy.  For some reason I felt the right click made more noise than it should and just pressing it didn't feel like it clicked properly.  It felt like the touchpad was loose and made a clattering noise every time I pressed it.  I went back to the store and checked out the demo unit and the touchpad on the demo unit was firm and tight fitting.  Then I googled the problem and it seems like others were having the issue too.  I exchanged the laptop for another one and it had the same problem.  I then exchanged it one more time and the 3rd laptop still had the problem!  I was really bummed and was about to return it for a full refund.  I really wanted to keep the computer, but every time I clicked the touchpad it just bothered me.

I searched for a fix and came across a website that showed how to disassemble the laptop.  I was fairly hopeful that if I opened it up, I could easily fix the issue with some electrical tape which would tighten the gap that was making the touchpad behave the way it did.  Well I gently opened the back cover and examined the touchpad area.  I lightly tapped around and noticed that if I pressed against the bottom plate of the touchpad, the touchpad felt much better.  So I added a couple strips of electrical tape and sealed everything back up.  It was enough tape for the bottom cover to firmly press against the touchpad and now it is 99% better.

I would have easily given this laptop 5 stars, but because of this touchpad issue I'm only giving it 4.  If I could not have remedied that problem, I probably would have just returned the laptop and give it a 2 star rating.  I wouldn't recommend this fix for everyone since I probably voided my warranty.  But now that the touchpad doesn't clatter, I feel like its worth it.",first purchased laptop microsoft store instead amazon come bloat ware optimized window whatever mean really excited unbox laptop begin using immediately lightest thinnest laptop ever owned supposedly get hour battery life many review stated get lot bang buck moment laptop give gb ssd gb ram feature wished backlit keyboard primarily use laptop surfing web light word processing spreadsheet work working bed light backlit keyboard must run benchmark work done far gone smoothly one thing check battery life got hour use first charge happy since travel quite bit usually recharge battery run say previous laptop needed charging hour major improvement almost everything laptop perfect touchpad however drove crazy reason felt right click made noise pressing feel like clicked properly felt like touchpad loose made clattering noise every time pressed went back store checked demo unit touchpad demo unit firm tight fitting googled problem seems like others issue exchanged laptop another one problem exchanged one time rd laptop still problem really bummed return full refund really wanted keep computer every time clicked touchpad bothered searched fix came across website showed disassemble laptop fairly hopeful opened could easily fix issue electrical tape would tighten gap making touchpad behave way well gently opened back cover examined touchpad area lightly tapped around noticed pressed bottom plate touchpad touchpad felt much better added couple strip electrical tape sealed everything back enough tape bottom cover firmly press touchpad better would easily given laptop star touchpad issue giving could remedied problem probably would returned laptop give star rating recommend fix everyone since probably voided warranty touchpad clatter feel like worth,"04 29, 2015",APZSYRDSGZ8QX,Hilly,{'Style:': ' Prev Gen CPU/Win8/Grey'},Simple fix makes this a wonderful laptop,1430265600,False,12,1

Using my custom fan curve for benchmarking and keeping clocks at stock speeds this card does slightly better (2841) in Unigine Heaven 4.0 than the FE (2771).

With no fan curve it gets to around 75 deg C on load but remains rather quiet, and overall the noise is very similar to my EVGA ACX 2.0 I had on my GTX 970.

Lastly is price: for $611 this simply can't be beat. The options that come with this card (including stock OC and subjectively gimmicky RGB lighting) are too good to pass up. I can't recommend this card enough, it faces tough competition but I'm happy I went with this one.",got card today owning founder edition card safely say card one best first much quieter fe expected fe already quietest reference card market tolerable compared old reference card fan turn unless gaming even quiet using custom fan curve benchmarking keeping clock stock speed card slightly better unigine heaven fe fan curve get around deg c load remains rather quiet overall noise similar evga acx gtx lastly price simply beat option come card including stock oc subjectively gimmicky rgb lighting good pas recommend card enough face tough competition happy went one,"06 4, 2016",A39NW9PYZ13JLI,matthew l.,{'Style:': ' GTX 1080 G1 Gaming'},"Quiet, perfect stock overclock, and runs coooool.",1464998400,False,25.0,1

Can be single or double port adapter, doesn't matter).  The power adapter doesn't come with the hub for some reason, nor is it even shown in the (worthless) documentation.

But the way to hook up the hub is pretty simple once you realize it's missing the wall plug adapter.

4279,178266,178266,B005ZNHOW4,,3.0,"I first will start off by stating that I have a lot of respect for the Klipsch brand and have previously owned a set of home tower speakers and a powered subwoofer.  The subwoofer is still going strong at 17 years.  The towers, I sold a long time ago, but had great service; I blew the horn tweeters and Klipsch sent me a new pair within a week.

I had been wanting some new earbuds that were going to sound much better than the standard cheaper earbuds that most of us use.  I've had a couple of $10 Sony earbuds, a Philips, and probaby a bunch more.  If you go to Best Buy and sample all of the over-the-ear phones they have as samples: in my opinion, the Klipsch pair sound the best overall.  I can't stand Beats as they are way too bass heavy and they sucker people into buying their expensive products because of artist endorsement.  So I used some points to buy the reference S4's and ended up only actually paying about $15 for them.

Sound Quality:  I'm only going to rate these as being better than those priced say below $75-80 or less.  There might be some comparably priced Shure's or Seinheisser's that might sound just as good or better.  Since these are single driver earphones (like most are), they are only going to do so much.

Comfort/Fit:  I've never liked isolating rubber tips and this continues.  I have always simply preferred the basic cans that just sit in the ear.  Using these rubber tips never really feel like they are secure in my ears, and most of the ones that come with these are the same and fall out of my ears.  I have since ditched all the tips that came with the S4's and am using some custom DIY tips I made out of foam plugs that mold to your ear canals after you squeeze them.  This was the best idea; the plugs only cost $2 from Lowe's for 4 pair and are (1) comfortable, (2) near complete noise isolation, (3) and fit perfectly and don't fall out.

Uses:  I've used them occassionally on my DJ mixer and at work.  The real test is when I'm jogging and riding my bike.  using the OEM tips sucked ass, and they would fall out of my ears constantly...even using the sport mode of wrapping the wires around the ears.  Not a problem anymore with my DIY tips.

Overall:  If I had to do it again, I might consider similarly priced Shure's or Seinhesser's.  I've been doing a lot of research lately, and in the near future plan to buy some serious custom molded earplugs from Westone, the ES3's, that have a triple driver and triple crossover.  They are extremely pricey and not for everyone, but will serve me well for my needs when it comes to my deejaying.  If you are willing to spend a $100 on earphones, then I would consider to at least go ahead and spend a bit more and pick up some custom molded earphones with a single or double driver.  These will ultimately fit your ears perfectly, get better sound quality with a multi-driver, and get more noise isolation.

However it won't work out of the box for Mac Time Machine. No problem and no kidding, once I decided this was what I wanted to do it took me all of four minutes to set up for the fix. This required a re-partition to put in a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partition. This process took 3.9 of those 4 minutes. I went to Launchpad, then Other, then Disk Utilities, then clicked on the 480.1 GB OTG Media icon in the disk utilities app, then went through the steps of: setting up the partition, then clicking to start the partition. I'd suppose that some of the remaining 6 seconds were taken up refreshing the display on the Disk Utilities program. This thing is fast. I was expecting 20 minute but it was done before I could change songs on my iTunes. So it may have been five or two seconds in truth.

I left a small NTFS partition on the disk in case I needed to drop and drag a file using either a Windows computer or my Apple running NTFS for Mac,a program which Amazon sells but won't allow reviewers to directly link from this screen.

Using it for Time Machine it just runs without any noticeable decrease of system performance.

One caveat should be that the partitioning should be before adding any vital data files to the drive, since the Mac Disk Utility erases all the files before it partitions.

-The power chord has an odd connector that just ""feels"" loos or odd when connecting it. Maybe just a nerve system programming issue??

-The internal keyboard is very iffy. It just misses a lot of letters when I type them.

-The computer has a fan that sporadically decides to make a rattling noise. I just don't have the patience to send it in for repair.

-The HD video system is outdated and apparently Toshiba is doing nothing for us in spite of this. This one is almost frustrating enough to bring it down to three stars.

The positive aspects ar many, including:

-Super fast video. The dual video SLI with 512 MB of video memory runs even modern games with beautiful graphics.

-Dual hard drives. Great for running the virtual machines I run for the technical training classes I teach. If you don't know what virtual machines are, don't worry. This feature just gives you better drive performance.

-The screen is beautiful. I'm not referencing the graphics card here, but the actual screen display.

-For a laptop, the sound is the best I've had yet. I can watch a movie on it in my hotel room from across the room and the sound is clear and even has some bass to it with the subwoofer.

It is very inexpensive but do not equate its low price point with substandard quality...the quality of this mount is excellent!  It is a really well engineered mount, with sliding and tilting arms which attach to the TV and horizontal support brackets that fasten to the wall.  The steel it is comprised of feels very strong and I had no worries that this mount would be able to properly support the 42"" Panasonic LED TV I was hanging above my fireplace.  All the mounting hardware is included (as is a 10 foot HDMI cable and a bubble level).  This is the second TV I have wall mounted, the first being over ten years ago when the process was a lot more difficult and when TV's were a lot heavier.  This was a much easier mounting process that required only minimal mechanical skill and tools, although I would still suggest having a partner.
This is also a VESA mount.  VESA is an organization that provides uniformity standards for the different brands of consumer electronics to comply with, which as far as mounts go, means that most major TV brands will have similar mounting set-ups so the process and equipment used for mounting will be standard, or 'VESA compliant'.  This mount will most likely be an excellent choice for 99% of wall mounting applications.

However, it does not move well on carpet due to the small diameter wheels. Note: the carpet I have is not very thick. It feels like it is under a lot of strain when I do move it, and the center hub likes to collapse and come apart, hence the reason the other stand snapped an arm.
Why three stars? Because it still functionally works in keeping my case off the carpet, somewhat mobile, and adequate airflow at the case bottom.

With 2 microdrives I can achieve that quaintly with no computer necessary! And the cost of a single drive is recouped in 3 sessions (Film and processing costs eliminated).
Cons: Horrible low light sensitivity...Slow saving in the HiRes modes and the camera controls TOTALLY lock up while the cache is written to the disk/drive (after 3 consecutive shots in HiRes ONLY). You can shoot, but not change ANYTHING manually. This problem disappears in the JPEG modes which are fine for many applications. Autofocus is slow at extreme telephoto setting and in low light. AND the shutter release button delay is intolerable when using flash or in low light.

I also purchased a Verbatim folding keyboard and a folding stand, so I carry this home instead of my laptop many nights. Want to read outside? Wear a dark shirt or get a matte screen protector, but it's going to be reflective due to its shiny face. I can cope, though.

I wanted to get a couple of extra cables and got fast response from their support folks in California. That was a very nice thing when dealing with a brand I had never heard of. If they keep up the level of service that I got, they'll capture a large share of the market quickly.

Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Do my friends like it? Yes, all of them (a bit of jealousy, too). Any buyer's remorse? Nope. Should you get one? That's up to you, but I'm quite happy with mine.

1867,531328,531328,B00PPXMM5S,,4.0,"There are so, so many of these dash cams out there, and they're becoming more popular in the US, so I figured I should get ahead of the game and try one out in my car.

The device comes well-boxed with a car charger (cigarette lighter with a long, long cable (about 4 feet) to micro USB), a regular micro USB cable for your computer, a suction cup, and that's about it. It's a very through-the-motions packaging experience. Nothing fancy, and the camera itself is a little plastic-y. The buttons on the camera have a very satisfying click to them, and my sample's regular LCD screen looked just fine (if not HD), with no stuck/dead pixels or other screen anomalies.

Setup was a little trickier than I'd have liked, - it's not a touch screen, and the button layout is not instinctively intuitive. Once you have it set up (date/time etc), it all becomes a lot simpler as you'll likely just be hitting the record button.

Getting a micro SD card into the unit took a bit of finagling. I ended up using a credit card to push it in all the way as I don't really have any nails to speak of. In a positive sense, at least it won't be popping out by mistake!

Image quality is actually quite decent. There's a slight fish-bowl look to things, a result of the extremely wide lens in there to capture everything very close in front of you (in the event of a collision, for example). Cars come out pretty well defined, and you'd have no trouble reading license plates when the car in front is reasonably close to you. This is important, so I'm glad it works.

Curiously, while you can zoom in and out, you cannot do this while the camera is recording. However, to be fair, it's just a digital zoom (there's no physical lens movement that I can tell), so you don't gain any extra detail by zooming in anyway. If you have some basic editing tools at home, you can always zoom in as necessary, after the fact.

The GSHOCK option in the camera menu I found quite interesting. You can set it to low, medium, or high sensitivity, and the camera will record if it detects any sudden shock to the device. This could be particularly handy if someone crashes into you when you're parked, although if they ram the back of your car, you might well be wishing you had another camera in the back window! At the highest sensitivity (my recommendation), it did a pretty decent job when I tapped the camera mount itself - starting recording immediately, though I'll wait till someone reverses into my car to test that feature out extensively!

There are a few software quirks (e.g. to turn the device off you have to hold down the power button for a second or two... and then let go. If you don't let go, it never actually turns off! Weird), and the interface definitely takes a little getting used to, but, you know.., the Esky 2.4"" Full HD car camera does a pretty decent job - doing basically what it sets out to do, and it works.

Overall, 4 out of 5. Certainly recommended for those in need of a dash-cam fix!

First off, if you expecting an OEM battery you can spend 6x what this one costs to get those standards. I call these my back up batteries that I use first while on a shoot or out in the field.

I have 2 Canon OEM batteries which can be recharged for years, have no problem communicating, and are my reliable sources of power. Along with those 2 OEM Batteries I have 4 of these inexpensive batteries that do the job when my shooting is a little more flexible. They probably hold about 80% of the charge an OEM battery has and after a 12-18 months I expect my camera may stops communicating all together or it will no longer hold a charge. That's the nature of the game.

However, if you go into this purchase knowing that then you shouldn't be surprised if one dies on you.

9927,175506,175506,B0039NM5SK,,2.0,"I have used other powerline adapters (primarily Netgear). The only advantage the PLA-407 has is the noise-filtering front outlet but this is outweighed by the awful software & difficult encryption setup.
THE GOOD:
+ Noise filtering front outlet allows you to plug in extension cords or other devices without affecting the PLA network speed due to noisy devices. Note that the PLA-407 is a 200Mbps powerline device (there are faster 500Mbps devices but these are typically more expensive)
+ Adapter supports manually-set priority levels PER ADAPTER. You can designate an adapter to have higher priority than another one set to ""Normal"" for example. Note this is not ""true"" Quality of Service based on analysis of transmitted data etc but a simple priority scheme to allow certain adapters to have better/worse priority than others.
THE BAD:
The Zyxel PLA config utility v4.1.2 software is truly awful:
- The configuration screen is not intuitive or friendly. The config utility seems like a prototype and not a production/end-user tool.
- The utility does not show the existing network name (NMK) so you cannot tell if all adapters are setup correctly with the same name. (What Zyxel calls the network name other manufacturers refer to as the powerline password). This may be for security reasons, so you better keep track of your network name otherwise if you want to add a device later and don't remember the name you'll have to reconfig the name on all PLA devices.
- Related to the above point, since you CANNOT tell what the network name is you can't tell whether the PLA is using the default (i.e. unsecure) name or a custom name. This means you will have to keep notes, especially if setting up multiple adapters.
- The firmware update function is handled by a separate utility which must be downloaded. The firmware utility says ""Your device is doing with new firmware"" when updating (no, that's not my typo).
- The default ""green power-down"" feature can confuse you when using the PC config utility if you don't realise that a PLA adapter that does not have an ethernet connection to a powered-up device will go to ""sleep"" after 60 seconds and will NOT show up or respond in the PC config utility. The default timeout should be longer than 60 seconds to accommodate setup. (As an aside there seems to be no way to extend or disable the low power mode from the PC config utility). I'm all for saving power but this makes simultaneous configuration difficult (i.e. multiple adapters at the same time) as they will all need to be connected to a POWERED-UP device with an ethernet port) to prevent them from going to sleep!
- At 1st glance there appears to be no way to figure out what firmware version each PLA is using from the config utility. Hidden in the ""about"" icon (next to the question mark) it shows the utility version and ""firmware version"" but I have no idea which adapter has this firmware (i.e. it is showing a firmware version but not indicating which adapter has this version - remember the utility can show multiple adapters)
- The firmware utility doesn't show the existing version before upgrading.
- The encryption method using the button procedure indicated in the user guide PDF did not work for me - as another reviewer noted the LEDs don't flash as the manual indicates. I believe the manual is incorrect.

OVERALL I don't recommend this PLA adapter if you care about configuring/implementing security because of the PC config software - shame on you Zyxel for having the worst software that I've ever seen on a powerline adapter (Zyxel: get the guys who did the excellent interface on the NSA320 NAS to fix your PLA software!)
If you don't care about security and plug it in ""out of the box"" (with no security) then this may work for you. But there are cheaper PLA solutions (especially if you don't need the front noise-filtering outlet) such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TP-Link-Powerline-Adapter-TL-PA211-STARTER-KIT/dp/B0055XKBW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TP-Link Powerline Adapter (TL-PA211 STARTER KIT)</a>.

This problem is with the app because  the pen works perfectly in the Bamboo Apps. In all apps palm rejection works but only if the pen touches the screen first. This may be adjustable in settings but I have only had the pen for a few hours so can't be certain. If not Targus has a cheap cleaning pad you can wear on your hand while you write. The plus to that solution is that it both cleans and keeps your screen clean while you write. I also plan to get MetiMoji Note Pro which has a palm rejection pane. An option some users may want to consider. Also the pen stays connected through Bluetooth well but if you accidentally hit the button on the side you will have to go into Bluetooth options click forget device and then pair the device again. Also within Bamboo Paper from the Windows Store you get all the available tools packs free. The app is also free. I am not sure if pressure sensitivity works I have not checked the Settings because typically I prefer it not to. Offset from the pen tip is barely noticeable and only when you hold the pen at an extreme angle. Works marvelously with handwriting recognition in the handwriting board that is an alternative to the on screen keyboard.  I gave four stars instead of five bc I think it needs a little tweaking and should not just be marketed for iPad especially since apparently it works better with other devices. Get this pen you will be glad you did! Also there are other drawing apps I have not tried that have active stylus support that I plan on trying.

Update:
Pressure sensitivity seems to work in Sketchable fairly well as well as in Bamboo Paper. Palm rejection works as long as the pen touches first for both of these apps. The more I use the pen in other apps the more the wavy line issue seems to go away. I also am probably adapting to the pen but I think it is adapting also. Diagonals were the worst like an X but they are clearing up. Palm rejection seems to be improving as well. One problem is that once the pen gets low on power it's less reliable like when writing the lower case e some how it comes out a c and has to be erased and rewritten.
Someone asked about if this pen works well for drawing I bought the Sketchable app pack and tried it out, when I tried to answer their question thoroughly something went wrong and I couldn't so I am posting here in the update section. The pen seems to work well enough for drawing. A tip though is that if you often lean your drawing utensils at extreme angles like I do pay attention to the cursor and go by it for drawing BC there will often be an offset but even it seems to improve with use.",active stylus work really well nokia lumia wavy line problem apps problem app pen work perfectly bamboo apps apps palm rejection work pen touch screen first may adjustable setting pen hour certain targus cheap cleaning pad wear hand write plus solution clean keep screen clean write also plan get metimoji note pro palm rejection pane option user may want consider also pen stay connected bluetooth well accidentally hit button side go bluetooth option click forget device pair device also within bamboo paper window store get available tool pack free app also free sure pressure sensitivity work checked setting typically prefer offset pen tip barely noticeable hold pen extreme angle work marvelously handwriting recognition handwriting board alternative screen keyboard gave four star instead five bc think need little tweaking marketed ipad especially since apparently work better device get pen glad also drawing apps tried active stylus support plan trying update pressure sensitivity seems work sketchable fairly well well bamboo paper palm rejection work long pen touch first apps use pen apps wavy line issue seems go away also probably adapting pen think adapting also diagonal worst like x clearing palm rejection seems improving well one problem pen get low power le reliable like writing lower case e come c erased rewritten someone asked pen work well drawing bought sketchable app pack tried tried answer question thoroughly something went wrong posting update section pen seems work well enough drawing tip though often lean drawing utensil extreme angle like pay attention cursor go drawing bc often offset even seems improve use,"12 26, 2014",A335BHX8MKRXWL,Eric Harris,{'Color:': ' Gray'},Works well with Nokia Lumina 2520,1419552000,True,,1

I set up my Wireless Access Point and a Slingbox for example. Well, I knew something was up (prolly with the router settings) so I called Linksys Tech Support and it got routed to The Philippines. The lady asked me if I wanted to pay $9.99 and she would go into my computer and set it up herself using WebEx. I said, ""Sure - why not??"" I was already intrigued by this... even though I didn't think I should have to pay, but it's guaranteed or else you will not be charged.

After I paid, I spent about an hour with her and was able to see everything she was doing, which was manually. She also installed my camera software and set that up as well.  Of course, I had to be her assistant and plug the camera in and out and such. She did a pretty good job and I was able to ask her questions in regards to setting it up on the web. I would never have figured any of that out in that little time.

I'm happy with the purchase for what I use it for (The Kitty Poo Cam!). It's placed directly above my cat box so when I go out of town and if it needs help when it malfunctions, I'm able to call my neighbor to come help!

The quality isn't so great, but it's still doable. Plus, before, I had a $30 Logitech Webcam with an additional $15 USB extender and a crazy wire going through my condo that would not be reliable as well, so paying the extra $55 is well worth it!

Before this I've been using my Canon Powershot Camera but the video quality is horrible and the file is too big. I also was eyeing the Flip Video but it was too expensive so I chose this one.

I love the video quality! In lighted condition, the quality is excellent. I can record my children's milestones and shenanigans and share it with family through youtube. In low light the picture is grainy but that's the case whatever camcorder you use anyway. I have a Canon DV camcorder and it takes grainy videos in low light as well.

Ease of use is excellent. I can shoot a video and go to my computer right away and upload it to youtube. The battery life is great!  I haven't tested the waterproof claim and I don't plan on it. I don't need to shoot underwater. :)

The zoom on the video camera is better than my Canon POwershot. I used this on the beach and was able to shoot my husband body surfing from far away. This is good for school performances which I've already had. My 3 year old twins had a school spring presentation and caught it nicely from from the back row (I think I was more than 50 feet away from the stage).

The picture quality is good outdoors. But other than that, I don't like it and don't use it for this purpose. The only time I use it is if I was video taping and thought what was happening would be great in picture. I go ahead and do that while filming. That's a nice feature.

The photos were taken with a Nikon D5000, tripod mounted, no digital sharpening, of fixed targets on my living room wall at about six feet.  The targets consisted of newspaper at the corners and a large US map in the center, with a variety of detail and some color. Illumination was provided by house lamps and a photo flood light. The photos were compared side by side at 200% enlargement.

The Sigma 10-20 was not as sharp as the Nikon 16-85 in the very center of the image at comparable focal lengths (16mm  and 20mm) and apertures, although was very close by f/5 and nearly the same at f/8.  At the edges of the image however, the Sigma 10-20 was as sharp or sharper and had better contrast at all f-stops tested (3.5-8).  I have no lens to compare the Sigma 10-20 to at shorter focal lengths but Imaging Resource tests indicate good to very good sharpness, similar to the older Sigma 10-20.

Focus speed with the Sigma 10-20 is very fast and quiet, similar to the Nikon 16-85. There is some variation in auto focus reproducibility but seems to be within a reasonable margin of error and will likely not be noticable in most photographs. The zoom action of the Sigma is smoother than the Nikon.  The lens is somewhat larger and heavier than the Nikon.

Chromatic aberration/color fringing has been reported as being an issue with many wide angle lenses, including this lens. I will comment on this after shooting some high contrast scenes outdoors if I feel it is significant.

This is my second copy of the lens.  The first copy appeared to have a slight back focus problem at 10mm at short focal distances as indicated by variations in auto focus performance vs manual focus to achieve optimal sharpness. Optically, the first copy appeared as sharp as this one and likely would have been acceptable to most users.

First edit 9-30-09: Outdoor shots posted in the gallery. The lens performed well in the field yielding good color and contrast. Flaring is visible as the lens is tilted towards the sun. I used my baseball cap to shade the lens and would also recommend the lens hood in most situations.  At 10mm, sharpness is acceptable at f3.5 in the center and quite soft at the edges. Sharpness at the edges seems fairly good by f4.5. Color fringing is quite evident in high contrast areas near the edges of the image however it was not so bright as to apppear in uncorrected 8x10 prints. Also it was quite easy to reduce the fringing to a non-issue with CA correction using Adobe CS4. Auto focus was accurate. Overall I'm quite pleased with this lens and I'd say it outperforms my expectations for sharpness and vignetting but I wish the CA was better controlled. I will keep this lens, however the older version (f4-5.6) is reported to be as good or perhaps better in some respects so I'd recommend the f3.5 lens only if the constant aperature is of interest to you.",compared performance test image taken sigma f nikon vrii consider sharpest lens photo taken nikon tripod mounted digital sharpening fixed target living room wall six foot target consisted newspaper corner large u map center variety detail color illumination provided house lamp photo flood light photo compared side side enlargement sigma sharp nikon center image comparable focal length mm mm aperture although close f nearly f edge image however sigma sharp sharper better contrast f stop tested lens compare sigma shorter focal length imaging resource test indicate good good sharpness similar older sigma focus speed sigma fast quiet similar nikon variation auto focus reproducibility seems within reasonable margin error likely noticable photograph zoom action sigma smoother nikon lens somewhat larger heavier nikon chromatic aberration color fringing reported issue many wide angle lens including lens comment shooting high contrast scene outdoors feel significant second copy lens first copy appeared slight back focus problem mm short focal distance indicated variation auto focus performance v manual focus achieve optimal sharpness optically first copy appeared sharp one likely would acceptable user first edit outdoor shot posted gallery lens performed well field yielding good color contrast flaring visible lens tilted towards sun used baseball cap shade lens would also recommend lens hood situation mm sharpness acceptable f center quite soft edge sharpness edge seems fairly good f color fringing quite evident high contrast area near edge image however bright apppear uncorrected x print also quite easy reduce fringing non issue ca correction using adobe c auto focus accurate overall quite pleased lens say outperforms expectation sharpness vignetting wish ca better controlled keep lens however older version f reported good perhaps better respect recommend f lens constant aperature interest,"09 29, 2009",A3NAS03A35FAQ3,Golferguy,,Sigma 10-20 f/3.5 vs Nikon 16-85 3.5-5.6 VR II,1254182400,False,86,1

All issues were solved with this new N900 Router, even though setup FOR ME was tough because we have an old Vonage router that I have to keep and the instructions were terrible regarding setup with other routers (doesn't really say anything about it, they just assume it's your only router).

So, I went to advanced settings, device mode and chose ""Extender Mode"" which just makes it a wireless access point.  And I went the Advanced LAN settings and turned OFF DHCP, which is the service to assign IP addresses, which the Vonage router already does, and since it's first in line after the cable modem, it's best to let it do that.  Also, in ""Extender Mode"" DO NOT connect this to your other router in the N900 yellow internet port!  Use one of the regular ethernet ports!  They don't tell you this but you will have nothing but problems if you do.  I also had to change the N900's IP address to 192.168.1.101 instead of the default, which is already my Vonage router's address in my LAN.

I was in love with the last one but, sadly, I fell prey to the ""new machine"" illness currently sweeping the land, i.e., I got a machine preloaded with #@&*#@ Windows Vista.  Nothing worked on the new machine that I'd been so comfy with on the old machine, not even my beloved mouse.

(They don't tell you, those tricksey salespeople, that when you buy Vista, you'll have to buy ""updated"" versions of all your current programs, too, programs like Paint Shop, all your games [like Scrabble, Boggle and Bejeweled] and your virus protection programs.  And WOW does that upgrading move quickly into some serious dollars!)

So I had to get another mouse, one that was Vista-compatible.

This mouse is as good as any I've used from this company and better than a couple.  The ergonomics is superb.  It fits smoothly into my hand and I don't have to reach for anything; it's all there at the slightest touch of fingertips or my thumb.  I love the very, very dark blue color--plain black or black/silver was getting a tad boring and I didn't even know it.  Another good thing is that once you begin to use to use the mouse for the first time, it guides you to a site wherein you can easily, painlessly, download the software for the mouse, right there at the site.  No more tiny strings of numbers to read off boxes that have already gone into the recycling bin.  I LOVE that!

This is a wonderful mouse.  It's got a lot of power and oomph for a small price.  You want a really good, basic cordless mouse?  This is the one for you, in my opinion.

3759,492110,492110,B00LP6CFAQ,,4.0,"Edit: Two weeks after posting this review, the battery life precipitously dropped to 40 minutes. Then, a week later to 30 minutes. Now the unit won't even charge enough to pair. So it worked fine but not for long. I'm not changing the star rating because I suspect I got a defective unit as a sample.

This is a well functioning Bluetooth headphone set. The phones come in a nice case making them travel well. The wire holding the two earpieces forms a spring which folds the phones back into position to fit into the case and also create a tension holding them to you allowing for even vigorous movement without danger of the phones falling off.

The earpieces are finished in shiny black which is all the rage today in audio devices. The multifunction switch is located in the inside of the kidney shaped right earpiece making it easy to find. However the multicolor LED which you need to consult to determine the state of the multifunction button or charging status is nearby and not easy to see. My huge hands weren't able to control the gain control while the phones were in place. Someone with smaller delicate hands would, no doubt, have better luck.

The phones pair easily. The sound is as expected or on par with inexpensive wired headphones. It's more than good enough for speech and decent for music. The range is quite good. After pairing, I left the source machine (an iPhone) in the sunroom and wandered all over the yard even out of sight of the sunroom (around a corner) never losing the signal. The headphones stayed in place even during gardening which includes a lot of movement and bending.

The sample provided here included the case, a charging cord (USB to micro USB) and two optional set of ear seals (larger and smaller than standard). If the manufacturer could solve the problem of too small controls which, due to the small size of the unit will be challenge, these phones would be perfect.

390,193800,193800,B0042A68R8,,4.0,"TL;DR version:

These headphones offer an impressive combination of quality and comfort, especially for the price. Excellent for home use, but not a very good choice for use in public, and you will want an aftermarket cable for mobile use. If you are new to high-quality headphones like me, you will probably be quite satisfied with these. If you don't care about bass too much, I suggest you go up to the HD 558s, as they will be more comfortable and have a wider soundstage. Or maybe even the HD 598s. These headphones are not very bassy, nor very bright; If this signature is not what you are going for, I would suggest you give a look at Sony, Shure, Grado, and Audio-Technica models in the $70-$150 price range, as they also look to be very smart options for both closed- and open-backed headphones.

+ Impressive clarity and soundstage with a balanced and relaxed blend of bass, mid-range, and treble, the latter of which is not sibilant at all
+ Requires no additional hardware, such as amplifiers or sound cards.
+ Very comfortable cloth padding which offers a firm fit, even during exercise
+ Interchangeable cables with a locking mechanism

+/- Build quality seems good for what it is made out of, but it doesn't feel particularly tough

- Default 3.5mm adapter is bulky, as is the separate HD5x8 3.5mm cable from Sennheiser, hindering mobile use
- Leaks more sound than some other open-backed headphones

In-depth review + background:

For starters, I am not an audiophile in the least. But I will probably be one, some day. I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my old and reliable Logitech H390 headset. If you want you can skip this paragraph, which is just a background and the difference between the 5x8 models. I've put many, many hours into researching headphones in order to make a smart purchase. I originally was looking for those great bang-for-your-buck headphones in the $30-$50 range, like the Panasonic RP-HTF600S, JVC HARX700, and so on, and I almost bought the Panasonics! But I felt that there were too many sacrifices in that low budget range (and indeed there will still be with these, but not enough to make me regret anything). I could get something fun, but it wouldn't have all the features that I wanted, and vice versa. Then, I found the HD 5x8 range just sitting there right outside of my budget. The 518, 558, and 598 all have the same sound drivers, and the main difference between them is a gradual shift from bass to treble and with each succeeding headphone having a wider soundstage and more comfortable fit. I wanted as much bass as I could get out of this line, so I opted for the 518. The price difference also may have had a part in that decision.

There may be objectively better sounding headphones around this price range. There may be funner headphones around this price range. But I think that these headphones have one of the best combinations of sound quality and features you can get without investing more money into additional hardware. Do you need an amp for these headphones? No. I have yet to put my volume higher than 50% on both my PC and my smartphone, at least in regards to music. (But I have heard people recommend an amp for boosting the bass) Do you need a sound card? No, I put some time into that as well. A budget sound card shouldn't make much of a difference at all. If you're getting a higher end sound card, why are you using it with these entry-level headphones? These are just great with onboard audio, assuming your motherboard is relatively modern.

SOUND SIGNATURE AND QUALITY: When I was looking for headphones, I was looking for a sound signature that did not have any artificial-sounding bass, nor should it have any sibilance in the treble. I wanted headphones that had a respectable oomph to the bass when the song called for it, and I also required a wide soundstage to offer great instrument separation. I listen to a lot of jazz, swing (classic and electronic), funk, r&b, soul, 70s-80s pop, new age, meditation music, a bit of choir, opera, and classical, and a whole lot of metal (traditional, thrash, death, black, sludge, doom, progressive, experimental, you name it). But most importantly, I listened to a lot of music with reverb, lots of instruments, and/or a lot of intricate layers. I wanted to explore the music, appreciate every instrument, and discover little vocal tracks or ambient noises hiding underneath the surface. Either incidentally or intentionally, a lot of music I listen to has a dirty recording (I was worried I would hate everything that was intentionally low-fi. But that was not the case).

These headphones delivered EXACTLY what I was looking for! Or at least after some burn-in. And if the above description sounds like what you are looking for too, then yes obviously I highly recommend these. Right out of the box, cymbals were sharp and layers sounded melted together, but these issues reversed rather quickly. Everything sounds crisp, and each sound gets its own corner. These headphones deliver a pleasurable, but not emphasized, bass to satisfy many people. I realize how flat and boring headsets sound now, these Sennheisers offer a TEXTURE and suddenly my music has mass. Hidden bass riffs are revealed, downtuned riffs sound visceral, and bass kicks more like bass punches you know what I mean? If you are looking for bass that you could swim in, these are not for you unfortunately. I could focus on so many lesser sounds in my music that I struggled to find before. Lyrics, which may have been hidden before, are now clear. My situational awareness in first-person shooters is also heightened now. Before I could only tell the vague direction in which an enemy was moving about. The binaural sound was so effective that at times I thought one of my drivers failed. Explosions and gunshots, if properly produced, sound quite a bit more forceful too. I am not big on the sound production in movies, so I can't really speak for that audience. On the matter of ASMR, the bass response and soundstage benefit the microphone manipulation and 3D audio considerably. Perhaps it would sound 100% genuine if the artists had professional production skills and/or equipment and/or more creative techniques. Not to say that they are bad; it's not about the authenticity anyway.

CORD & MOBILE USE CONSIDERATIONS: These headphones have a open-backed design, and I shouldn't have to tell you that these leak a lot of sound. However I kinda do, because these leak a lot more than other open-backed headphones I've come across. On a volume that I consider normal and fun, and in a controlled environment (completely silent house), I was able to faintly hear the sound from my room out in the hallway, over 25 feet! Of course that was with the door open, too. I would NOT recommend these for use in libraries or any similar quiet place that requires productivity unless you are going putting the volume rather low. In which case, somebody sitting next to you shouldn't notice.

The cord (thank the lord) is detachable and locks into place. This was one of the features I wanted when considering my options. The default cord feels pretty solidly built, but it is just normal rubber. A deep plastic sound is heard in the left ear when it is manipulated. About ten feet in length, ending with a 6.3mm plug and it comes with a 3.5mm adapter. In my environment, that is great because I can do yoga, operate my elliptical or exercise bike, and lay on my bed across the room while still listening to my music or whatever. More on the fit during those actions later. Sennheiser makes a 4.5 foot cable with a 3.5mm plug and 6.3mm adapter, however it looks just as bulky in width, which will probably stop you from plugging this into your smartphone if it has a case on it. Yes, you will have to take the case off for a proper connection. And if you do, the 6.3mm + 3.5mm adapter will induce an unsightly ~3 inch protrusion upon your mobile device.

HOWEVER, there are third-party cables being made by NewFantasia and sold here on Amazon. These appear to be of high quality and come in an unnecessary amount of lengths, ending in normal-sized 3.5mm plugs, and may come with braided cables or an in-line mic + volume control (the latter one does seem to affect sound quality and it's pretty short so I find the short cable + away-from-the-desktop controls to be useless). If you are going to take these for mobile use, I suggest you add one of NewFantasia's cables to your shopping cart as well.

BUILD QUALITY & FIT: It's all a bunch of hard plastic and it's fairly light, but it doesn't necessarily feel flimsy. I imagine it could take a few drops, as my flimsy H390 have taken many beatings over the years and still work great. Manipulating the headphones does not cause any creaking noises, which is good, and I do not feel like they will break in my hands. The earcups have a nice bit of movement to adjust to your head near-perfectly. At first the fit was a little tight, but they've broken in quite nicely. The soundstage seems to be best when you adjust the headphones so that your ears sit in the back. I wear glasses, and these will make a sort of squeaking noise if I move my head around certain ways due to the glasses rubbing against the cloth earpads, but it doesn't bother me often, and you can just hold the headphones in place when you move your head to the side to stop them from rubbing together. Oh yeah the earpads. They're cloth. And they are rather comfortable, firm but a little squishy.

These headphones aren't uncomfortable in the least. I usually wear them for the good part of my day, being a total nerd. But I do feel pretty relieved when I take them off. Unfortunately the ear cups are too big to wear these headphones around my neck comfortably. I feel like I have a neck brace on when trying to move my head about. I mentioned I do yoga with these, and lay down with them on as well. Yes you can do these things, and comfortably! The ears may get warm during exercise, but they will not get as hot as if you had leather or pleather earpads. These will stay on up-side down, but they will slide back if you tilt your head backwards. Wearing these backwards or wearing the headband towards your forward remedies this, however.

This really gives you the options for many advanced features (vLAN, Firewall Zones, Bridging, Advanced DHCP, DDNS Support, UPnP(Universal Plug and Play), etc). If you don't need advanced features, it still gives you fast speeds and is easy to setup and use.

I ran some speed tests and on the 5 ghz network I was getting the top speeds advertised by my ISP and on the 2.4 ghz network I was getting nearly top speeds as well (which is fantastic considering it is the 2.4ghz network.

The configuration page has a basic and advanced mode. The basic mode is clearly designed for smartphones and is a bit awkward when using on your computer. The advanced mode is based on OpenWRT and has almost all the options you would expect to see on OpenWRT. I wish they would just put stock OpenWRT on it (though... I think in theory, you probably could install that yourself).

My main complaint with this is that I feel that the antenna range is not great or powerful enough. When I am in the same room as the router, I am getting top speeds on the 5 ghz network. As soon as I go to my bedroom (which is through walls, but probably no further than 25', the internet becomes so slow it is not usable. I have had no issues with the 2.4ghz network.

I think if you plan on being in the same room, or very near this router, then it will perfectly suite your needs.

4383,32799,32799,B0007MXZB2,,2.0,"This antenna looks like an effective design, with an impressive UHF array and 44-inch VHF elements that collapse nicely into the body when not needed (as with all digital stations prior to Feb 2009).  Additionally, the VHF elements should be useful after Feb '09 when some digital channels migrate from UHF to VHF.

But the proof is in received signal strength, and actual measurements with this antenna compared to a basic 7-inch UHF loop (like you find on the cheapest rabbit-ears indoor antenna) were a major disappointment.  A channel 35.1 signal that measured 60 (out of 100) with the loop was only 55 with the HDTVa, with its amplifier properly connected and turned off.  Turning it on produced no significant improvement.  Bypassing the amplifier was far worse, less than 40.

I found it curious that the worst performance resulted from connecting the antenna directly to the TV, bypassing the amplifier module.  There must be some major impedance mismatch at the antenna's output that the module corrects, which strikes me as a weird design.  You shouldn't have to connect an amplifier to an antenna unless it's needed.

I note that many reviewers here rate it highly, but I wonder if any them did any objective comparison testing.  After all, the antenna WILL work to some degree wherever an indoor signal is possible, but is it superior to anything else?

302,141399,141399,B004LECLV2,,3.0,"I wanted to try the product for several days before I left any review on it. After several days, I feel confident that I can give an accurate assessment of the product. The product is labelled as being made from leather. It does have thick and strong texture like the full grain leather but the backing of the leather leaves me wondering whether it is imitation or synthetic. Leather also has a distinctive leather smell (from the tanning process) and this one is more chemical like. The inside of the cover is lined with synthetic suede. The cover core seems to be made from cardboard and so it is quite stiff. Some people may not mind it but I find I could not fold the front cover to the back of the Nook like I normally do with paperback book covers. The cardboard core stiffness did not give me confidence that it was a high quality product.

The way the color Nook is placed in this product is to slide it in from the top. It does have the appropriate openings for the volume controls, the off switch and the jack for the microUSB. The challenge for me was the zipper part sort of blocks the clean entry of the microUSB plug into the Nook and also pushing the microUSB into the Nook would make the Nook slide out this ""leather"" cover. Since it was so easy to slide the Nook in and out, I thought that this could present the danger if I had the cover unzipped and I had it upside down that the Nook could fall out the cover and into the ground (HORROR!!). So I am making the habit to at least zip the top part of this cover so it will not happen.

It is my opinion that the price I paid for is a little high for this product. It is stylish and protective for the Nook and OK for utility. The stand is only for horizontal landscape mode and if I was reading email, I would have to turn the Nook in vertical mode and this cover does not seem to have the facility and so I have to hold it in my hands.

ADDENDUM:

I had this cover on my Nook for a while and it is when I am reading the Nook that I notice strongly that I cannot set the Nook on its stand to read a book because of the horizontal stand. Nook Books are only for the vertical direction. So I have to hold it in my hand all the time or lay it flat on the table.

ADDENDUM 2:

There was a second Nook at home and despite the shortcomings of its inability for this cover to stand vertically, the positives outweighed the negative and so I purchased a SECOND ONE. And I realized why one commenter mentioned the velcro thing for this cover. The second one had a small case within the cover that was attached with Velcro. This model was more stable than the one I have as it did have Velcro on top to keep the Nook from sliding out. I purchased this from pcmicro store on a well known auction site as it was being charged for less than here and this same seller is selling here too.",wanted try product several day left review several day feel confident give accurate assessment product product labelled made leather thick strong texture like full grain leather backing leather leaf wondering whether imitation synthetic leather also distinctive leather smell tanning process one chemical like inside cover lined synthetic suede cover core seems made cardboard quite stiff people may mind find could fold front cover back nook like normally paperback book cover cardboard core stiffness give confidence high quality product way color nook placed product slide top appropriate opening volume control switch jack microusb challenge zipper part sort block clean entry microusb plug nook also pushing microusb nook would make nook slide leather cover since easy slide nook thought could present danger cover unzipped upside nook could fall cover ground horror making habit least zip top part cover happen opinion price paid little high product stylish protective nook ok utility stand horizontal landscape mode reading email would turn nook vertical mode cover seem facility hold hand addendum cover nook reading nook notice strongly cannot set nook stand read book horizontal stand nook book vertical direction hold hand time lay flat table addendum second nook home despite shortcoming inability cover stand vertically positive outweighed negative purchased second one realized one commenter mentioned velcro thing cover second one small case within cover attached velcro model stable one velcro top keep nook sliding purchased pcmicro store well known auction site charged le seller selling,"05 9, 2011",A28AOYX0UWTI66,psat,,Decent and stylish protection for the Nook Color,1304899200,True,38,0

2752,725680,725680,B00AUCV25K,,4.0,"OK I researched this and many other head units and decided on this one since I will probably replace the vehicle in a few years.

Overall, I think that it is an excellent unit with lots of bells and whistles for the money. I find the menus to be intuitive and pretty well thought out overall.  The intuitive part is good, as the documentation (ie, manual) is as others have said, horrible.  You can tell that it has been translated 6 times at least, with the final one being English.  You are much better spending a few minutes figuring things out than relying on the manual.  It does teach you the basics though.

One thing that should be noted is that a number of people commented that the unit's screen goes black for no reason, and those people suggest that the unit is broken.  In reality, I think that most people are touching the screen brightness setting, in the upper right hand corner, which has as a setting, a dark screen, I guess for those that don't want all the visual displays at night.  All you have to do is touch the upper right corner, and it will toggle back to the visual display being on mode.  I am not suggesting that  no one experienced a broken screen, but I can see that many might confuse this feature for a broken screen as it seems unlikely that so many people experienced it.  It happened to me, but I quickly figured it out.

I find that the navigation works well, although I am not a big user of navigation.  I prefer researching where you are going prior to leaving for a destination.  I have tried it several times though (my wife actually), and it does work well and has lots of features within the navigation software that you can use.

Everything else works well, and overall I am very happy with the unit.  I like using the stylus that it comes with, having 18 presets for FM and 12 for AM is great, having usb, 3.5mm aux-input jack and SD card capabilities is great, the remote works fine once you memorize all the button locations and functions, the bluetooth connects quickly and the DVD works great,  Plus, you can configure the unit to recognize many steering wheel controls without having to buy a $50 interface (check your vehicle though to verify if it is compatible; maybe email the company. They seem to get pretty high marks for customer service, and quickly answered a question that I had about the unit)

There is a lot of customization if you wish (except display colors) and it sounds much better than the OEM premium sound system head that the car came with.  What more can you ask for, for ~$250?  However, I take a star off for the lousy manual.  Also, don't forget to download the navigation manual from the iGO Primo website.  If it is supposed to come with it, mine did not, but it was easy enough to get.  At 89 pages, I do not fault them for not printing it for everyone.  You can spend $400 or more and get less features for other units.  This one is a no brainer IMO.  You just have to be willing to take some time to figure things out, but that is the same for any new piece of electronic equipment, especially one with this many features.",ok researched many head unit decided one since probably replace vehicle year overall think excellent unit lot bell whistle money find menu intuitive pretty well thought overall intuitive part good documentation ie manual others said horrible tell translated time least final one english much better spending minute figuring thing relying manual teach basic though one thing noted number people commented unit screen go black reason people suggest unit broken reality think people touching screen brightness setting upper right hand corner setting dark screen guess want visual display night touch upper right corner toggle back visual display mode suggesting one experienced broken screen see many might confuse feature broken screen seems unlikely many people experienced happened quickly figured find navigation work well although big user navigation prefer researching going prior leaving destination tried several time though wife actually work well lot feature within navigation software use everything else work well overall happy unit like using stylus come presets fm great usb mm aux input jack sd card capability great remote work fine memorize button location function bluetooth connects quickly dvd work great plus configure unit recognize many steering wheel control without buy interface check vehicle though verify compatible maybe email company seem get pretty high mark customer service quickly answered question unit lot customization wish except display color sound much better oem premium sound system head car came ask however take star lousy manual also forget download navigation manual igo primo website supposed come mine easy enough get page fault printing everyone spend get le feature unit one brainer imo willing take time figure thing new piece electronic equipment especially one many feature,"03 1, 2014",A2992OI8MACEN1,Hopmeister,,GREAT head unit for the money!,1393632000,True,,1

So far so good (two weeks) on a Mac with 10.10.3 Yosemite.  I'm hoping that 10.10.4 doesn't mess things up.  Wish ioSafe made a Firewire version.  I'm on an older Mac with nothing but sad slow USB2 and Firewire.  This drive is doing all it can with USB2 but Firewire would have made a vast difference.

Started right out of the box.  Sooooo SILENT, I mean NOT A SOUND, that I called their tech support thinking it was dead.  I hadn't even looked to the front for the tiny blue light (idiotic I know).  The USB cord is thick and sturdy.  Jack ends are secure.

Tech support was kind when I called to ask was it DOA.  Even offered a free new cord when their new cord comes out.  Current one is an off the rack brick made in China whose ends don't insert fully.  Nothing fails just feels and looks odd which is why I thought the unit might be a dud.  Pics added so you can see what I mean.

I'm just hoping the unit lasts like my La Cie Neil Poulton.  I was at wits end as to what to buy. La Cie certainly doesn't have the rep it had back when I bought that drive in 2008.  No usb/firewire drive had a better than 30% rapid failure rate based upon reviews except this brand and Glyph.  The Glyph I purhcased failed in less than one month.  I was very concerned that some say ioSAFE is writing their own five star reviews and they fail as often as any other plus their free data restore seems to disappoint.  I assure you this is regular old me and I had no interest in their Tee Shirt giveway (offered for writing any kind of a review).

Setup was simple with the included wires and diagram. I had difficulty getting a signal from my cable box at first and tried to troubleshoot with the Elgato website. As it turns out, the problem was with my cable box and not the EYE TV. I have a Scientific Atlanta 8300HD from Time Warner Cable which as I understand is a very common DVR model. The problem that I had was that my box was plugged into my TV via HDMI at the same time as I was trying to connect it to the EYE TV and the box will only push the signal through one of two outputs (HDMI or component) at a time. This was easy to fix, I just had to unplug the HDMI from the cable box and reset the cable box with the EYE TV plugged in, and then it pushed the signal no problem.

1876,12752,12752,B00007KDVK,,5.0,"This is a review I wrote for the router hub and the PC Card. I had already submitted it for the hub and am submitting it here also for the card. The entire review is relevant to both parts of this system. One thing I forgot to mention was that I had called Dell to see what they had available,and they were using a mix of Linksys parts as well. So I decided to go direct with Linksys equipment. Here is the review as submitted.
For an item that was not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I first bought it from Amazon, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.
What about hookup and use? Another 5 star performance. If you have never hooked up a wireless network before, take the advice of the quick start guide that comes with the unit, and use their included CD. They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure it. Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, you can see, that is the best way to go. The setup using the CD is about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. Shutting off what they tell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, results in a delightful install. Not even one glitch. The CD determines your internet connection, then it determines your system configuration, asks a few questions, and bingo you are up and running.
I install the PC Card for laptops as well, and that is just as easy to install. Within 10 minutes your surfing the web from all over the house. No Wires !
Pertaining to the speed issue: Remember when I discuss this that their is a difference between the speed inside of your network, and the the speed you are connecting to the web. I got 54MBps while I was in the same room. When I went into the living room, it went to very good, instead of excellent, and gave me 37MBps. Let's get a perspective here. A standard modem works at 56kbps tops. This router works at 54MBps that's megabyte not kilobyte. Their are 1024 kilobytes in every megabyte. So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem. When hooked up to a Verizon DSL basic connection, you are running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobits on the download end, and 100 to 150 upload speed. I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card. What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.
Faster connect speeds are important when communicating across the network, between machines, like when backing up drives across the network. For that reason, the faster N designated wireless is a little bit more expensive, but a lot faster than G. To go a step farther the ultimate in inter network communications, a hard wired gigabit or 2 gigabit connection rules. So the ultimate is to use an N connection for your router, which is your connection to the slower web, and use the faster N to a portable device, then hook up a gigabit switch, to run your hard wired connections between your devices in the network. I guess I am getting off on a tangent here, so back to the device at hand, which is still the most popular selling adapter.
Anyhow, just for reference, hooking up a DSL, or a broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast, with the Windows XP operating system, installation was as near automatic as can be. They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.
All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. Follow the directions exactly. It is easy. Hope this helps. This is the reason why I have a website, to help people with their installations. Did you know that as much as 30 percent of the wireless network products are sent back, because people give up trying to install them? Let's all save Amazon from the return product blues.

I listen mostly metal (Dream Theater and the likes) and you can hear every single note on every instrument. The included mic is good quality for calling.
These are compatible with anything. I've use it on my ipad for face time and on my note 3 the button works for skipping tracks.

Update: 10/09/2014
V moda claims this headphones are indestructible, well they are not. A week ago the left earpiece stopped sounding. I haven't been using these very harshly, just for my phone and for my computer at home so nothing extreme. I'm still under warranty so I contacted V moda, to me this is not good customer service, the guy that I was chatting with didn't introduce himself and was talking in casual lingo with words like, that's cool, hurry up. I mailed my headphones and they arrived there 2 days ago. The only thing I got so far was an automated emailed saying they received my headphones, nothing more after that.
Will update this part after I'm done with my warranty telling you guys how it went.

I emailed them to see what happened since I haven't gotten any updates on my warranty claim and according to the person responding, it can take up to two weeks for them to get them repaired. I never had to wait so much for a warranty claim, they are headphones not rocket ships. Anyway worst customer support ever.

Second it is 3.3 megapixels for under $.... What more could you ask for?! Well, you may not be able to ask for a lot more, but you sure get it.
Before I bought this camera I did a lot of research. I even visited some of the local camera shops and electronics stores to get a feel for the different cameras before I ordered one on the net. Boy, it sure paid off.  There were some that had a body made of plastic. I don't intend to spend $... on something that is made of plastic. Others were very small and were uncomfortable to hold. The Minolta is the perfect size and weight.
When I hooked it up to my system for the first time, I was able to upload pictures in minutes.  Another nice feature is that you can take up to 60 Seconds worth of video, very nice. The video even loads up to the system easily.
In addition it uses a Compactflash card. These are pretty reasonably priced. A 16 MB card came with the camera. Most of the pictures I have taken so far are about 500K, so you can store quite a few pictures. I also purchased a 128 MB card at a good price here on ..., so I have plenty of space to store pictures before committing them to CD via my system.
I only have one warning. You need to buy Ni-MH batteries. Then charge them for at least 24 hours, the first time. If you don't the camera will keep coming back and telling you that your batteries are dead. When I called support they kept telling me that I had to buy a special brand of batteries. This wasn't the case, you just need to fully charge the batteries.

3867,415498,415498,B00FEE7B1I,,5.0,"I had found that I did not use my 10"" android tablet at work as often as I thought I would.  It's a latest generation Samsung, and it's great, but it was too big for me to conveniently carry everywhere.  I checked, and most 8"" tablets would fit in my pants pocket.  I started looking, and I ordered this on a whim because Dell was selling a refurb for barely more than the cost of a Microsoft Office home and Student license (which is included).

It turns out I really like it a lot. I have barely used my larger (and much more expensive) tablet since I got this one.  I have read a lot of reviews from folks who have picked up an iPad mini or similar sized tablets who wind up preferring them to larger ones, and I will echo those thoughts.

Beyond the size, the reason I like it so much (again to my GREAT surprise) is Windows 8.1.  Really.  My family has two modern, powerful touch-screen laptops with Windows 8.1 on them.  I really don't like it in that application.  The ""metro"" (yes, I know that's not its real name, but it seems to be what folks still call it) touch screen interface is just horrible to me on a laptop.  I installed Classic Shell (which brings back the Start menu and boots to desktop mode) on my laptops, which really just about ""fixes"" what most folks hate about Windows 8.1. Still, sometimes you are forced into the metro screen, and it is still annoying.

BUT putting Windows 8.1 on a tablet changes everything.  The metro interface is clearly designed for tablet use, and it really shines there.  As much as I dislike the metro interface on the laptop, on the tablet, it is the desktop interface that is less satisfying.  The metro apps are fast, easy to use with fingers, and it is easy to switch between apps (all of those gestures, charms and swipes that are odd on a laptop now make perfect sense).  Web surfing, game playing and video watching are all as good as on any tablet I've used.  Having the built-in Word and Excel and the ability to run Windows programs are great bonuses (I even installed Civ 5 and played the touch-screen version. It's playable on this tablet, although the wait between turns is longer than on a modern full PC).

Even Internet Explorer (with one caveat) is a pleasure.  The swipe navigation is helpful, intuitive  and easy to use on a tablet.

Microsoft and Intel made some huge missteps in the launch of Windows 8 and windows tablets.  The first generation's Clover Trail atom processors were just not really up to the task of running a full desktop OS fluidly enough for many users.  The new Bay Trail atom processors are (no, they are not Haswell class, but they are not supposed to be that fast, either).

Having desktop and laptop users forced into a tablet desktop was also a terrible idea, but it sounds like Microsoft is finally realizing it.  The metro interface being run on a tablet with a powerful enough processor is great.  The Dell's screen is good, and is a pleasure to use.

Here are my nits, but none would deter me from recommending the tablet to a friend:

1.  The windows store is getting better, but it is far behind Google Play, much less Apple's app store in many areas.  I've been able to find an app for most of what I want to do, but the selection is nothing like the other ecosystems.

2. Here is the caveat for Internet Explorer.  Bing is integrated into the search feature.  Yes, you can go to the Google home page to run a search, but it's a pain and I wish Microsoft would let that thing go already.

Edit May 2, 2014:

I just was out of town and tried to use a capacitive stylus to annotate some PDF presentation slides.  You can't do that in the standard viewer app, but there are several apps available from the Windows store for relatively low cost.  I tried a couple, and unfortunately, I found it unworkable.  All I had was (a relatively good) capacitive stylus.  It was horrible.  It skipped so much as to make the annotations pointless.

This thing is seriously such a piece of garbage I had to come on here and warn people.

I bought this because it said it also streamed netflix.  (along with pandora etc..)

First thing I find out is IT DOES NOT HAVE WIFI!  YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE A ""WIFI DONGLE"" FOR 24.95

This was a minor setback/annoyance.

However, the main problem is with the playback of NETFLIX!

NETFLIX DOES NOT WORK ON THIS THING!!!

IT CONSTANTLY FREEZES UP AND NEEDS TO BE UNPLUGGED.

PLAYBACK HAS *CONSTANT* PROBLEMS!!!  CHOPPING VIDEO, SKIPPING, SOUND ISSUES

LOCKS UP AND NEED TO BE UNPLUGGED MANY TIMES A DAY!!!!

Also, once you start it back up, it won't let you go to anything but the ""Disc"" even if there is no disc in there you still have to wait while it looks for one.  And God forbid you actually have a disc in there, then you have to wait for it to play the disc,  and don't bother hitting ""eject"" because that won't work either.  And pressing any button on the remote just gives you a symbol that means ""NO"".  So your only choice every time you start this pile is to WAIT WAIT WAIT.  And YES that even includes if you have a disc in there and you just want to put a different disc in.  You cannot just hit the eject button, you have to turn on the power and let it start up the disc that is in there and then WAIT WAIT WAIT just to change the disc.

Anyway, back to netflix.  I even called Netflix and the CS rep told me they get ""a lot of complains about Philips players"".

5102,361153,361153,B00BTVTA0U,,4.0,"I ordered one of these from a vendor on Amazon, and the product came with scratches on the screen, which I could live with.  What I could not live with, though, is that the video would tend to freeze when a file was playing back, after about 30 seconds or so into it.  This was true whether I chose five-minute or two-minute recordings, and occurred on two different micro cards (16Gb and 32GB), thus the unit itself was clearly at fault.  So, I sent that one back.

I ordered a second one from eBestrade, and it seems to work okay.  This time the screen came with a protective cover that I peeled off, and the unit records and plays back without issue. The only negative, as a few other reviews have noted, is that the back camera recordings are inverted, meaning it's like you're viewing the video image from a mirror.  Street signs read backwards, and it looks like you're driving in England...everything is reversed.  Apparently they all have this defect.

Interestingly, you'll notice that this same design is sold by quite a few vendors at different prices, some shipped from the US, some shipped from the US with Amazon Prime as an option, and some shipped from China or Hong Kong. From what I can tell, though, they all have the same features. The first one I purchased was packaged in a completely different box than the second, but other than that they both had exactly the same functionality.

I chose this particular design because it is the only one I found with a detachable, wired rear camera.  Many accidents are caused by being hit from behind, so I didn't want a dash cam that only recorded what was going on in the front of my vehicle.

The unit records into two files, one for the front camera and one for the rear.  It will take up to a 32GB micro SD card.  I have a 16GB in mine, which is easily sufficient because it loop records, meaning it will start to record over the older files once the card fills up.  With my 40-mile round trip to work, I can record several days worth of driving before it starts to record over the older files.

I have found the picture quality from both cameras, front and rear, to be adequate.  You will NOT be able to read license plates from either camera...definitely not from the back camera (it would be inverted anyway), and not from the front camera either, unless conditions are absolutely perfect (vehicle stopped, close, and very bright lighting).  So, if someone side-swipes you and takes off, you'll get video of the car speeding away, but that will be about it.

On the other hand, though, if some idiot cuts you off, or plows into you from behind, and an accident does unfortunately occur, you'll have very good footage of what took place.

The unit is very small and very light.  So small, I have to get a magnifying glass to read the menu choices on the screen.  The settings for it are many...you can pretty much tweak it to do whatever you want it to do.  You will, though, need to play around with the buttons to figure out how to find, select and save your choices.  The written instructions are pretty bad (mine came in both English and Chinese), so learning through trial and error is really the best way.

It seems to work fine for what it is made for. Don't expect a solid, well-built, name-brand Sony or Samsung type product.  This is a low-cost, Chinese manufactured device.  Both of the units I bought came with English menus already activated.  It mounts securely to the windshield, and is not at all noticeable when you're driving if you place it strategically.  Also note that even though the wire connecting the rear camera is really long, to get the wire hidden away in my SUV (an Armada), I am going to need to get an extension cable.  I don't think this will be necessary in most cars, though.

The unit will power on and off with the vehicle as long as you have it plugged into a 12-volt socket that also powers on and off with the vehicle. Some of the sockets in my SUV are constantly on, so I have purchased a splitter (this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Multi-Use-Vehicle-Charger-with-Dual-USB-Ports-and-Dual-12-Volt-Sockets-Magnadyne/dp/B000PB8CQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Multi-Use Vehicle Charger with Dual USB Ports and Dual 12 Volt Sockets - Magnadyne</a>) to accommodate it, since I also have an external GPS unit that also needs to power on and off with the vehicle.  The dash cam stays on for about 15 seconds after the ignition is switched off.

Considering all of the above, for what you get for $70 (as of this writing), I consider this dash cam a four-star deal.

1977,630982,630982,B016ZOCE8K,,5.0,"The D-Scope V2 is easily one of the best cheap VR / Cardboard solutions on the market. Here's a quick guide:

Pros:

-Easy setup. Slide the D-scope out of its protective sleeve, follow the on-box instructions. This basically consists of removing a hook-and-loop fastener, folding a piece back, inserting your phone, and replacing the fastener. Extremely easy.

-Everything included. For those who don't know, Google Cardboard uses a standardized QR Code to import settings necessary to configure your phone to work with each VR headset. Many factors influence

-Excellent kit. The lenses are large, and unlike the v1 setup are better mounted for clearer visibility. This setup is as good as it gets for Google Cardboard. There's even an included magnetic ""button"", which works out of the box on most phones to help you interact with most apps without having to reach into the viewer.

-Yes, it has a ""Grease patch"". Many people complain that Cardboard kits need a piece of tape over the nose piece to keep people's greasy faces from ruining the cardboard. This kit comes standard with that piece of tape, which can easily be refreshed with any roll of household packing tape.

-I got my D-scope up and running, including downloading and setting up apps, inside of ten minutes. Fast and simple.

Cons:

-You will almost certainly have to pull your phone out of any protective case to use it in the D-Scope, as it expects a very slim phone. Nearly all modern phones will fit in the range of screen size 4-6"". My MotoG 2014 fits perfectly. But do check the listed dimensions.

-Not everyone can use 3d headset. I'll give more detail below.

Common pitfalls:

-A significant portion of the population don't see 3d ""correctly"". Even if you navigate your daily life just fine, there are a lot of fine problems that could affect your ability to see VR, which only your eye doctor can diagnose. For example, a good portion of the population have eyesight where one eye is dominant over the other. In daily life, this has no effect whatsoever on your vision. But when you use VR headsets, the designers assume your eyes are equally dominant. This means people with perfectly fine vision will be unable to use a VR headset like this, they'll have double vision or blurriness using the VR headset. If you've followed all the instructions and still can't see your Cardboard correctly, talk about it with an optometrist.

-But some people can train their eyes! I personally had an issue where my eyes change dominance, rarely ever meeting in the happy middle that VR headsets expect. With some training using online 3d eye tests, I was able to examine this issue, and now once I put on my D-scope I just need to take a few seconds to calm my eyes and I see the 3d just fine. Search around, the medical field is still catching up and there's an astonishing lack of good information out there.

-To troubleshoot your settings, use the Google Cardboard profiler, and you need to know your pupillary distance (or inter-pupillary distance, PD, which you can obtain for free from any optometrist by request). My personal PD is 62, when most VR systems cater to the ""normal"" range of 50-55mm, and Google Cardboard generally caters up to 60mm. This means I cannot use most 3d glasses, they just aren't built for my eyes. Using the D-Scope still isn't perfect, but Google has an online profiler that can generate a new QR code that I can use to dial in my settings. Just do a Google search for Google Cardboard profiler, and follow the instructions to dial in your settings.

-And yes, you have to download and set up VR apps to use the headset. The VR industry is still very new, so none of this is ""plug and play"" yet.

There are a lot of details that I like about these earphones.
The construction of these earphones are great.
The flat cord is design is always more durable than the old round style,
The cord is 35 inches long. 35 inches - that's a long cord. You can easily thread this cord through any clothing ports, if need be..
The carry case is small and efficient.
They stay in my ears and do not fall out easily
I like the sound of the titanium and black pegs.

Con
The only Con is what actually make these earbuds different. It's the interchangeable sound pieces. They could be potentially easy to lose. I've dropped one every time I have tried to change them. Otherwise these are excellent earbuds!

1924,130476,130476,B001F7AHY6,,1.0,"I've been resistant to Apple products largely because I have an aversion to cults and situations that involve a preponderance of groupthink. Aside from that, while I don't necessarily dispute the idea that apple produces 'quality' products (in the sense that they use better than average grade materials/components) apple sells essentially feature neutered products at multiples of the price of other comprable devices that are aimed at creating a user base that is enslaved to their ecosystem. In particular, simple things like swapping out a battery, the ability to add external storage or just drag and drop of you files are anathema in the apple world. That is a great business model for a corporation. Personally I find this situation rather amusing considering how many 'creative', artsy-fartsy, sandals and starbucks type people (in other words the very types who rail against 'the man' and corporations) rush to apple with open arms and wallets... So it comes as no real surprise that followers are once again feeling the knife twist in their belly while enjoying that warm fuzzy apple embrace as the ipod classic is quietly discontinued to make way for (what is likely) the eventual rise of apple's itunes-beats hybrid  streaming music service world. A world where you get to pay the same but don't actually own anything. 1984 at it's coporate best.
And from where did this anti-apple tirade come? I was finally going to give in and get my wife one of these (she's been wanting to put her entire music collection on a single device for easy access) only to find that they've been discontinued and now the price has doubled for the few remaining units out there that have avoided the mandated return to the apple dungeons. $500 for this thing?
