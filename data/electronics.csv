2182,B0056C7SWK,,4.0,"I have been averse to universal remotes for a while.  I've tried two in the past, and they either didn't work right, or they took so much setup that I was never sure if I'd done it right, and once the instructions were misplaced I couldn't figure out how to add a device.

I thought this pair of universal remotes, on the other hand, did a good job.

Literally, within five minutes of opening the package I had a remote up and running.

The instructions are as follows:

  Turn on your tv (or other device).

  Select the specific device on the remote (i.e. the tv button, or some other appliance) and hold for 5 seconds until it blinks

  Type in the four digit code of your device (there are 25 common brands with their codes on the ""quick start"" instructions, and a much longer list in the user manual.)

  Press and hold the controller power button and let it go once your device (i.e. your tv) turns off

  Test.

That's it.  It really was that easy.  (And if you make a mistake, you can just exit and restart).

For the price that you pay for this remote, I thought the manufacturer provided just the right ease of use --I was pleasantly surprised.  The only problem I have, and it is not the device's fault, is that it takes a little time for me to figure out which device I want to control, and you have to select the device first, before you can control it.  You can't just turn the tv off, for example, you have to select the tv, and then turn it off.  (Perhaps I'd like the off button to ALWAYS turn off the tv, by default, then I could take my time shutting off the other devices.  Or perhaps there could be a ""master"" off switch, which I could code to turn off the devices I wanted at once...)

The hardware and app were easy enough to connect and download respectively, and to get up and running w power and internet, but the base station was not able to be recognized. I followed the simple short steps and reset to factory default settings as directed many many times. I read through numerous community help comments and saw several people seemed to have had the same problem. I tried some of the fixes that were suggested (powering on, off, plugging in, out, resetting again and again). Just as I was about to give up and wait for morning to call customer service, it picked up my base station.  I am unclear what I did to make that happen, other than following the steps on the app and the forums over and over, so I can't really give any pointers. The few hours I spent trying to just set this up irritated me quite a bit.

When I got the cameras working (they paired very easily once the base station was picked up), I set them up in various parts of my home, and over the next several days tried the devices out. The color is very clear and the night vision very good, and the alerts seemed to be picking up a lot of the movement, especially when I tried them on two sides of the living room w high traffic- so much so that I turned the scheduling on only for times we were out, so I wouldn't get so many beeps on my phone or notification email in my inbox. When the weekend came, I had time to try to install these outside, and the limited wi-fi range (my wifi is fairly strong w a mesh system, but who knows) made it impossible to move the cameras even a few feet away from the walls of the house. One camera is outside our front door facing the courtyard's outer door, and I could not put the other camera outside at all, due to sporadic cut-outs and not working for hours at a time. So I placed it looking outside through a window towards the backyard, but the motion detector did not seem to pick up any movement  through the glass, and it didn't work at night due to the glass reflecting back at the camera. I re-positioned it inside looking at the inside of the backdoor.

Having used these for about a week now, it appears that the cameras only sporadically pick up movement, and you have to be fairly close- no more than about a few feet away.  Also, if you walk quickly through the camera zone, it may not pick up motion. This can be remedied by putting the cameras right next to the entrance you are interested in (it would take some stationary time to break in, but since the cameras are not recording unless the motion detector detects, this system is not reliable enough for security purposes I was desiring.

What the cameras seem best at doing, is monitoring real time inside or immediately outside your home, such as when you want to see your pet or baby sleeping or you hear a noise or something like that. Overall, though, I don't believe these cameras are consistent enough for security based on reliable motion detection. I noticed Arlo Pro provides longer distance motion detection, so this upgrade may be more useful.

Update: i added a star to this- 4 stars, ""I like this,"" because for the purposes of real time monitoring where you can check in and view, this system works very well.",set arlo camera system amount difficulty hardware app easy enough connect download respectively get running w power internet base station able recognized followed simple short step reset factory default setting directed many many time read numerous community help comment saw several people seemed problem tried fix suggested powering plugging resetting give wait morning call customer service picked base station unclear make happen following step app forum really give pointer hour spent trying set irritated quite bit got camera working paired easily base station picked set various part home next several day tried device color clear night vision good alert seemed picking lot movement especially tried two side living room w high traffic much turned scheduling time get many beep phone notification email inbox weekend came time try install outside limited wi fi range wifi fairly strong w mesh system know made impossible move camera even foot away wall house one camera outside front door facing courtyard outer door could put camera outside due sporadic cut out working hour time placed looking outside window towards backyard motion detector seem pick movement glass work night due glass reflecting back camera positioned inside looking inside backdoor used week appears camera sporadically pick movement fairly close foot away also walk quickly camera zone may pick motion remedied putting camera right next entrance interested would take stationary time break since camera recording unless motion detector detects system reliable enough security purpose desiring camera seem best monitoring real time inside immediately outside home want see pet baby sleeping hear noise something like overall though believe camera consistent enough security based reliable motion detection noticed arlo pro provides longer distance motion detection upgrade may useful update added star star like purpose real time monitoring check view system work well,"09 9, 2017",A23P5BO1UGNIRR,KC,{'Configuration:': ' 2 Camera Kit w/ Mount'},"Good For Real-time Monitoring, Somewhat Unreliable Motion Detection",1504915200,False,,1

8307,B00006B8DA,,4.0,"This is a very sturdy and ruggedly built KVM switch from Startech that for the most part delivers what it advertises. First, I do not have any monitors that go above 1080, so I have no way of testing higher resolutions. I am pretty sure that there is an upper limit to what resolution can be obtained from a simple VGA connection though. If you need higher resolution, you would be better off looking for a KVM switch that supports HDMI connections, not VGA.

I was a bit disappointed when I opened the box and found that there were not only no cables (not that they were promised) but no 5V power supply either. I often build and repair my own computers, so I had plenty of 5V adapters laying around. They aren't exactly difficult to find online for cheap, either. However, as it turns out, I have yet to run into a situation where I actually needed to plug-in a power supply. The switch works fine without it on the two Windows and one Linux workstation I have running on the device. Perhaps if you are using the included USB hub to power some external devices you may run into trouble, but for everyday use I have not needed to use a power supply yet. All of the buttons light up fine and the unit seems to work well without one.

Another slight annoyance was the polarity of the KVM cables needed to link between computers and the switch. I had an entire box full of older KVM cables that I thought I would be able to use. It turns out that they are incompatible with this model though. I was able to solve the problem by ordering a handful of VGA gender changer adapters. It would be nice if KVM manufacturers stuck to some sort of standardization though. The previous 3 KVM switches I owned all worked fine with the KVM cables that I already owned.

Setup is ""simple"" in that it is just swapping out a bunch of cables, but don't expect to get it done in 5 minutes. I spent about an hour running cables for my three cables and monitor. Fortunately, there were no real surprises once I got the appropriate cables/adapters though. Performance has been rock solid since installation and I have absolutely no complaints on how the device itself works.",sturdy ruggedly built kvm switch startech part delivers advertises first monitor go way testing higher resolution pretty sure upper limit resolution obtained simple vga connection though need higher resolution would better looking kvm switch support hdmi connection vga bit disappointed opened box found cable promised v power supply either often build repair computer plenty v adapter laying around exactly difficult find online cheap either however turn yet run situation actually needed plug power supply switch work fine without two window one linux workstation running device perhaps using included usb hub power external device may run trouble everyday use needed use power supply yet button light fine unit seems work well without one another slight annoyance polarity kvm cable needed link computer switch entire box full older kvm cable thought would able use turn incompatible model though able solve problem ordering handful vga gender changer adapter would nice kvm manufacturer stuck sort standardization though previous kvm switch owned worked fine kvm cable already owned setup simple swapping bunch cable expect get done minute spent hour running cable three cable monitor fortunately real surprise got appropriate cable adapter though performance rock solid since installation absolutely complaint device work,"01 2, 2017",A10U8DJAPJJI8I,William Hefner,"{'Capacity:': ' 4 Port', 'Style:': ' VGA'}",Like A Rock,1483315200,False,,1

If you have used regular headphones with these ones you will definitely notice the difference. Not a lot of bass like beats. I listen mostly metal (Dream Theater and the likes) and you can hear every single note on every instrument. The included mic is good quality for calling.
These are compatible with anything. I've use it on my ipad for face time and on my note 3 the button works for skipping tracks.

Update: 10/09/2014
V moda claims this headphones are indestructible, well they are not. A week ago the left earpiece stopped sounding. I haven't been using these very harshly, just for my phone and for my computer at home so nothing extreme. I'm still under warranty so I contacted V moda, to me this is not good customer service, the guy that I was chatting with didn't introduce himself and was talking in casual lingo with words like, that's cool, hurry up. I mailed my headphones and they arrived there 2 days ago. The only thing I got so far was an automated emailed saying they received my headphones, nothing more after that.
Will update this part after I'm done with my warranty telling you guys how it went.

Update: 11/09/2014
I emailed them to see what happened since I haven't gotten any updates on my warranty claim and according to the person responding, it can take up to two weeks for them to get them repaired. I never had to wait so much for a warranty claim, they are headphones not rocket ships. Anyway worst customer support ever. Will never buy anything from V moda again and certainly will not recommend them

Indestructible headphones? No way.

This thing is seriously such a piece of garbage I had to come on here and warn people.

I bought this because it said it also streamed netflix.  (along with pandora etc..)

First thing I find out is IT DOES NOT HAVE WIFI!  YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE A ""WIFI DONGLE"" FOR 24.95

This was a minor setback/annoyance.

However, the main problem is with the playback of NETFLIX!

NETFLIX DOES NOT WORK ON THIS THING!!!

IT CONSTANTLY FREEZES UP AND NEEDS TO BE UNPLUGGED.

PLAYBACK HAS *CONSTANT* PROBLEMS!!!  CHOPPING VIDEO, SKIPPING, SOUND ISSUES

LOCKS UP AND NEED TO BE UNPLUGGED MANY TIMES A DAY!!!!

Also, once you start it back up, it won't let you go to anything but the ""Disc"" even if there is no disc in there you still have to wait while it looks for one.  And God forbid you actually have a disc in there, then you have to wait for it to play the disc,  and don't bother hitting ""eject"" because that won't work either.  And pressing any button on the remote just gives you a symbol that means ""NO"".  So your only choice every time you start this pile is to WAIT WAIT WAIT.  And YES that even includes if you have a disc in there and you just want to put a different disc in.  You cannot just hit the eject button, you have to turn on the power and let it start up the disc that is in there and then WAIT WAIT WAIT just to change the disc.

Anyway, back to netflix.  I even called Netflix and the CS rep told me they get ""a lot of complains about Philips players"".

Surprisingly, this unit worked right out of the box. I do have it have it powering 4 rock speakers outside in my yard. The wire clips on the back are sub par, but then again this is an economy amp. I carefully hooked up the speaker wires and left it alone. I would expect if you were to connect and disconnect them a lot, you may have issues. If that were the case, I would plan on connecting some wire with banana plugs on the end so you can reconnect them at will. The expectation of some people may be too much for this $80. price tag. Even though it is a small amp with a small price tag it delivers exactly what I need. I have an iPad plugged in the back via a RCA to  3.5 ""Y"" adapter and a projector audio plugged in through the 3.5 front jack. I also have my wireless cable box audio plugged into the other input. I didn't use the USB input jack nor do I intend to. I feel the power is more than sufficient to power the speakers, and the volume is not half way up.

Funny that I would buy such a high-end TV since I am not a TV watcher, cable and DSL are not even available where I live and I do not have Dish or anything other than a cheap antenna which brings in a handful of local stations.

I mainly use the TV as a computer monitor, being a photographer/videographer. One video camera I have shoots in 3D. I've been using TVs like that since before smart TVs existed. I do not connect the TV to the Internet except to update the OS now and then.

I have watched 2 3D movies on this though and they look great as do 2D. I would have liked the flat screen model but as others have said this is not a very extreme curve and most of the time I do not think about it.

Having said all that, after watching this I realize what a good one my ""old"" Panasonic HD 3DTV is... after 3 years. This one outshines it a bit but considering everything the one I replaced is amazing also and might not sell it because I doubt I'd get what I think it is worth.

6230,B004YIIKK6,,4.0,"10/05/2013 - Have owned this product for 2 weeks and taken it on four 35 minute 4 mile runs so far.
I use this with a Motorola Razr HD Maxx from 2012.

5 star scale.

Fit = *****
Lightweight, fits comfortably, forget you have it on. I am 6ft, 200 lbs. Not huge. Not small. Normal non-George Lopez style head.  Do not be concerned with the size of the discs over your ears like I was. They are small. Not as small as just earbuds. (though they have nice earbuds with two sets of comfortable rubber covers. People can see they are different, but not ridiculously so. People have told me they like the way they look. The discs do not make your ears feel covered or warm. For me that would be a deal breaker in hot weather. These are fine. The disc size makes the controls very ergonomic.  I wear these with no additional support and they DO NOT fall out.

Battery Life = *****
Suites my needs. I run twice for 35 minutes on the weekend. Then I charge it and put it away. Take it out a week later and get 2 runs out of it with power to spare.

Sweatproof = *****
So far so good.  I have had 2 very expensive Motorola S11 fail on me due simply to sweat while running. The design of these seems to keep sweat off important parts pretty well. They have not died yet on some very sweaty runs. I am hopeful. Will update on how these hold up. So far so good.

Ergonomics, controls, buttons = ****
This is one of the best parts of the design. The buttons are REALLY well placed and very easy to access to raise/lower volume or change tracks while running. Pause is so-so, but might be my phone. Sometimes it doesn't pause. Sometimes that starts another music player. Amazon MP3 player doesn't seem to have a setting to tell it not to respond to headset and keeps coming up. Sometimes pause is just ignored.
Starts up, shuts down, pairs readily when button is pressed as directed.

Pairing =  *****
Easy, no hassle pairing.

Reception = *****
When I wear on my right arm as directed, NEVER drops. My moto dropped consistently, but maybe had it on wrong arm. Never tried other one.  If I put this one on my left arm, drops sound like moto.

Sound Quality = ***
Sound is Okay. I can get by with it. Reliability with the sweat issue, makes the sound tolerable. Better so-so sound than no sound.  That said, seems to have limited range. Base is not all that powerful. Treble is better, even so, everything seems to lack dimension.  The $100 Moto S11 blew these away as did my Moto HT820, but for the price and what these are. They are passible. I may look into whether Jaybirds sound better. Will be keeping these though as a nice utility headset.

Call Quality = ****
I am shocked to say that these things don't do too badly on calls. Thus far, no one has complained that they cannot hear me. In that regard, they are better than my S11's which people would always immmediately let me know they couldn't understand me.  I gave them a 4 star on this because I did get a little feedback that I wasn't sounding completely clear.

I solved my quest for knowledge by going to youtube.com to find videos on how to install and set up the camera. Once I got it going I was fine. One show stopper right off the bat was that the cable shipped with the unit was bad. I was getting no lights on the network connection at all. I tried my own cable and bingo, it worked.

Once the camera is set up, it seems to perform and work great. There are some IPHONE and IPAD apps that can be used to control the camera. The app made by EasyN didn't work at all for me. I found another app called Eye Net Camera for my Android that does work, and another free app for the IPAD that worked.

4/12/2013 - Now that I've used this for quite a while I'm even more impressed. It keeps humming along, no issues.

Some points: I couldn't for the life of me get it to work in our business, but I could get it to work at home. It turned out that the wireless router at the business was an older model and wouldn't let the camera connect. Once I replaced the router, bingo, it worked.

The motion alarm is a great feature. We set it so that at night, if someone enters our business, we record them. The video files are uploaded to our FTP website, so even if a thief finds and destroys the camera, they can't get the video unlike most expensive systems.

The software used to set the motion alarm is tedious. They make you click a little square box for each 30 minute timeframe, for each day, that you want to set the alarm. It takes hundreds of clicks to cover the entire night. It would have been easier if they let you SHIFT and drag a whole section of time, but they didn't. If you turn off the alarm , your settings are wiped out and you must do it all again.  That's frustrating.",like chinese product feel cheap get job done like everyone else baffled instruction solved quest knowledge going youtube com find video install set camera got going fine one show stopper right bat cable shipped unit bad getting light network connection tried cable bingo worked camera set seems perform work great iphone ipad apps used control camera app made easyn work found another app called eye net camera android work another free app ipad worked used quite even impressed keep humming along issue point life get work business could get work home turned wireless router business older model let camera connect replaced router bingo worked motion alarm great feature set night someone enters business record video file uploaded ftp website even thief find destroys camera get video unlike expensive system software used set motion alarm tedious make click little square box minute timeframe day want set alarm take hundred click cover entire night would easier let shift drag whole section time turn alarm setting wiped must frustrating,"05 26, 2012",A26Z15QFLWZJ5Z,Scott Ames,,"Works well, if you can figure it out, feels cheap",1337990400,True,,1

The autofocus seems to ""hunt"" more than other cameras too, including my old Canon Powershot and the Lumix (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-Lumix-DMC-LX5-10-1-MP-Digital-Camera-with-3-8x-Optical-Image-Stabilized-Zoom-and-3-0-Inch-LCD-Black/dp/B003WJR69E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD - Black</a>) I got to replace it.

The image quality, even in normal light, is nothing special. The Lumix is quite a bit better, and this is certainly not in the same league as a DSLR. My Canon T3 is only 12 megapixel compared to 16 for this camera, and it takes much, much better shots.

This will do for casual photos, but I expect some of my travel photos to eventually end up in a book, so I need better quality than this camera seems to take. Other reviews say you can tweak this and that to get better quality, but I'm not willing to navigate the menus, because...

I found the interface to be pretty confusing. I eventually navigated through the menus to change the settings I needed, but it was unnecessarily complex and frustrating to do it. There's just no reason for a camera menu to have such a poorly designed user interface.

On the good side, it takes a lot of pictures on a charge, the zoom range is pretty good, and it's very compact. I like the auto lens cap, too.

7267,B00NJ4ARW0,,5.0,"SO glad I found these.  I had been running with normal buds (the type that don't go in your ear canal) and was going crazy resetting them every 15 seconds ... definitely a serious distraction when you're doing hard cardio.  I got these at wally world for 19.99 and used them the same night I bought them.  INSTANT APPRECIATION.

The fidelity of the ear buds is good enough for me.  Listening to some re-mastered Led Zeppelin I definitely heard nuances to the music I've never heard before .. while running hard, about to die, sweating a gallon a minute pounding like a herd of elephants on a treadmill in a gym that pipes constant loud music.  Good enough for me.

The cover design really is the money here.  By using silicon, which has a natural tackiness to it compared to other ""rubber"" and by inserting into the canal their 'put it in and twist' technique REALLY DO keep them in... while running several miles and sweating like a pig, while doing situps, doing all sorts of weird yoga stretches, lifting ... you name it.  My set included two different sets of covers; I experimented with the larger ones but the smaller ones (that were installed as shipped) fit me like a glove.  You can remove and replace them very easily; when you replace them, make sure that you shift them slightly ""off 90 degrees""... left on between 3 and 4 oclock, right one between 8 and 9 oclock.

It takes about two time inserting and removing them to get used to the ""twist lock"" design - after that, they go in and out as quickly and easily as any other earbud. Just hold it upside and put the pointed end in your ear ... then twist down to normal position and they're locked in.

These allow ambient sound in - a plus for situational awareness for sure - but since they direct the music into the ear I found that even at moderate volumes I could hear my music over the gym's music (which is constant and pretty loud).  However, by dropping the volume slightly I could hear what's going on around me and was able to find the right mix of music vs ambient sound pretty easily.  At one point I found myself *directly under* a speaker - these are large speakers, probably 100 watts or more - and I had to turn up the volume some.  At home I was doing some stretches in a room directly connected to the kitchen while someone else was banging around pots and pans, slamming the fridge door - those made it through pretty clearly with the volume at about 50% ... at that point, to coexist with someone banging around pots and pans while Im trying to chill to some Ambient music and stretch I probably would have preferred noise isolating headphones.  But I'm honestly very happy with the mix of music to ambient that I get with these at the gym.

I think the single button is ingenious as well.  It hangs on the right hand cord before the two cords are joined up, so you can easily located it even if you have the rest of the cord wrapped up, routed through a jacket, etc.  At first I wasn't sure if I would like having a single button, but now I can't imagine ever needing more than one button.  This single button allows you to pause and resume music, move forward and back a track, answer and hang up calls, and EVEN activate voice commands on my Android phone (ie Ok Google).  I made a voice call with them while driving, and the other person said I was coming in loud and clear.  I just installed a new Bluetooth gadget for my car that also uses the single button approach - honestly it sounds confusing at first (like, where's the forward button ? where's  the volume button ? ) but it becomes very intuitive very quickly and is more minimal.

They also include magnets in them, so the two earbuds stick together. That's a great, thoughtful innovative feature.  It does help prevent them from tangling a bit, but I really like that I can clip them behind my head when I'm not listening to them.  Yep, they'll clip to a locker even.

The very first night I wore these to the gym they were SO comfortable, so easily forgotten that I had them in, so stable that I wore them through my entire lifting routine as well - other than the cord (which definitely gets in the way when you're lifting) the earbuds stay perfectly fit.  When stretching, if my phone ended up a little further away I could literally drag it over the floor closer to me just by dragging with my head- the buds still stayed in place.

The earbuds themselves are the type that sit outside the ear, like iPhone ear buds.  You can purchase the Yurbuds cover seperately to replace any that have worn (or to turn ""ordinary"" earbuds into Yurbuds) but they're pricey and may be able to just buy a whole new replacement headset.

They come with a little carrier bag which also has a carry loop in it, so I can clip them to my lock, although the carry loop is becoming frayed already.

Because I need long recovery periods I tend to only work out once or twice a week for several hours at a time. The Yurbuds stay firmly put and are very comfortable in my ears for hours at a time, no problem.

I would honestly have to say that these are the best earbuds/earphones I've owned.  Don't buy these to listen to fancy music. Earbuds aren't for critical listening -that's what good headphones or good monitors are for.  But if you want solid audio sound and - more importnatly - comfortable, well fitting earbuds that STAY IN PLACE than this is the one for you. I wasn't paid, didn't receive a free sample, not a gilded reviewer or anything and I don't go throwing out 5 stars all over the place ... I bought these with my own cash at a retail store and really do love them.

Full disclosure: Now that I'm already used to listening to music during my whole workout, I've purchased some bluetooth headphones as the cable can definitely become an annoyance when lifting, and sometimes I need to rest my phone away from my work area.  If those workout, these will Yurbuds be my turn-to for outdoor running, walking/hiking and around the house; anytime I want earbuds that stay put and the cable won't get in the way.  This isn't a downgrade on the Yurbuds, it's just that I do alot of different exercises and it's enough that just having a cable becomes a nuisance.",glad found running normal bud type go ear canal going crazy resetting every second definitely serious distraction hard cardio got wally world used night bought instant appreciation fidelity ear bud good enough listening mastered led zeppelin definitely heard nuance music never heard running hard die sweating gallon minute pounding like herd elephant treadmill gym pipe constant loud music good enough cover design really money using silicon natural tackiness compared rubber inserting canal put twist technique really keep running several mile sweating like pig situps sort weird yoga stretch lifting name set included two different set cover experimented larger one smaller one installed shipped fit like glove remove replace easily replace make sure shift slightly degree left oclock right one oclock take two time inserting removing get used twist lock design go quickly easily earbud hold upside put pointed end ear twist normal position locked allow ambient sound plus situational awareness sure since direct music ear found even moderate volume could hear music gym music constant pretty loud however dropping volume slightly could hear going around able find right mix music v ambient sound pretty easily one point found directly speaker large speaker probably watt turn volume home stretch room directly connected kitchen someone else banging around pot pan slamming fridge door made pretty clearly volume point coexist someone banging around pot pan im trying chill ambient music stretch probably would preferred noise isolating headphone honestly happy mix music ambient get gym think single button ingenious well hang right hand cord two cord joined easily located even rest cord wrapped routed jacket etc first sure would like single button imagine ever needing one button single button allows pause resume music move forward back track answer hang call even activate voice command android phone ie ok google made voice call driving person said coming loud clear installed new bluetooth gadget car also us single button approach honestly sound confusing first like forward button volume button becomes intuitive quickly minimal also include magnet two earbuds stick together great thoughtful innovative feature help prevent tangling bit really like clip behind head listening yep clip locker even first night wore gym comfortable easily forgotten stable wore entire lifting routine well cord definitely get way lifting earbuds stay perfectly fit stretching phone ended little away could literally drag floor closer dragging head bud still stayed place earbuds type sit outside ear like iphone ear bud purchase yurbuds cover seperately replace worn turn ordinary earbuds yurbuds pricey may able buy whole new replacement headset come little carrier bag also carry loop clip lock although carry loop becoming frayed already need long recovery period tend work twice week several hour time yurbuds stay firmly put comfortable ear hour time problem would honestly say best earbuds earphone owned buy listen fancy music earbuds critical listening good headphone good monitor want solid audio sound importnatly comfortable well fitting earbuds stay place one paid receive free sample gilded reviewer anything go throwing star place bought cash retail store really love full disclosure already used listening music whole workout purchased bluetooth headphone cable definitely become annoyance lifting sometimes need rest phone away work area workout yurbuds turn outdoor running walking hiking around house anytime want earbuds stay put cable get way downgrade yurbuds alot different exercise enough cable becomes nuisance,"01 1, 2015",A3F4OO6AEYUWNG,Mark Twain,{'Color:': ' Black'},"REALLY do stay put even when running, lifting, yoga, anything.",1420070400,False,6.0,1

7904,B01FJFNE5I,,5.0,"In recent years, I've become a big fan of Lenovo.  After having some issues with purchases of an HP, 2 Acers,and a Dell over the past 4 years, I decided to give Lenovo a chance.  The first Lenovo purchase was for two 'Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p 59388313 15.6-Inch Laptop (Dusk Black) ' laptops.  While I found them a bit more expensive than other available laptops of similar specs, I was fed up with the poor performance and/or qualty of prior brands.

It's been about 2.5 years since the purchase of the Y510p laptops.  However, my wife was still using one of the last remaining Acers (a V5 Touch) as of this purchase a little over a month ago.  She could no longer stand to use it.  It had been replaced via Squaretrade maybe 6-8 months earlier and now it too was freezing and just barely responsive at time.  So I jumped on Amazon to find her a new laptop when I stumbled across this one one sale.  It's only been a short time, but this Lenovo has performed admirably.  It is super responsive and fairly lightweight when compared to other laptops, including the the Acer V5 touch.

It provides a strong specs showing at the price point.  It was retailing on Amazon for around $600 or so, but had a sale price of around $515.  However, I think that was PrimeDay and I got it for $400.  Great deal considering the specs:

Intel i5-6200U 2.3GH
8GB RAM
1TB Harddrive
Optical DVD RW drive
HD LED 15.6"" display
High-speed 802.11 a/c
USB 3.0 port
HDMI out
Windows 10

I've played around with it while my wife was away and it is impressive.  I wish I would have picked up a second one, at that price.  So we know have 3 Lenovo laptops and they have operated perfectly.  Even the 2.5 year old Y510p still perform as they did when new (one of which is heavily used for business, streaming, and software development and testing via virtual machines).

Such conditions are not present every day in the Gulf but when they are, the imaging works and is far more informative than traditional sonar.  Included below are a video of my marina's channel, and an image from an 'artificial reef', an area with concrete rubble.  The recordings include the GPS coordinates, and allow creating waypoints while reviewing the scans at home.

1. Range: The range is short, my Nokia E71 is right in front of me on my table and I cannot get a continuous stream of music. Needless to say, leaving it in my front thigh pocket is out of the question.

2. Sound isolation: I am unable to have a snug fit to my ear. Thus there is no noise isolation. It works if you are in a car or a room. But if you are wearing it down the street, the surrounding noise will force you to set the music volume to almost the maximum.  After 10 minutes, I am suffering from noise fatigue.

3. Fit: It is not uncomfortable just extremely hard to get a good fit.

4. Battery life: Untested since I cannot use it for than a few minutes.

I read one review where someone complained they could only access via their network!  No kidding, the name of the product is NAS.  Network accessible Storage!  Others complain the speed is slow when accessing their files from the Internet.  No kidding people... maybe the internet connection you were using was SLOW.  If your have an older 100mb network ITS YOUR NETWORK THATS SLOW!  100mb network = about 10MB/second at best.  If your copying files from your wireless device MAYBE YOUR WIRELESS IS SLOW.

This is my second one I purchased as the first one is now almost full.  Disk space is disk space..... but the software that comes with this device makes it perfect for me as BOTH a backup device and a file server.

Here is a tip for anyone interested.....  I use it to back up my digital media collection of home movies, pictures, mp3's etc from multiple PC's.....if one of my PC's ever crashes, I have a copy of that data. The bonus is that I share out that backup copy and now the backup data is used as my media server for all my devices!  Such as my Smart TV, WDTV media player, MINIX Neo media player with XBMC,  Windows Media Center, my smart phone or whatever.

I'm in IT for 30 years and handled 1000's of different components and software... it's nice to open this up, plug it in get it 100% functional in 5 minutes without having to look at any documentation... the terminology used is perfectly in line with industry standards.  If it's confusing for you, then you shouldn't be buying this type of equipment.

Performs very well.... On my Gigabit network, the Read speeds are good ranging 70-90 Mbytes/second for large file copies to my PC's ( depending on the PC)  Write speeds not as fast... get about 30-40 Mbytes/second for large file copies. Obviously there are devices that would outperform this, but were talking $200 or less for this device.

For me the best features are...
- easy setup - great features - low  price
- fast Read speeds
- has a sleep mode so 100% quiet when in sleep mode
- quiet hum when it is operational ... no significant clicking when accessing data!

3052,B00HA6R1IQ,,4.0,"Well, with a great amount of trepidation, I bought this computer on 11/15/14 after reading both how slow it was AND how fast it was (based on the various conflicting reviews on the internet). I did not buy it thru Amazon, but another source.

First, out of the box, it is SLOOOOOOWWWWW! Excrutiatingly slow. This is not simply due to the windows updates as some have proposed, but to TWO things: only 4gb RAM is installed (which is SHARED with the graphics processor), and a 1TB hard drive that runs at only 5400rpm and is a SATA 2.

There is SO LITTLE RAM left after the graphics processor uses what it needs to run the HD display (which is indeed beautiful), that any programs or updates have to continually swap in and out of the remaining RAM to run - this, coupled with the relatively slow hard drive, creates a bottleneck - and a frustrating one at that.

After figuring out how to get inside the computer (you have to remove the back cover carefully by prying open the lower right corner of the cover with a VERY thin blade, and slowly unsnap it around the entire circumference of the cover, AND once inside, you have to remove a metal shield that covers the RAM slots), I added an additional 4gb of ram ($40) to max it out to 8gb, and a Samsung 250gb Solid State Drive ($99.00).

After the upgrades, and NUMEROUS windows updates, it now runs as it should. While not a speed demon, it is perfectly fine now for everyday tasks such as web surfing, email, Netflix, etc.

If you are not comfortable opening up a cleverly sealed computer to upgrade it, I would not recommend buying this. However, for those who have no problem tinkering around, you can make this a great addition to your home.

They are not bass heavy so if that is what you like, you may want to go with the Beats.  These headphones give a nice clean sound and they are very comfortable.  As a kid, I was always teased about my big ears. I was shocked at how comfortable these headphones fit over my big ears.  I use them for roughly 5 hours a day at work and have no complaints.

They are well constructed with a great rubbery/plastic feel which is hardly a problem.  They are very easy to sync with any Bluetooth device and the features to answer and end phone calls if using a cell phone works great.  The only draw back I noticed is that when I answer a call using the phone and not the headphones, the music does not restart in the headphones but comes from the phone's speaker instead.  So, it's best to use the button on the headphones to answer and end calls.  As far as distance goes, I was able to walk 27 feet away from my phone before the music began to cut out.  I'm not sure how that stacks up against other Bluetooth headphones.

I am very happy with these headphones.  I saved myself a few hundred dollars by not purchasing the higher end sets.

3150,B006QB1RPY,,5.0,I purchased a refurbished ASUS RT-N66U from DealsPro1 (fulfillment by Amazon) for $119.95 and free shipping.  When I opened the plain white box that it came in I found a RT-N66R instead of the RT-N66U.  From what I have been able to determine the R is the retail version of the U and is sold by Best Buy.  Setup was pretty straight-forward and I didn't encounter any problems getting my wireless devices working except for a Brother laser printer.  Re-installation of the printer software and re-doing the network setup for the printer corrected the problem.  I've only been using the router for a few days but judging from my limited experience I would say that this router is amazing.  Signal strength is surprisingly good.  My old router was a Linksys E2000 and I was having signal strength issues on my Sony home entertainment setup using the proprietary Sony network adapter.  Signal strength was 52% at best with the Linksys router.  After I installed the ASUS RT-N66R the signal strength shot up to 100%.  Amazing.  No more problems streaming movies.  Signal strength on my notebook and tablet is at least 4 (out of 5) bars anywhere in my house and garage.

All the holes line up appropriately.  When the case is in the upright position it is very stable. I have had some issues with the tab slipping out in the other position though.

Cons: the magnet doesn't always work maybe because there is a little looseness in the case that prevents it from aligning at the edges. That means I sometimes have to give the case a little nudge to align the magnet properly. Not a huge deal.

As seen below I specifically asked about this feature before buying!  The manual describes, what everyone else calls, Commercial Skip on pages 12 & 24.  There is no set up option for
Commercial Scan as there is in my ProScan VCR.  What the hell is going on! Why am I being told one thing by your representatives and I get the unit it doesn't even have the feature?  If this unit indeed has no Commercial Scan I will be
alerting Consumer Groups like the BBB because all the advertising and marketing of this product is false.  Manuel Calcagno
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------Response
from RCA about Commercial Advance before Purchase: Dear Customer:  Thank
you for your inquiry on your product.  During tape playback, the
""Commercial Advance"" feature allows you to avoid watching most
commercials on any recording over 15 minutes long. After the VCR
finishes recording, the Commercial Advance system locates and
electronically marks most of the commercial segments. When the recording
is played back, the VCR scans or fast forwards through the marked
segments. Either a blue screen or the fast motion video of the
commercial itself can be displayed while commercials are being advanced
through.  Commercial Advance reduces three minutes of commercial time to
approximately ten seconds (SLP mode) of fast forwarding time.  We
received your inquiry and appreciate your interest in our line of
products.  Thomson products are normally available from most mass
merchants or discount stores, catalog showrooms, department stores, and
drug, hardware, and variety stores. Please consult your Yellow Pages, or
call 1-580-634-0123 for dealers in your area. Retail pricing information
can also be obtained from your local dealers. We do not establish prices

Feature Definitions and their Use -- Not Applicab le --  Rikki  Thanks
for the response.  My main question was to verify that this RCA Unit,
has  Commercial Scan/Advance  which automatically bypasses commercials
on playback as opposed  to  Commercial Skip in which a button has to be
manually pressed for  each  30-60 seconds.  I do not want the latter.
Does RCA also sell ProScan VCR's? If so, where are they  available?
They are very difficult to locate. I have an old ProScan with
Commercial  Scan which I really liked.  Thanks  Manuel Calcagno  In a

This sub arrived as scheduled. Initially, I was very excited to hook this sub up. The sub is only 150 RMS and 300 watt max but since it is a Kicker product, my expectations were high. I read tons of reviews saying how this is ""the best subwoofer for the price.. period"" and ""Kicks so  hard for the wattage"". Well, maybe.

I'm currently running an 800 watt Visonik Bridgable amp. I will tell you this, this kicker can hit hard, but cannot preform good low bass notes and deep bass. Its really not loud at all. I purchased it thinking it would atleast shake my small car a little (i have a 1993 Chrysler Lebaron) and it hardly does anything. Now i'm not expecting these to be Kicker l7 material or bust my windows out... But Its dissapointing for a kicker product.

I'm asking that you take my word for it because a few reasons. I'm not an amateur nooby car audio kid. I've had a few speakers in my day and i know how to set systems up pretty well. I'm just saying right now, PLEASE LISTEN. If you are looking for your first subwoofer for a small car, then go ahead and by one. Hell maybe two. But if you were like me looking for the short way out of some cheap 12 inch kickers to rattle your car, save yourself the money and purchase a better model or different brand.

First of all, the packaging was extremely nice.
Then, I found out there is very little bloatware coming with this MSI laptop, so cleaning before use was a breeze.
I find the plastic color and feel of this laptop to be very agreeable.
The keyboard is practicable and pleasing to the touch.
Now for the hardware.
The sound coming out of its 2 front mounted speakers is powerful, but I had nothing in the past to refer to, so I can not comment on its validity as a gaming machine.
IT IS SUPER FAST. On my last laptop, one of my editing software took 180 minutes (3hr) to render. The GP60 does it 10x faster. I almost fail out of my chair when it completed the job in only 15 minutes.
DVD and sd card slot worked as expected.

How to prevent it from turning itself off: Set your input device up hight close to or at max, set the Speaker to middle volume.

It was really easy to use, performance was lightning quick and the zoom lens on digital SLR feels so natural.  I can take pictures pretty much as fast as I can press the shutter which is really great.  I shot mostly in Auto or Potrait mode and the picture quality especially of potraits were breath-taking.  People's skin and complexion were exceptionally sharp, soft and natural looking not washed out like my other point-and-shoot camera.  And I absolutely love the wide angle composition that I was able to get from my 18-70mm lens so I get the people and the landscape at the same time.

5102,B00BTVTA0U,,4.0,"I ordered one of these from a vendor on Amazon, and the product came with scratches on the screen, which I could live with.  What I could not live with, though, is that the video would tend to freeze when a file was playing back, after about 30 seconds or so into it.  This was true whether I chose five-minute or two-minute recordings, and occurred on two different micro cards (16Gb and 32GB), thus the unit itself was clearly at fault.  So, I sent that one back.

I ordered a second one from eBestrade, and it seems to work okay.  This time the screen came with a protective cover that I peeled off, and the unit records and plays back without issue. The only negative, as a few other reviews have noted, is that the back camera recordings are inverted, meaning it's like you're viewing the video image from a mirror.  Street signs read backwards, and it looks like you're driving in England...everything is reversed.  Apparently they all have this defect.

Interestingly, you'll notice that this same design is sold by quite a few vendors at different prices, some shipped from the US, some shipped from the US with Amazon Prime as an option, and some shipped from China or Hong Kong. From what I can tell, though, they all have the same features. The first one I purchased was packaged in a completely different box than the second, but other than that they both had exactly the same functionality.

I chose this particular design because it is the only one I found with a detachable, wired rear camera.  Many accidents are caused by being hit from behind, so I didn't want a dash cam that only recorded what was going on in the front of my vehicle.

The unit records into two files, one for the front camera and one for the rear.  It will take up to a 32GB micro SD card.  I have a 16GB in mine, which is easily sufficient because it loop records, meaning it will start to record over the older files once the card fills up.  With my 40-mile round trip to work, I can record several days worth of driving before it starts to record over the older files.

I have found the picture quality from both cameras, front and rear, to be adequate.  You will NOT be able to read license plates from either camera...definitely not from the back camera (it would be inverted anyway), and not from the front camera either, unless conditions are absolutely perfect (vehicle stopped, close, and very bright lighting).  So, if someone side-swipes you and takes off, you'll get video of the car speeding away, but that will be about it.

On the other hand, though, if some idiot cuts you off, or plows into you from behind, and an accident does unfortunately occur, you'll have very good footage of what took place.

The unit is very small and very light.  So small, I have to get a magnifying glass to read the menu choices on the screen.  The settings for it are many...you can pretty much tweak it to do whatever you want it to do.  You will, though, need to play around with the buttons to figure out how to find, select and save your choices.  The written instructions are pretty bad (mine came in both English and Chinese), so learning through trial and error is really the best way.

It seems to work fine for what it is made for. Don't expect a solid, well-built, name-brand Sony or Samsung type product.  This is a low-cost, Chinese manufactured device.  Both of the units I bought came with English menus already activated.  It mounts securely to the windshield, and is not at all noticeable when you're driving if you place it strategically.  Also note that even though the wire connecting the rear camera is really long, to get the wire hidden away in my SUV (an Armada), I am going to need to get an extension cable.  I don't think this will be necessary in most cars, though.

The unit will power on and off with the vehicle as long as you have it plugged into a 12-volt socket that also powers on and off with the vehicle. Some of the sockets in my SUV are constantly on, so I have purchased a splitter (this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Multi-Use-Vehicle-Charger-with-Dual-USB-Ports-and-Dual-12-Volt-Sockets-Magnadyne/dp/B000PB8CQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Multi-Use Vehicle Charger with Dual USB Ports and Dual 12 Volt Sockets - Magnadyne</a>) to accommodate it, since I also have an external GPS unit that also needs to power on and off with the vehicle.  The dash cam stays on for about 15 seconds after the ignition is switched off.

Considering all of the above, for what you get for $70 (as of this writing), I consider this dash cam a four-star deal.

2140,B00505F01E,,5.0,"After getting better speakers (Def Tech 8060ST system), I spent a considerable amount of time tinkering with my Denon 2112ci settings. I became disappointed with the Denon because it made the highs too shrill with its ""HIFI"" processing and felt underpowered. It seemed to encourage crisp clear sound and my hears found it unbalanced and unnatural. Strangely enough, I chose the Denon over other brands about a year ago because I felt it made my Pioneer speakers sound better.

I saw the 809 going for $410 on Amazon, so I jumped on it (paid $420 for the Denon 2112ci). Short story is the Onkyo is better hardware and sounds better. I am comparing apples to oranges though... the Onkyo 809 is in the same tier as the Denon 3112 (not the 2112), but the Onkyo same tier receivers are always cheaper than the Denons, where you can always get a higher tier Onkyo instead of a lower tier Denon. If you have cheaper speakers, you might be okay with a cheaper receiver (in fact, it might work better for you), but better speakers demand a better receiver.

The 809 is loaded with inputs, outputs, and features. It literally has everything you can think of. Preouts, second video output, saved settings per input, wide or height speakers, zone 2, and so on. The back of the receiver has over 3 times as many connections as the Denon (the Onkyo is a few inches higher and 2 times heavier).

The sound is very refined and high-end without the ""HIFI."" If you turn the volume up, you hardly get that pink audio noise, which was really loud on the Denon. Compared to the Denon, it has more refined sound - there are more details heard without jacking up the highs. The Onkyo has ""warmer"" sound than Denon, but is still dynamic, while the Denon has an ""overdrive"" sound.

The GUI is much better than the Denon's, but could still use some work. A nice feature is you are able to run the Auto Setup Calibration and then still change the EQ settings. Most receivers only allow manual or auto configuration. Audyssey XT works well. There is a newer release of the unit that has Audyssey XT32, but I felt that wasn't necessary for another $250.

Speakers play a more important part in sound and you need a receiver that goes well with them.

8311,B0010LPBRK,,5.0,"My review on my largest memory purchase for my digital camera, the A-DATA 16GB Turbo SDHC Class 6 Memory Card.  With this 16 GB memory card, it is possible for me to take almost 9000 pictures at the best resolution for an eight megapixel Canon digital camera.  But my primary purpose of buying this large memory, is so I can record up to several hours of video on my digital camera. For that purpose, this fast memory card serves extremely well for that task. I had no problems using this memory on my digital camera so far.  The speed of this memory card is greater than the capability of my camera when it comes to recording as well is playing back the videos.  With this large memory, it is possible for me to use my digital camera like a camcorder on a trip providing the battery holds out.

When buying memory for your camera, be sure to do some research making sure you camera can handle the given memory size and type.  Me for instance, my camera is capable of handing a SDHC SD card up to 16 GB maximum.  Also if you want to use your card reader if you have one, be sure that can handle a card of this size as well. It appears, large memory cards of all varieties are getting cheaper and cheaper. I was able to use my USB card reader with this card connected to my computer to offload the videos. The specifications on my card reader did not indicated it was capable of reading a SDHC one. This apparently also hold true for my 7 inch digital picture frame as well. It apparently worked there as well. Also, with that device there was no indication on the specifications that it would work. If that didn't work, that would have been no problem for me.  I could just simply connected my camera to my computer's USB port instead. Using this card reader, I ran a speed tests on this memory.  The result was close to 19 MB per second in terms of read speed.  Using this memory card this way with my card reader, transform it to a 16 GB portable hard drive or like a jump drive if I wish.

I would like to add that with most devices this 16 GB SDHC card would more than likely work if your device is less than a year or 2 old. This will be true whether the device's specifications indicated so or not. The best options are: 1.  If possible to borrow one from a friend to try out on your device.  2.

2047,B0063B3JFS,,1.0,"I purchased a Tenba Mini Messenger bag a few months ago which recently developed a quality problem. I contacted Tenba who were very nice and offered to replace it with their new Discovery Messenger, which they assured me was a better bag. Boy, were they wrong.

That being said, my Nikon D5100, 2 lenses and a charger will barely fit in the bag and leaves no space for anything else.

One of the things I thought would be great about this bag is that they included a rain cover. Unfortunately, rather than creating an out of the way zipper pocket for it, it simply sits loose wherever you can find a space. And it's bulky. Very poorly thought out.

I've installed various other screens on my other PDA's.  This product is unlike some of the other screen protectors as it requires the spray that comes with the product.

As I usually do, I turned the shower on to knock out the dust in the air, washed my hands and wiped the screen with the lint free cloth provided with the kit.  I then removed the screen from the sheet and sprayed it down on the contact side with the spray bottle provided.

After completing the process, I couldn't wait and turned on my Ipad sooner than recommended.  As the product hadn't fully dried, there was a slight rainbow effect.

3714,B0009204RI,,4.0,"Pros: Solid build quality, useful features, easy programming, good range, good false alert filtering, voice alerts, Ku band (for European drivers)

Cons: Volume could be louder, no rear-facing radar antenna or arrows, mode does not automatically switch to multi-threat display upon multiple radar encounters, not immune to all RDDs

Overall, this is an excellent radar detector. It looks great in my windshield (I drive a '98 Honda Civic with a hardwire kit), and the suction cups work well. It has three modes: City, Autoscan, and Highway. I mainly use Autoscan and Highway. The false alert filtering is so good that I rarely use City mode. It is easy to program and to turn off certain bands. There are also four brightness settings, which make it easy to adjust according to light conditions. The detection range is excellent, especially in Upstate New York, where the police are too stupid to use instant-on and I can detect them from a mile away.

Now for the negatives. With wind noise at highway speeds and the radio on, it is sometimes hard to hear, even at full volume. I wish that the speaker was just a little bit louder. There are also no arrows or rearward-facing radar antennae, such as in the Valentine One. During highway cruising, this leaves me guessing whether the cop is ahead of me or behind. I usually just slow down and wait to see if I pass him or if he passes me, and then speed back up again once I identify the threat and see that it is safe. Another thing that I do not understand is the multi-threat display. When multi-threat display is activated, it shows the band and signal strength of each threat, simultaneously. This is very useful when there are two or more police radar threats in the area or when there is one real threat and one false alert (from an automatic door opener, for example). This works even better than the V1 ""Bogey Counter,"" because it shows the signal strength of each individual threat, instead of just flashing the number of threats and the signal strength of the strongest one. In most situations, when there is only one threat to pay attention to, the normal display is much easier to read with signal strength bars, much like a cell phone battery meter. It would be ideal if the normal mode could be used at all times, and the detector could automatically switch to multi-threat display upon encountering multiple threats. Instead, the detector remains locked in one mode, and does not change unless it is programmed. This means that if normal mode is activated (this is what what most drivers want), it stays in normal mode and only displays one threat at a time, ignoring the other, even when there are two or more simultaneous threats. This leaves the driver with an annoying decision to make : leave the detector in multi-threat display mode and have less easy-to-read warnings, or leave it in normal mode and not know when there is more than one threat to be aware of.

All in all, this is a great detector. I have never used a Valentine One, but from what I have read and researched, this is the better detector for most drivers, due to the better ergonomics, ease of use, cheaper price, voice alerts, and reduced false alarms. Don't hook up this Beltronics (or any other detector) to your windshield and expect to be exempt from speeding tickets. Rather, learn how radar detectors work and how to use them, and understand their weaknesses and blind spots. LIDAR (police laser) is becoming more and more widely used, and laser jammers are essential for anyone seeking adequate protection from speed traps. Although radar detectors can detect laser, they are useless as a form of protection. Radar can be detected long before the officer can read your speed, but by the time your detector alerts you of laser, the officer already has your speed. As far as radar detection goes, the Rx65 does an excellent job and I highly recommend it. If you are a trucker or if you live in Virginia, Washington DC, or Canada, remember to get the Bel STi, because the Rx65 is not immune to all RDDs (radar detector detectors)

6743,B000EUGX70,,4.0,"Got this unit with a LCD TV purchase with huge (humongous) discount, so I though, what the heck, I'll give it a shot. First steps were discouraging, although setup is easy, device connects well via USB and connection to Logitech is smooth. Problems started after that, as I was adding more and more components and Harmony's auto setup steps failed to configure everything properly, but in part due to some of my errors and a few small details I overlooked.

Setting up components is fairly simple and Logitech's database does most of the work for you. It is, however, EXTREMELY important to understand how ""Activities"" function works and how it needs to be configured. This is the core of Harmony's ""brain"" and if you fail there, you'll be quite disappointed with it, like so many negative reviews here suggest.

To make a long story short, after a couple of days playing with the device I love it! Once you fully understand how to set it up and tweak it, it's absolutely great. Have all my AV in the house on this single unit, some nine or ten of them and all work great. Even some older components, including some old DVD player, another not so common brand and somewhat old cable box (actually, both of my cable boxes are not that new, just about to upgrade to HD-DVR, so I was pleasantly surprised that Harmony ""recognized"" them without any problem).

I yet have to experiment and use this remote more. Didn't give it five stars just because of occasional goofy behavior, but certainly nothing too bad, worrisome or too annoying.

People who gave one star reviews to this toy probably got frustrated right in the beginning and/or failed to understand and follow ALL instructions very carefully. Given an amazing number of supported components, both old and new, I find it hard to believe that customers could not make them work properly. I suspect human error in majority of cases. Once you set up Harmony properly and start using it, you'll see how convenient and even intuitive it is. Nice design, too. I was thinking about getting another one, but most of the components it controls are in a single room that I use 80% of the time. When I want to use others in other rooms, I just take Harmony with me. Fortunately, other family members haven't gotten hooked to it yet so they don't care. Once they do, I'll have no choice but to buy another one.

1140,B005JXADTG,,4.0,"This Philips waterproof pocket camcorder works well as video camera underwater, at the beach, in snow, and in rain -- anything that the elements will throw at it -- but as a standalone, everyday camera, you can probably do better.

The camera feels great in the hand, especially with the rubberized strip around the outside to provide a solid grip, even with wet hands.  The dark cherry housing is distinctive without being flashy.  The non-removable battery charges through a USB cable with a camera-attachment end (not a standard connection but one that I have for another camera, so it's not proprietary), and it charges fairly quickly.  The controls are mostly intuitive and easy-to-use, although, due to the waterproof housing, the buttons are not sensitive and must be pressed firmly.  Philips has included a flash, something you don't often see in pocket camcorders, let alone waterproof ones.  This works great for low-light interior and underwater video, although its range isn't far and you'll find that people may be reluctant to look at the camera.  The camera offers a one-touch button to switch between video and still camera.

The camera shoots in full 1080p video and 8MP stills, but here is where the camera falters.  The resolution of images doesn't matter if the optics, focus, and firmware are not top-rate, and unfortunately, especially with still shots, the Philips doesn't always deliver high-quality images.  My iPhone takes better stills than this camera does, primarily because the Philips requires you to firmly press a button in the center of the camera, and it almost impossible to hold it still.  I got more blurry stills than good shots.  The HD video is comparable to other pocket HD camcorders.  The zoom is awful -- sluggish and without the same sharp video you get without it.  The sound is comparable to others such as the Flip, but you need to hold the camera at the bottom to avoid covering the microphone slots near the lens.

The camera uses micro SD cards, and one is NOT included in the package, a real pain.  I had to order&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AmazonBasics-8-GB-microSDHC-Class-10-Flash-Memory-Card-with-SD-Adapter/dp/B0058GH450/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AmazonBasics 8 GB microSDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card with SD Adapter</a>&nbsp;before I could film more than 10 seconds.  Because Flip cameras have internal memory and Kodak cameras include memory cards, I was quite shocked to discover that the camera was unusable without this additional purchase.  The meager internal memory is used for a feature that records a few seconds prior to your pushing the button; I guess it constantly writes over images when it is turned on.

Mac Users:  the software on the camera does not work with the Mac OS, although iPhoto imports the video with no problem.  Usually, the programs that comes with cameras like this aren't all that great, so I doubt I'm missing anything.

If you want an outdoor camera in all-weather conditions and to use underwater, the Philips is a good option.  You might also want to compare to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kodak-PlaySport-Zx3-HD-Waterproof-Pocket-Video-Camera/dp/B0030MITDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kodak PlaySport (Zx3) HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera</a>, another good but not perfect option.

20,B002COJEOU,,3.0,"This is a pretty cool router - not only wireless connectivity but also with a hard drive (which is *not* included, please note!) that can be shared for storage and USB ports for sharing other devices.  It also has the picture frame feature which is kind of a nice (if a bit odd) addition.  But unfortunately, it's not exactly plug & play.

I'm not an IT guy but I got my MBA with an emphasis in Information Systems and I've handled the IT needs for small companies I've worked for (outsourcing the tougher stuff), but all that's been a few years ago and I really haven't needed to keep up on technology much since then.  So, while I'm not an expert I probably know just enough to get myself into trouble.  I've installed other wireless home routers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Link-DIR-825-Xtreme-N-Dual-Band/dp/B001F7HLRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D-Link DIR-825 Xtreme N Dual Band</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Linksys-WRT54G/dp/B00007KDVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Linksys WRT54G</a>) and they were almost plug & play.  Unfortunately, this one didn't go as smoothly.

We have broadband access through our cable provider and it was difficult to get this router to work with it, but working through the setup process on the computer solved the initial connectivity problems.  The picture frame is a nice extra feature, but the screen is so small that it seems almost pointless.  The FrameChannel option makes good use of it, though, and you can subscribe to weather, news, comics, etc., as well as have your own photos cycling.  The weather and photos were the only really worthwhile options to me, however, as the comics I selected ended up so small they couldn't be read and the news wasn't local (tons of options but nothing relevant to me).  But at least it allows you to keep the router on top of the desk or otherwise out in the open, although it didn't have as good of range as we had before (we placed the other routers *under* the desk and still got much better range).

My biggest complaint is with staying connected to the internet.  We continually had problems both on the desktop computer connected directly to the router as well as connecting wirelessly with the laptop - and sometimes one would work and the other wouldn't.  The internet would randomly drop off and later come back online, and the speed on the wireless connection was inconsistent - usually extremely fast but sometimes excruciatingly slow.

7708,B001HBH1B2,,3.0,"I am not super-thrilled with the buttkicker.  Set-up was difficult because the instructions are not as clear as they should be and are very different from the instructions given on the buttkicker website.  A simple parts list is not included.  Setting it up underneath the couch was fairly painless, but getting the amplifier to get a signal from the processor would not occur unless it was hard-wired.  The wireless set-up would not work.  The red light flashed but would not go out after 10 seconds.  It should have worked, the processor was definitely sending a signal.

Wireless problems:

1.) Instructions with unit said there did not need to be a ""line of sight"" between the transmitter and the receiver, but the instructions on the website said there had to be a direct line of sight between them.

2.)  The website instructions talked about adjusting the ""potentiometer"" on the back of the transmitter, but there is no potentiometer on the back of it to adjust.

3.)  The website offered very little in the way of trouble-shooting this problem.  I will have to call them directly tomorrow to try and resolve this problem.

As far as the ""buttkicking"" goes, we (husband and myself) did not find it a particularly wonderful addition to the home-theater experience.  We put in ""Polar Express"" to test it out and found that it was interesting, but not something we could not live without while watching movies.  It was literally the same experience we had when watching the movie, ""Earthquake"" in the 70's.  The couch and floor vibrated on varying levels depending upon the intensity of what was happening in the movie, and loud low frequencies were heard, but I guess we might have been expecting too much.  When the train in Polar Express was powering up, the shaking and low frequencies were tremendous, but did not necessarily course through our bodies like others have written about.

I think the buttkicking experience would have been much better if we were able to mount it in the center of our couch instead of at one end. Our couch does not have center support leg so we had to place the buttkicker on one far end of it.  Much of the vibration was wasted by going away from the couch.  Possibly ""buttkicker"" could have included an inexpensive substitute adapter in order to place it in the center of couches that don't have a center support.  That would have been great.

We will continue to work on the wireless problem, and if we are able to fix it, that will increase our happiness with the buttkicker.  Otherwise, we will still use the buttkicker, but not as often as we would if it worked wirelessly.  Having to manually connect the amplifier to the processor via wiring every time we want to watch a movie is a pain in the.......butt.",super thrilled buttkicker set difficult instruction clear different instruction given buttkicker website simple part list included setting underneath couch fairly painless getting amplifier get signal processor would occur unless hard wired wireless set would work red light flashed would go second worked processor definitely sending signal wireless problem instruction unit said need line sight transmitter receiver instruction website said direct line sight website instruction talked adjusting potentiometer back transmitter potentiometer back adjust website offered little way trouble shooting problem call directly tomorrow try resolve problem far buttkicking go husband find particularly wonderful addition home theater experience put polar express test found interesting something could live without watching movie literally experience watching movie earthquake couch floor vibrated varying level depending upon intensity happening movie loud low frequency heard guess might expecting much train polar express powering shaking low frequency tremendous necessarily course body like others written think buttkicking experience would much better able mount center couch instead one end couch center support leg place buttkicker one far end much vibration wasted going away couch possibly buttkicker could included inexpensive substitute adapter order place center couch center support would great continue work wireless problem able fix increase happiness buttkicker otherwise still use buttkicker often would worked wirelessly manually connect amplifier processor via wiring every time want watch movie pain butt,"03 29, 2009",A2VH0UT5EQFB6P,loveguitar,,ButtKicker BKA300 Wireless???,1238284800,False,,0
5282,B00006JQ6C,,5.0,"Pay attention here. These are very good for some people, but not for everyone. The Quick connect is a great alternative universal mount for anyone looking to standardize one or more cameras to multiple platforms. If you're looking to swap from a tripod to a mono pod to a cable cam to a jib to a shoulder rig to a steady cam or whatever - then this is for you. It will work, even with heavier cameras as the Sony NEX-VG20, but caution should be used in high stress/vibration situations.  I don't recommend this for lens-heavy set ups.  The base/mounting puck is about 7/8"" high and about 2.5"" diameter. The square camera plate is about 1 3/8"" square at it's widest and 1/4"" high. The benefit of the square plate is that the camera can be oriented in a North, South, East, West configuration on a tripod, etc. simply by releasing the lock, lifting the camera and remounting where you need it.

If you're looking to standardize mounts on super-expensive cameras, then look for a more expensive universal mount.

Please not that these tweeters are almost 3 inches deep. So way before you attempt to cut any holes in your car.

You can plan way ahead and find that perfect spot by planning ahead with your wood or your measurements way before you cut your hole. Also note that the hole cut out diameter is correct for the speaker. But the Terminals on the tweeters stick out farther than the cutout diameter. So when you pick out your perfect spot to place these speakers. You will have to trim out about a 1/4 inch more out at only where the terminals protrude from. I would suggest just getting a drill bit that is a hair wider than the terminals and just grind out the 1/4 inch worth of space to get these speakers to go flush.

It's a bit confusing to switch from mono to stereo, presets, that kind of stuff but you get the hang of it. Sound quality is good, not flawless it does cut out sometimes.

My two biggest problems with this transmitter, and reasons why I had to change my review. One, the transmitter goes from 88.1 to 107.x... I live in Wisconsin, we don't have a whole lot of stations compared to some places, so I can't imagine this thing would work as well for people in say, Chicago, or Milwaukee, or some place more urban than where I am.

Second, and a little more worrying, where the thing plugged into my ipod, the rubber coating came loose from the plug making some of the wires exposed. This I did not like, I tossed it the day I noticed it because the last thing I wanted was a potential fire hazard. And for anybody that thing I stretched the cord too far or something like that. No. Most of the time I had it in a little spot about a foot infront of the plug (think 04+ Pontiac Grand Prix, little spot infront of shifter, with it plugged in right behind shifter). So there's no way I was stretched the cord, bending the cord or anything like it shouldn't have been. So, I'm not sure what the problem was, but I expected this item to last more than 4 or 5 months.",previously review deleted make one transmitter horrible hence star better bit confusing switch mono stereo presets kind stuff get hang sound quality good flawless cut sometimes two biggest problem transmitter reason change review one transmitter go x live wisconsin whole lot station compared place imagine thing would work well people say chicago milwaukee place urban second little worrying thing plugged ipod rubber coating came loose plug making wire exposed like tossed day noticed last thing wanted potential fire hazard anybody thing stretched cord far something like time little spot foot infront plug think pontiac grand prix little spot infront shifter plugged right behind shifter way stretched cord bending cord anything like sure problem expected item last month,"07 22, 2010",A102SVOH0JD2RP,jaaaa,,Was great.. now,1279756800,True,,0

9622,B001SER460,,5.0,"This point and shoot isn't compact as others, but it is water proof and it takes good photos under water. The key is to use the underwater mode so the white balance is decent. Unfortunately, the video resolution is limited and there is no underwater video mode, so the underwater video comes out very blue. It may be possible to fix this in post processing, but I don't think most tools like iMovie make it easy to fix this. The other super annoying ""feature"" is that the flash switches back to ""auto"" ever time you turn the camera on. A flash in slightly murky water leads to an interesting-only-in-the-first-shot twinkling star effect. All the bits of junk floating in the water reflect the light of the flash and you get lots of burned out tiny spots instead of murky water.

I bought two of these (one for my wife and one for myself) before we left for Hawaii. I originally looked in to a case for my DSLR, but those were well over $1000. For significantly less than that, I was able to purchase two of these cameras and my wife and I both got to take oodles of photos of fish, rays, eels, turtles and even a seal.

 We are planning another roadtrip and it was very easy to transfer all of the places and routes that we want to ride from the laptop (from Mapquest.com) to the GPS. I think that is a fantastic feature!
 One other con, is that there is quite a bit of glare off the screen on a sunny day, even in the car making it a little frustrating to follow directions.
 I do not look forward to up-dating the unit as it takes hours and slows down everything in the house that used the internet, but it is free, so I tolerate it.

It has a good Aux plug in, right in the front.  And the SD/USB inputs are a great bonus.  I picked up a 4GB card and filled it with old favorites.  It even recognizes folders, so you can put whole albums in their own folders and play each one separately.

The only real downside I've seen with this is the power input.  If you hook it up to a switched power line, you lose the clock every time you turn off the car (oddly, not the position on the SD card, though).  Or, if you plug it into a full time power line, you have to turn the radio off each time or risk draining the battery.  I went for the switched line.

8916,B000A6LSVY,,5.0,"Let me preface this review by stating that I've been a fan of Microsoft hardware (primarily mice & keyboards) for some time now.  I'm not die-hard a MS fan by any means (heck I prefer Unix over Windows for most uses), but I have to admit they've done a decent job at making computer hardware.  I especially like their ergonomic keyboards and optical mice.  I know many people prefer Logitech's products, but I'm not a gamer, so Microsoft's input devices suit me just fine.

I thought I bought the holy grail of mice when I upgraded to the Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 about a year ago, so much so that I got the notebook version for my laptop not long after.  So I was skeptical about the level of improvement on these new-fangled laser mice, and hadn't planned on buying one.

However, I never really cared for the snap-in receiver on my Wireless Notebook Mouse 3000.  It is designed to be adjustable so that the end of the receiver can be repositioned to different angles for the best wireless reception.  Unfortunately, this design also makes the receiver come loose easily when stored in the bottom of the mouse, causing it to turn on frequently while not in use--draining battery life.  So I decided to give the MS Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000 a try, as it comes with a fixed receiver that doesn't move.

I was blown away by how much better the laser notebook mouse tracks.  It is surprisingly more precise and accurate than the previous mouse devices.  It's hard to understand the improvement until you've tried one.  The mouse is extremely responsive, and makes other non-laser mice feel like heavy paperweights in comparison.  The laser is not just a gimmicky marketing trick, it really makes for a better mouse!  I subsequently bought the Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 for my desktop, and am experiencing the same level of improvement there as well.  It feels terrific in my hand, and I like the fact that it can also run on one AA battery (like other MS wireless mice I've used) for a reduced weight.

The only drawback is that the laser is invisible, as I miss the red light on the bottom of my old mouse sometimes (but not enough to go back to the old mouse!).  Also, I would rather have a black receiver than the more standout silver color.  I experimented and found that the laser mouse will work with the black wireless receiver for the Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0, but scrolling doesn't work as well, so I'm sticking with the silver receiver.

I was a little leary in purchasing another Lacie device, but their customer support is very good and I know their products are usually very good.

This newer model is substantially improved.  First, it no longer has a fan to cool it (which I think was unnecessary before anyway).  The inside only consists of a hard drive and a small circuit board.  It is completely sealed and just uses the outside aluminum case for cooler (which hardly gets warm).  This model also runs much quieter than the previous one.  The software that it runs (linux based) is much more improved as well.  The web interface is easier to use and you can also control more things, like turning off the blue light on the front and letting it go into sleep mode at specified times to save money.

Also, I am able to stream photos and listen to music from my DirecTV box with this.  The previous model had this same capability, but never worked right and would constantly hang.  This one works flawlessly and is easy to setup. I really like this, as you can show guests pictures right on your TV. It comes in handy.

(1 Pack) iPad 2 / 3 / 4 Screen Protector, Etrech 9H Hardness 0.26mm HD Tempered Glass for iPad 2 / iPad 3 / iPad 4

The ipad screen protect is very easy to place over my ipad 3. Took me 3 tries to get it aligned to my liking. Even came with two home button sticker (aka pimples. One white, one black). I didn't use the pimple.

Came with all the stuff need to clean your ipad screen prior to putting on the screen protector. Cleaning cloth is too small in my opinion, so I used the one I got from the optometrist. Makes it a lot easier to clean.

Pros:
- Fits like a glove.
- Provide all materials needed to clean your ipad
- Easy to apply. no bubbles when I applied
- Does not scratch screen when keyed, or finger nailed.
- Can read pdf's out in the sun

Cons:
- The surface of the screen protector had some sticky-ish stuff on the surface. Can be wiped after installation, but don't know why it there in the first place

Tip: Start from the home button. Slowly lower screen protector from home button side. Check alignment for at until 30% coverage. If alignment is correct just let go and screen protector will fall into place. If alignment is not correct, pull back up slowly and align again. Rinse and repeat till you get it right.

Tip 2: Pealing off the initial sticky layer may create static electricity. Place a piece of metal by work area. Touch clean metal after pealing sticky layer may help to remove static electricity so your hand doesn't attract dust in the air.

Disclaimer:
I have received this product at a discounted price or free to provide an honest review.

Edit: July 30
Seems the sticky layer was probably a manufacture issue. Etrech replied quickly to emails about the issue and resolved them promptly. A+ to their customer service.

Nikon makes this lens 50mm f/1.8 in both D and G versions. Upgrading to a G is pointless if you ask me all it does is make an already light weight lens even more lighter.

The only complaint I have is that the stylus support is suspect compared to the Wacom support you would find on a Samsung Note II or III for example.  The response is uneven and there are marks that appear when you lift up your pen.  There have been some software updates that have improved the situation, and I've yet to try the new stylus design.
