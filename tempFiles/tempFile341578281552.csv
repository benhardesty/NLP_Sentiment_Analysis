I have a long history with this product, going back to its days as Ulead's video editor. It was flaky then, stayed flaky in the occasional upgrade I've purchased and remains flaky in this most recent version.

  I needed an inexpensive video editor for another computer and I am up to my license limit on the other packages I own and my earlier VideoStudio packages are not Windows 7 compatible. This is certainly cheap enough, but true to its own traditions, it is not ready for prime time.

  For example, I tried to open two MP4 files created with the ArcSoft video product. Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 gave me a file mismatch error. However, Apple QuickTime, Avid Studio, Adobe Premiere Pro, Cyberlink PowerDirector 10, Avif Pinnacle 14 HD and Windows Movie Maker opened the MP4 files without difficulty. I noted in Corel's support forum that there are many reported problems identical or closely similar to mine. To me, that means sloppy coding and inadequate beta-testing and quality control, the same problems that have plagued Ulead/Corel problems for years. Oddly enough, Video studio Pro X4 would open other MP4 files created with the ArcSoft product.

  Next, I wanted to record from a DV source. Video Studio Pro X4 recognized the source, played the audio but would not display a preview of the video. I finally got it to work, but don't ask me how. The problem occurred on numerous occasion making VideoStudio very difficult to record with.

  I don't know what other unpleasant surprises are in store for me with Corel Video studio Pro X4, but based on past experience, there will be no shortage of them. On the other hand, the product is cheap - in more than just price - and this particular need doesn't require much more than the minimal capabilities.

  Overall, my initial impressions are negative. Should further experience change my opinion, I will amend my review. My advice though is that unless you absolutely can't afford a better video editing product, avoid Corel Video Studio Pro X4.

  I continued working with VideoStudio for another day and my impression has now solidified: it stinks.

  Repeated difficulties connecting to a known good DV device. Crashes so severely that the Windows 7 computer it was hosted on required a reboot. Usability is low with basic editing commands buried deep in the manual. Single frame key shortcuts, for example, are buried in the manual instead of in tooltips.

  My opinion: Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 is to be avoided.

H.,"In the past fifteen years or so, I've had experience with Norton, McAfee, ZoneLabs, and Kaspersky anti-virus and security software.  Bitdefender ranks right up there among the least problematic security suites I've come across.

I've had McAfee products that brought my computer to its knees and ZoneLabs products that interfered terribly with Internet browsing.  I haven't noticed any glitches so far with Bitdefender 2010.  It's the most transparent suite I've used.

I installed this software on a Pentium 4 HT with 2gb RAM that runs WinXP Pro.  Firefox still clips along, and the antivirus engine does a pretty quick job of working through the nearly 400gbs of files I've got on the 500gb hard drive.

There are many customizable options in the Bitdefender interface.  None of it is confusing, but there are a lot of options.  The software operates simply, though.  It doesn't throw numerous alerts at you every time you do something on the PC.  It knows which new programs to trust (whitelisting?) and allows them access through the firewall.  I haven't had a problem with malware on this machine.  It seems to be doing just fine.

In all, this is a worthy contender.  I rate it right up there with Kaspersky 2010, my other favorite suite at the moment.

While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.
The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the ""old computer,"" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).
Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.
Using XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the ""clear type"" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a ""normal"" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).
I'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).

I loved art class in school because I had a whole room full of supplies, though I hated cleaning up. I was really looking forward to using this software because it simulates all of that messy stuff which is fun to use but not convenient. Fun times ahead!

It's mostly a fairly straightforward painting/editing program, but it has a whole ton of ""brushes"", both simulated real art tools (paint brushes, pens, spatulas, airbrushing, etc) and some wacky fun stuff like the ""image hose"" which lays down a trail of objects. If you're a skilled hand artist, or planning to become one, many of the brush types will be very useful in creating digital images which do look very much like they were created with brush, pen, or sponge strokes.

However, for what I expected to be a pretty high-end piece of software, I was disappointed with some quirks.

To avoid using the word ""tool"" (often used to refer to editing tools) and also avoid calling everything a ""brush"", I will refer to all simulated things as implements.

Some of the implements are too perfect and constant, and obvious patterns show. The ""loaded palette knife 2"" strokes with a pattern you might expect from a scraping painter's knife, but it NEVER CHANGES, down to the pixel. And unlike some of the other implements, there's no rounding or smoothing of the stroke to make it look convincing. It's exactly what you would get by copying and dragging a row of pixels in a paint program on an old DOS box. See the uploaded image, it's loaded with patterned artifacts. Utterly useless. Some others had similar problems, but I remembered this knife as the worst.

Some implements which rotate to match the stroke direction have a similar problem. They are completely 2-dimensional, and while they make delightful swirls of texture, they ALWAYS start and end with a completely flat row of pixels, just as no object in the univers would if used to draw. Again, it looks like the obvious result of a paint program.

One feature I was initially happy to see is the ability to zoom in with the mouse's scroll wheel. Why that isn't universal I have no idea, and being a detail hawk I am constantly zooming in and out at various points. Great! But it's silly, because using your scroll wheel will only zoom in to the exact center of your screen. The program doesn't care where your cursor is! So you have to first drag over to center whatever area you want to zoom in on. How did they not think to make it zoom in on the area I am pointing at? Yes, I can drag to the area first, but zooming in & out is something I might do literally hundreds of times while working on one image.

I was not able to figure out why trying to pick the crop tool sometimes jumps my focus down to the canvass layer, which is surely the last layer anyone would want to crop and move. Unlike some other things, there was no popup telling me why it didn't want to let me crop the paint layer.

Here's another silly thing. The escape key does not un-select things. If you use the select tool, and have the dotted box around an area then either perform some action or change your mind, you want to un-select the area. In every other program I have used, either ESC or ENTER will unselect the area and let you move on with your life, which is handy because you can draw with your right hand and hit keys like that with your left. In Corel, you have to use the ""reset tool"" on the menu bar. Again, it might not seem like a big deal but it interrupts the flow of an action you might do hundreds of times while working on a serious project. And it's not like the ESC key does anything else.

And finally, though the number of tools is impressive at first, it's all about buying upgrades. Want more brushes? Hand over a chunk of cash. It looks like the ""image hose"" is the same, and you can only use leaves and tires so many times before your work looks like a child got on your computer when you weren't there.  When the program first started, this really convenient learning interface popped up. Oh good, something to get me started! Not really, they're all ""30 lecture"" bundles you have to buy. No free 5-minute intro to using Corel's mediocre interface.

OpenOffice not doing a good enough job for what you need? Are you put off by Office 2013, which doesn't offer three product keys for your trouble? Are you even more put off with Microsoft turning Office into Software as a Service with Office 365?

Well, you're going to have to accept some compromises, namely the hated Ribbon and not having all the Office apps. But there are Z number of people who have late Windows XP/early Windows Vista era PCs that are perfect for secondary production running Windows 7 from a retail upgrade disk-and when you do the clean install upgrade for Windows, which you will eventually have to do due to Windows rot, you are going to need Office and you may never get up the budget to where you want to invest in Office 2010 or later for such a low-end often barely Aero-capable PC, so this is perfect as long as you temper your expectations.

With properly set expectations and a legal copy of Office 2007 Home and Student, you can now get down to how it works.

It works by running basic Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote tasks  It's not going to wow you like a new version of Office, but a common thread I've read in hundreds of reviews for various versions and editions of Office is why do they break what works in the previous version when they release a new version? Well, by buying an older version, there are no surprises as regards what Office can and can't do, because it's been around for however many years it's been since the date the version in question (Office 2007 Home and Student, which is 7 years as of when I write this) was made.

What can it actually do? Well, Word's fully featured (as long as you're using it for home or student use.) Excel is fully featured as regards the base program (again, the same caveat applies.) PowerPoint will get your presentations done, although you'll miss some of the customizations of later versions. OneNote is fully featured, and it along with PowerPoint have the caveat that they're for home or student use. The only thing that really lacks in Home and Student versus let's say Ultimate (which I use for troubleshooting through over-engineering), is the Microsoft Office Tools-you can't expect fancy things like Business Contact Manager and the accompanying copy of SQL Server 2005 Express.

In case you're wondering, I'm reviewing this for my aunt and uncle, who sat there and bought a PC in May of 2009 and thanks to a certain ability I have to troubleshoot combined with them buying retail Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade through the Best Buy fulfillment of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option that was current at the time along with retail Office 2007 Home and Student that they beat out of HP's customer (dis)service-albeit with having to pay for it, I get to (and thoroughly enjoy) troubleshooting their PC whenever it is having an issue because I'm on a mission to keep them off of the crack Windows that is Windows 8/RT/8.1/RT 8.1/Windows Phone 8X/Windows Phone 8.1x and I thoroughly enjoy every time I can fix their PC that uses this software.

Office 2007 Home and Student was a change for them at first from the WordPerfect Office suite they were using on their old XP computer, a Dell Dimension 2400 (They replaced it with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 7750+ 4GB RAM 500GB HD HP Pavilion Slimline S5120Y. But then again so was Vista and then 7-they didn't have too much trouble with Vista, but Windows 7 Home Premium combined with this version of Office makes them able to do everything they would ever want to do with Office and a PC. When that changes, they will upgrade-and so far it's not changing.

I just think that Office 2007 (whether lowly Home and Student or mighty Ultimate or something in between like Professional) didn't deserve the reputation it got as regards the Ribbon. People were (and some still are) so angry about the Ribbon that they don't like Office because of the Ribbon. I know I am not as qualified as some people to speak due to my aversion to command line interfaces, whether of the old school DOS/Unix variety or whether of the newfangled Windows PowerShell variety, but I know this for a fact:

Once I properly configured their PC with Windows 7 Home Premium Retail Upgrade on a clean install and reimported their programs, files, and settings, they were using it productively as could be until a virus hit that forced them to pay someone way too much to repair their computer. I was able to set it right and from the moment I first showed them how to do basic things like bold, underline, italics, margins, indentation, in other words showed them where Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student put the tools they were using in WordPerfect Office, they've been happily using Office with the Ribbon.

I hate to discount those who have had negative experiences with Office 2007, because I don't like most change-especially not the licensing restrictions growing ever tighter since 2000, but I haven't had any problems with the Ribbon either.

So with the Ribbon discounted for us and our family, we can now move on to infinitely more pressing matters. Which is how does Office (specifically 2007 Home and Student) perform in real world tasks? Well, it doesn't make you have to renew the usage rights to it every year, it supports the .docx/.xlsx/.pptx trio, and it has a user interface that aside from being different is actually usable (if you can figure out what each button on each section of the ribbon is for, which ToolTips really help with that and they're on by default).

In summation, for the reasons outlined above, Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student is worth the money if you can get a legal copy. I recommend it as long as it's needs match up well with what you need out of (specifically Microsoft) Office,

Take this as you will, 2 families' experiences with Office 2007, one Ultimate, one Home and Student, which is positive and we continue to use Office 2007 to this day.","It's maybe behind the curve, but you can still do a lot with it.",1391817600,,,need basic docx xlsx pptx capable version real microsoft office openoffice good enough job need put office offer three product key trouble even put microsoft turning office software service office well going accept compromise namely hated ribbon office apps z number people late window xp early window vista era pc perfect secondary production running window retail upgrade disk clean install upgrade window eventually due window rot going need office may never get budget want invest office later low end often barely aero capable pc perfect long temper expectation properly set expectation legal copy office home student get work work running basic word excel powerpoint onenote task going wow like new version office common thread read hundred review various version edition office break work previous version release new version well buying older version surprise regard office around however many year since date version question office home student year write made actually well word fully featured long using home student use excel fully featured regard base program caveat applies powerpoint get presentation done although miss customizations later version onenote fully featured along powerpoint caveat home student use thing really lack home student versus let say ultimate use troubleshooting engineering microsoft office tool expect fancy thing like business contact manager accompanying copy sql server express case wondering reviewing aunt uncle sat bought pc may thanks certain ability troubleshoot combined buying retail window home premium upgrade best buy fulfillment window upgrade option current time along retail office home student beat hp customer dis service albeit pay get thoroughly enjoy troubleshooting pc whenever issue mission keep crack window window rt rt window phone x window phone x thoroughly enjoy every time fix pc us software office home student change first wordperfect office suite using old xp computer dell dimension replaced amd athlon x gb ram gb hd hp pavilion slimline vista much trouble vista window home premium combined version office make able everything would ever want office pc change upgrade far changing think office whether lowly home student mighty ultimate something like professional deserve reputation got regard ribbon people still angry ribbon like office ribbon know qualified people speak due aversion command line interface whether old school do unix variety whether newfangled window powershell variety know fact properly configured pc window home premium retail upgrade clean install reimported program file setting using productively could virus hit forced pay someone way much repair computer able set right moment first showed basic thing like bold underline italic margin indentation word showed microsoft office home student put tool using wordperfect office happily using office ribbon hate discount negative experience office like change especially licensing restriction growing ever tighter since problem ribbon either ribbon discounted u family move infinitely pressing matter office specifically home student perform real world task well make renew usage right every year support docx xlsx pptx trio user interface aside different actually usable figure button section ribbon tooltips really help default summation reason outlined microsoft office home student worth money get legal copy recommend long need match well need specifically microsoft office take family experience office one ultimate one home student positive continue use office day,5990,1,1.0

More than once Ive heard people say that its one of the best (if not the best) titles in the series. But it also has a reputation for being fairly scary and having very complicated puzzles. I guess it was that reputation that turned me off to this game, but I finally ended up buying it because I felt like I couldn't call myself a true Nancy Drew fan without having played Curse of Blackmoor Manor. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.

Like I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.

CHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.

SETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.

PUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There weren't really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.

IS IT CHALLENGING? Absolutely. There was no way I could have figured out some of those puzzles without a walkthrough. 4.5/5

ENDING - 4/5: The ending was good, but not as strong as the other aspects of the game. The reveal at the end and the appearance of the culprit was kind of abrupt and a little underwhelming. The culprits motives made sense but I didn't really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.

This install was an upgrade from PP12 because it had been reinstalled too many times, causing blockage by Nuance.  I could have called them again but it was time to get the latest version.

I am a home user, who started with PagesPro then a Xerox product.  I like the product, particularly the image printing to PDF and the PDF editing features.  I use them regularly.

Unfortunately, with this edition, after a clean re-install of WIN7 Pro 64-bit the image printer driver refused to install -- the main program installed fine.  I called Nuance support, no 800 number available, was on hold forever and the best they could do was say try reinstalling with the firewall and anti-virus disabled.  That made no sense, the main program was installed and registered.

My  problem was with the printer driver install only.  There are a lot of us with that problem.  I read their posts.  I tried many workarounds with no meaningful help from Nuance.  Finally, I found a utility in the image printer driver's program folder for reinstalling the printer driver after an OS upgrade -  WORKED LIKE A CHAMP. To bad Nuance did not know enough to tell me to try it.

ALSO, there is a known bug in the standard version of PP14's update program.  It does not report any update!  There are many workarounds on the web for that as well, however, none worked for me.

That said, I couldn't figure out how to print something.  Took me a good 10 minutes to print something!  Now, I'm used to Photoshop and Gimp, and I was like ""Where are my tools?""
Tasks in this program are for the most part very automated, and the program performs them well. Functions like rotate and crop are OH so easy!
 One thing I really liked is that it has some special effects built in that are a bit like Alien Skin's and/or Nik's plug-in packages, and they come free, with nothing else to install or buy.  If you've ever bought plug ins like this, you will recognize that these are worth the price of the package.

I would have liked this program a lot more if not for some weird issue with providing a simple ""Save"" or ""Save As"" function.  You know, just those basic file functions in a basic file function sort of way.  The program has them all, of course, they are there, but the interface seems to hide them, in my opinion.  This can possibly cause disasters with working on a photo, and accidentally altering it without meaning to.

58,709,1233,7717,7717,4.0,False,"03 23, 2014",A23NSKTMSPPBTR,B00E6LJBUO,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},Wayne,"Although I've been using Quicken to track my expenses going back over 25 years, I never got around to installing the last several versions before this one. So I have to compare how much of an improvement there has been compared to the years before that. New versions (actually new releases, using the industry parlance that was in place when Quicken for DOS first hit the market) are iterative, add some new features, but are largely the same as older versions with only one or two significantly new or improved features. If you put this in a historical context, that's actually a good thing. When Scott Cook first came up with Quicken, he didn't take the traditional approach. He advertised in airline magazines rather than computer magazines and advertised to ""regular people"" rather than computer people. Instead of selling for the inflation-adjusted price of $854, which was common for spreadsheets, databases and word processors of the day, he sold the software for well under $100, inflation adjusted. And he sold annual updates for a price low enough that it was literally cheaper than buying an aftermarket book on how to use the product. They weren't major changes, but they were affordable. So when you pay a mere $39.99 for the entire product, depending on the version, you are benefiting from a revolution that Scott Cook single-handedly put in place to change the entire software industry.

In that sense, you get a lot for your money. When I first started using Quicken, it was an easy way to keep my checkbook balanced, and allowed me to print checks directly from a dot matrix printer. Over time, support was added for credit cards, investments, real property, and even business functions depending on the version. The software lets you look at the big picture when it comes to your finances. It lets you link accounts in such a way that you can see what comes out of one account when it goes into another account, or what goes from your cash account to your investment account or from your checking account to pay your credit card bills. It lets you keep track of your receipts and keep images of your checks or invoices with the individual transactions. And it keeps track of your securities, monitors the prices, and shows you how well your investments perform. It does so a lot better than tools you might find at your brokerage since there are so many ways of reporting things.

The latest version has cloud support and support for an app for your phone. Yes, it's limited to spending accounts and you will still have to use an app from your broker to get an instant view of your investments. Then again, you would need to do so to execute trades anyway. But for spending, it's a lot easier to snap a photo of a receipt with a smartphone than to scan it or enter it later, so when it syncs with the desktop app, it's easier to match things up with downloaded transactions.

It's come a long way from its origins, and although I no longer need it for printing out the checks to pay my monthly bills, I can use it to track more complex financial concerns such as stocks, bonds, options trading, ESPP shares, employee stock options, the value of my home, my mortgage payments with an ongoing view of principal and interest, and even paychecks with the amount split to account for federal, state, and local taxes, FICA, medicare and deductions for 401(k)s (which end up in the appropriate account register automatically) or healthcare spending or ESPPs. It lets you keep track of spending by categories, and allows for tags (formerly classes) so you can track things in multiple directions. If you want to get a report on spending by category or figure out how much you spent on education or dining, it's easy. And if you tag things so that you know which expenses were for your 2006 Hawaii trip, you can know how much you spent in total or break it down by airfare, lodging, meals or souvenirs. You can even use foreign currency and account for exchange rates.  You can use as little or as many of these features as you want. You can establish budgets and see how well you've been doing for years or decades, depending on how long you've been using the product.

The product isn't perfect and still has a few bugs in it that affect usability but not the underlying financial integrity of your data. And some tasks are easier than others. Some of the wizards work from some places and not others. And some areas are not optimized for the type of security. For example, options trading is a thinly disguised version of stock trading, won't let you use standard actions such as ""sell to open"", ""buy to close"" or expire contracts based on the date in the symbol and the price of the underlying security. You might need to use less obvious terms such as buying to cover at zero cost in order to close out expired contracts. And you need to view things as shares instead of contracts. Plus there's no price history for options. And there's no support for RSUs, despite the fact that the people in charge of Quicken have been granted RSUs, and thus can't use the product to track their own finances in a comprehensive way.

Despite the limitations, the product still covers the most common needs of most users. I'd like to see more emphasis on adding support for new features such as the ones I've mentioned, especially given that they aren't major programming tasks. I think the product has gotten so comprehensive that they are running out of ideas as to what to add for new releases.

The product also comes with three years of data service at no extra charge, after which you will most likely want to get a newer version. I think they would have had fewer detractors had they marketed the data service as a separate entity and let you know they are bundling it for free. The product itself does not expire, as many people think, but becomes a lot less useful once the data service expires and you can no longer download from your financial institutions. It's simply too expensive for the company to offer that kind of support for a longer period than what they cover, and it's cheap enough that even if you don't upgrade annually, it's worth getting a new version at least every two years.

70,816,1103,1400,1400,1.0,False,"05 24, 2008",A1IF2GNES3L2HC,B000HCVR3K,,Reader 7,"I recently bought a new laptop, and the changeover involved an ""upgrade"" to Office 2007. I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!
I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a ""power user,"" especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.
One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable. For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available. Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!
In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable! You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.
The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it ""thinks"" you will need at the moment. It is rarely right! ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier! There is one small ""tool bar"" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons. It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.
Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!
Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the ""improved"" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!
To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!
Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)
For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.
I have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case. I believe Microsoft tried to produce something ""different"" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past.

McAfee 2012 consumes 86 MB of memory (""private bytes"") and 412 MB of virtual memory.
Kaspersky 2012 uses 195 MB of memory (""private bytes"") and 596 MB of virtual memory.

Kaspersky 2011 was slightly nicer in that it reported the elapsed time to do a scan, the new version 2012 only reports when the scan finished.

Kaspersky's install is well done and impressive as it detected and removed traces of McAfee which were left behind after McAfee was uninstalled.

Kaspersky has one very valuable feature a ""rescue disk"" (a bootable disk which you can use for a clean scan of an infected system) which neither ESET nor McAfee provide.

Actually, the ribbon wouldn't be so bad if you could have your regular old classic menus above it.  Once you learn the ribbon, there's some logic to the way things have been relocated.  Still, this was a huge blunder and I wonder if MS will back track on that.

I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

Be very careful about Windows 10. If you have a custom rig, DO NOT CHANGE TO WINDOWS 10! I have a custom rig (not a typical store bought desk top) and Windows 10 is like a poison to it. Screen freezes up, frequent crashes, etc. I sorry I ever bought it and uploaded it. Since it was uploaded over 30 days ago, there is no going back to Windows 7. I can't believe Microsoft would market a software system that is not compatible with desk tops that are not store bought/that are customized.

I build my own.
I did the Win 10 free upgrade. I took a week to get completed.
Before adding the free upgrade--I upgraded my Win 7 PC to a 64-bit version.
And removed my PCIexpress cards.
I ran integrated.
I remained integrated for the following weeks using Win 10 Home.
But was able to return to a Win 7 environment.
Added back my PCIexpress audio and video.

It seemed more stable then the previous antivirus programs I've used, so I went ahead and updated it to Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 after about two weeks of use. Worked the same for a while until I started really noticing the difference between these programs and my last antivirus program, Spyware Doctor.

When I first installed Bitdefender Antivirus 2010, it found a couple of problems that Spyware Doctor didn't. However, since then it's found almost nothing, which is strange... when I used Spyware Doctor, I would scan every night and find four or five minor problems (tracking cookies, etc) over the course of a week. This program hasn't found anything in the last two months. I finally reinstalled Spyware Doctor and came up with several minor security risks that Bitdefender ignored. My definitions are automatically updated, so that isn't the problem.

After about a month of using it, I began having strange problems. First, Bitdefender's firewall suddenly began causing problems with programs that were normally allowed to access the internet. I tried removing them from the exceptions list then re-adding them, but nothing worked. I finally gave up and disabled Bitdefender's firewall and everything worked fine again. I emailed their support, but never received a response.

Second, around the same time I began having computer lockups... my computer would stop responding and run EXTREMELY slow. At the same time, the Bitdefender icon in the taskbar would turn grey with the message telling me that Bitdefender encountered a problem and I need to restart the computer. It usually cleared itself up within a few minutes, but would reoccur randomly. Sometimes it would go several days, other times it would happen two to three times in a single evening. I finally had to shut down the real-time monitoring, which seems to have cured this problem.

Well, after shutting down the process scanning and the firewall, and not being happy with the daily system scanning, what's left? Email scanning is flaky at best (will suddenly mark a single email in the middle of an entire conversation with a friend as 'spam'), and it's extremely slow (2-3x as long to check email). I also hate the fact that every time it finds a spam message it gives you a pop-up. I haven't found a way to shut these off, but by now I've given up and have moved on.
